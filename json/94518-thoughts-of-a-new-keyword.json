During such attack, progress is placed on an enemy instead of a damage. If there is progress on this enemy equal to or more than his Persuasion X value, then this enemy is added to the vicotory display.\n\n \n\nNote: Enemies with this keyword can still be attacked in normal way and go to discard pile if defeated.\n\n \n\n \n\nWhy I even bothered thinking about it? Well, the main reason was Crazed Captive. It didn't appealed to me that the only thing heroes can do about him is either kill him or let him scratch you turn by turn, and sometimes you even must kill him. He would thematically benefit from this keyword(threat raising won't trigger if \"persuaded\").\n\n \n\nMany things can be done with this keyword. As an axeample, Spirit Event card:\n\n \n\n\"Calm\" \n\nCost: 1\n\nText: Choose an enemy. Until the end of the phase, this enemy gains Persuasion X, where X is his remaining hit points.\n\nEdited December 3, 2013 by MyNeighbourTrololo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94518-thoughts-of-a-new-keyword/?do=findComment&comment=922511","commentId":922511,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1386131678,"content":"I like this idea. It reminds me of the way the Druadan Forest changes from a battle into a game of \"persuasion\" on the last quest stage.

Lesser human enemies in Heirs of Numenor cycle. Some creatures like Bear, presented along the game. Or even some lesser orcs or goblins, intimidating is some sort of persuading. Imagine. if some goblins had Persuasion X, where X is, let's say, 3 + 1 for each other Orc enemy in play.\n\n \n\nPersuasion is also may be a trigger for some rare positive effects from encounter cards, rather than just being a prevention of bad ones.\n\nImagine an enemy with response:\n\nAfter this enemy leaves game as a result of Persuasion keyword, player it was engaged with draws a card.\n\nEdited December 4, 2013 by MyNeighbourTrololo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94518-thoughts-of-a-new-keyword/?do=findComment&comment=922580","commentId":922580,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1386145155,"content":"I love Druadan Forest and one reason is the last stage in which you have to persuade the chieftain.

I too enjoyed the last stage of Druadan Forest, and I think you gave your keyword a nice touch by actually comparing the willpower against the enemy's threat strength rather than their defense.

Perhaps successful persuasion would stop the a creature attacking or making engagement checks that round.

That would mean you would attach X enemies to it with the archery keyword. before you could attack them you would have to clear the location away first by attacking it, as if it had the siege keyword. And in the meantime the enemies would be taking potshots at you, defended behind the location's walls.\n\nMaybe they would only begin taking potshots once you've travelled to the location though, which would make more thematic sense. you could even include the idea of reinforcements...maybe a treachery card could add some new archery reinforcements to every \"defended\" location still on the table"}]}
