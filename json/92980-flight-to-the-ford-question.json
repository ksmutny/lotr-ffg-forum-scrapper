According to the FAQ entry and original rulebook, \"surge\" resolves when the card is revealed from the encounter deck. Since the burden cards are being revealed from their own deck, and not the encounter deck, then the surge won't trigger. The reason they have surge on them is that they can get shuffled into the encounter deck for this quest and/or future quests, and the surge will activate when they are revealed from the encounter deck. This one definitely made me pause a bit and have to look up all the associated rules before it became clear.\n\nEdited November 3, 2013 by Raven1015"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92980-flight-to-the-ford-question/?do=findComment&comment=901737","commentId":901737,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1383505038,"content":"> Actually, the way the rules are written, the \"surge\" would not trigger at all, from either deck.

For some reason, I thought I remembered there being cards that actually reveal burdens from the burden deck, but that is not the case. I might have been thinking of the discard pile issue, where cards with surge revealed from the discard pile don't trigger the keyword."}]}
