I just think it makes way more sense. the way I do it and I do not think we will be changing until there is an official ruling\n\nThe argument that it is not as powerful relative to the cost of Khzad Khzad is not an argument.. card costs do not need to be relative or balanced. Just because Khzad Khzad is cheaper doesn't mean this should be the same cost or be relatively as powerful (or more powerful)\n\nNeither is the idea that high HP monsters have high defence argument.

I simply do not buy the argument.. \"well the card is not as powerful as I would like it to be so it should be able to be cast in this situation were it is a much stronger card\"\n\nEspecially when my rule variant is a common and repeatable game situation, that works game play wise and thematically AND match the rules.\n\nrichsabre said:\n\ni am swaying towards this….if so then, as stated previously, the better wording would have been 'when a dwarf PARTICIPATES in an attack that deals X damage…..'\n\nExactly… but it doesn't say that dose it?\n\nOur house rule is the only interpretation that is exact to the rules based on the CARD text, and as the FAQ and RULE book says \"the golden rule\" witch is that card text overrides ALL over game rules at the time they are read during effect payments and resolutions. So it is completely irrelevant how other attacks are calculated. As the card text over rides this.\n\nEvents are like passive global .. well events.. . You cast them and the game world changes for a second. Then after the event starts the resolution of the event begins and \"triggers\" of a game situation.\n\nResponse: After a Dwarf deals X damage to an enemy during combat, deal and additional X damage to that enemy. (Limit once per phase.)\n\nThis event targets a SINGLE dwarf, and then the event triggers of the condition on that SINGLE dwarf's dmg…\n\nI think this is pretty clear cut…\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68379-heavy-stroke-help/?do=findComment&comment=667443","commentId":667443,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1343870491,"content":" Confused here.

Like if you have Aragorn and Dwalin attacking a 1 Defence\n                    Monster with 5 Health….\n\n                    Is it…\n                   Arragon (3) + Dwalin (2) = 5 -1(Defence ) = 4 dmg + Heavy Stroke (double dmg) = 8 dmg Total\n\n                   Or is it..\n                   Aragorn (3) + Dwalin (2) = 5-1 Defence = 4 dmg + Heavy Stroke (Dwalin 2 -1 = 1 dmg doubled (2) )\n                  = 6 Dmg total?\n\n                   Thanks in advance\n\nCaleb:\n\nHi Booored,\nThe way Heavy Stroke is intended to work depends on allowing players to choose which character's attack value is applied to the enemy's defense value. In your example, the optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply Aragorn's attack 3 to the enemy's 1 defense. So Aragorn is dealing 2 damage to the enemy and Dwalin is also dealing 2 damage, at which point you play Heavy Stroke to double Dwalin's damage and make it 4 for a total of 6 damage dealt to the enemy.\n\nJust to clarify it further, let's say Aragorn and Dwalin were attacking an enemy with 4 defense. The optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply all 3 of Aragron's attack plus 1 of Dwalin's to beating the enemy's defensse, then Dwalin would deal 1 damage to the enemy that could be double with Heavy Stroke for a total of 2.\n\nHope that helps,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68379-heavy-stroke-help/?do=findComment&comment=667848","commentId":667848,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1343929090,"content":"i see, pleased thats clarified- guess it was the complex version gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68379-heavy-stroke-help/?do=findComment&comment=667897","commentId":667897,"userName":"schmoo34","timestamp":1343938696,"content":"richsabre said:\n\ni see, pleased thats clarified- guess it was the complex version gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\n\n\n \n\nIt wasn't the complex version, it was the only version that made any sense when you step back and see it from a 1000 foot view."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68379-heavy-stroke-help/?do=findComment&comment=667949","commentId":667949,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1343956235,"content":"richsabre said:\n\ni see, pleased thats clarified- guess it was the complex version gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\n\n\nA agree with your last answer to my latest post.
