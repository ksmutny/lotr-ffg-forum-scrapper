Bellach stays in the staging area for most of the quest and his threat equals the number of cards under Orc's Search.  He has a scour effect that makes each player search for an enemy and add it to the staging area.  Celebrimbor's Forge also starts in the staging area with the mold  attached to it, and you have to travel to it and explore it before it gets too damaged, otherwise you lose.  Both quest stages had \"Time 3: trigger all Scour effects in play\" on them, and you will always at least trigger Bellach's scour effect.\n\nIt's a combo heavy enctouner deck with loads of surge/other ways of bringing out extra encounter cards.  Playing two-fisted, I typically faced 3-5 encounter cards a turn.  The encounter deck is on the larger side, at least compared to the deck sizes we've been getting.  The scour combos are nasty and there's tons of \"choose x or y\" encounter cards, meaning there's lots of decisions to be made.   I imagine it will be easier solo (but not easy) and brutally hard in multi-player.  I played it two-fisted with two strong decks (Galadriel-Celeborn-Grima silvan and Gandalf-Boromir-Legolas from my Road Darkens play throughs) and squeaked out a victory my first (and only) time through.  The encounter deck almost TKO'd me on turn two by destroying Celebrimbor's forge, but I lucked out and it didn't.  I played aggressively, clearing the board as often as I could so that there weren't too many scour effects going off when time ran out.  Clearing locations is important too, because you don't want to lose them to the Orc's Search, but there are encounter cards that make it more difficult to explore locations.  The encounter deck does a good job of keeping pressure on you so that you never feel totally comfortable (well,until the final turn when I knew I'd win).\n\nOverall, I'd compare it to To Catch an Orc in that if you start fast and stay ahead of the encounter deck, you have a good chance of victory.  If you try to turtle and fall behind, you're going to be in a lot of trouble.  Lots of interesting mechanics, lots of strategic decision making, and I'll be interested to try it again and see how it goes.  I think the larger encounter deck and reliance on combos will make it play a little different every time.  The sweet spot for difficulty is probably two players.\n\nAnd NO MORE NALIR!!!! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] He totally ditches you at the beginning."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127057-celebrimbors-secret-playthrough-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1333737","commentId":1333737,"userName":"jjenks476","timestamp":1415923738,"content":"Sounds great.

The only one I didn't enjoy that much was The Dunland Trap.\nNot sure why you don't like it so much Glaurung?\n\nA few of them are definitely harder than most of the Dwarrowdelf or Mirkwood cycle (except RtM and Shadow and Flame), there are fantastic player cards in this cycle and the art is better than ever.\nThey were never going to be that difficult... its just a normal cycle not nightmare or POD so I'm kind of confused as to why you aren't enjoying it thus far?\nThe only thing I personally can really say against it is that each quest requires more set up and has more intricate mechanics than most earlier quests from the other cycles so it takes a bit more time to play these quests. This doesn't really bother me but I can see it being an issue with others.\n\nI think its potentially the best cycle or at least second best behind Dwarrowdelf.\n\nEdited November 14, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127057-celebrimbors-secret-playthrough-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1333830","commentId":1333830,"userName":"jjenks476","timestamp":1415930098,"content":"I found Trouble in Tharbad to be a pale comparison of Peril in Peralinger where it actually felt like you were in a city trying to avoid detection.

The random stage cards make the scenario unpredictable each time. 3 trials on the surface seemed more difficult, but once the formula for beating it was figured out it was pretty easy. It's difficult to come up with formula to beat Nin-in-eliph in The same way. I'm going to come back to this one regularly. It might be a new deck tester for me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127057-celebrimbors-secret-playthrough-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1335795","commentId":1335795,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1416088124,"content":"> I think CS will be a beast multi-player, but it's pretty easy solo.\n\n \n\nAww man. I was hoping for a good challenge for pure solo.

Nin was a problem any time In Need of Rest came out (partially because all my copies of Test of Will are in another deck...), but CS felt much like others have said: when it combos, the encounter deck is nasty, but once in control it's hard to lose control. I lost once from an excess of Orcs on the table, which Silvans can have trouble clearing.\n\n \n\nI like Galadriel a lot though. Her abilities are all useful - I like that her boost of willpower can allow you to quest with relatively few people, and have the back-up of adding 4 willpower just in case. If you don't use it, reduce threat and draw a card! Having allies auto-quest when they hit the table is amazing. Double use of original Gandalf (which I actually forgot about in my game, and exhausted him to quest!) is awesome. And Silvans are really fun to play. Powerful and fun, which is a good mix! Only stalling point was if the deck didn't draw either Galadriel's ring or O Lorien.
