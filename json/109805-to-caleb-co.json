As a veteran player (since the core set), it would be hard for me to count the number of cards that have higher effect on the game than this one. Indeed it is very difficult to understand that Unexpected Courage or Gandalf from the core set still reign free whilst this scholar is getting the shaft.\n\n \n\nI believe the errata was a reaction to the Master of Lore - Horn of Gondor - Erebor Hammersmith - Borne Aloft combo. Out of curiosity I have tried such a deck at the time and I can honestly say it was the most tedious, least thematic deck with a low chance of beating the harder quests. The combo of four different cards not only takes 12 slots of your deck right away but since you want to have it working as early as possible, more cards fuel that engine and do nothing else. Any quest that is tough on players from the start shall dismantle this naiveté. And the more you invest into setting the combo up, the less reward you get once it is set -- you still need resources to pay for the cards, and even Protector of Lórien cannot help you with all your accumulated trouble; and it would be (again) easier to put Will of the West on the black list.\n\n \n\nMore so, if the loop is needed to be stopped no matter what, then Master of Lore should probably be the last to be punished. Why not simply give Erebor Hammersmith limit once per round -- a limit we can see on the new events like Swift and Silent, and a limit which will otherwise not harm the Dwarven ally at all.\n\n \n\nIt seems obvious the designers have been careful with the errata and in general used it only against the obvious offenders like the ever greedy Zigil Miner. But, for some reason, Master of Lore is the one shiny exception to the trend, and his errata version is hardly usable.\n\n \n\nI am hoping other players will support this notion, which could result in a simple thing: we all shall have one more card to consider when building a deck, especially the mono-Lore which was one of the pursuits of the Against the Shadow cycle at the beginning of which Master of Lore arrived.\n\n \n\nThanks for reading!\n\nEdited July 1, 2014 by Ana"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109805-to-caleb-co/?do=findComment&comment=1139469","commentId":1139469,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1404198055,"content":"You're mistaken if you think that someone from designers would read this, respond to this or react to this."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109805-to-caleb-co/?do=findComment&comment=1139486","commentId":1139486,"userName":"ana4","timestamp":1404200386,"content":"It is quite certain designers do read the boards.

(you can separate both with hands / dunhere-quick strike for immunity ! with galadrim's greeting or elrond counsil etc...)\n\nRaven of the misty mountain for unlimited progress token.\n\nSnowborn scout or the like for unlimited progress token on location.\n\nThe end comes + Out of the wild to depleted completly the encounter deck.\n\nThe things remaining is quite few : immune location you need to travel to, and quest you need to wait for a certain phase.\n\n \n\nFor Massing, just survive first turn, even take undeffended attack and lose 2 hero if needed, all you need is those 5 cards in play, even if your last hero as still 1 hit point, you are fine.

Horn of Gondor is missing from the list above.\n\nUm yeah.. sorry :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Your correct. The \"combo\" works with out that, but the Horn is what makes it infinite and broken.\n\n \n\n\n\n> Maybe you are right but I think both the Hammersmith and Legacy of Dúrin are up for the errata ahead of Master of Lore. I cannot see how Master is so potent ante errata. I do not think it is easy to always find multiple cards of one type with a higher cost than 1. And if you have your deck filled with a majority of such, and you don't get Master, then you are in trouble.\n\nI haven't gone though the cards to check, but are there any other cards in the game that can be actives by the player which force a peppermint effect for a phase or round that is not an event? I can not really think of any.\n\nThe crux of it for me is that Master of Lore can always be abused. If not this combo, then one in the future. Remember MoL is not unique. So you can look at 4 drops for 1 cred. plus cards for the entire phase? This is open for abuse, as we have already seen. There will always be combos that can happen with this effect.\n\nI feel this errata is not about the combo at all, I think it is simply a correction as the card doesn't function in the way it should relative to the rest of the set. It is simply a printing or design error that needed to be fixed.\n\n \n\n\n\n> And if you have your deck filled with a majority of such, and you don't get Master, then you are in trouble.\n\nWell this is true with any \"combo\" deck. The very definition of them is that if the combo doesn't go off then they usually fail miserably. The errata is for how much easy the combo is to fire. In competitive games when facing a conbo deck all you need to do is disrupt the combo enablers. The more powerful the conmbo the less parts it has and the quicker it can run.\n\n\n\n> For Massing, just survive first turn, even take undeffended attack and lose 2 hero if needed, all you need is those 5 cards in play, even if your last hero as still 1 hit point, you are fine. It will be harder for massing, but if redo an optimal deck, I'm sure I can win this easily by turn 3 in 95% case. And tanking 2 turn is quite doable.\n\nSame, run Gimli. Do a undefended vs the wolf. There is a strong chance it will survive, stronger than you might think (check shadow effects), this places enough damage on him to instantly kill that same wolf that combat turn.\n\nThis is a good example of a quest that scales badly. It is harder wioth more players than solo, when it really should be harder solo imo.\n\nEdited July 2, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109805-to-caleb-co/?do=findComment&comment=1140666","commentId":1140666,"userName":"ana4","timestamp":1404282792,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > >  \n> > > \n> > > > It is quite certain designers do read the boards.

Great imagination is needed to decipher your mumblings in general (like the above) but sometimes it just gets too heavy.\n\nYour way of thinking and communication is very original. Like now, you probably find it important to staple people funny or not. Well, I do not think you are funny. You are pretty boring actually. You are a definition of a broken record. You repeat stuff all the time since the day 1 here, thinking people will start listening (or even watching your videos of the game which you try to advertise whenever possible without much success)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109805-to-caleb-co/?do=findComment&comment=1140676","commentId":1140676,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1404283422,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > >  \n> > > \n> > > >  \n> > > > \n> > > > > It is quite certain designers do read the boards. (Ever bothered sliding down the page?) It is also certain they react to some of the posts, with some errata coming directly from the boards, including Master of Lore, likely. My friend has gotten personal responses from them based on the boards, and some were addressed in either the FAQ or Second Breakfast articles. That still does not mean my particular trial will have any success, if your ignorant response is not enough. I did want reaction from the players, mainly, however.

Someone says something, you reply without much of a consideration, thinking the shorter the better, or the more scornful the more meaningful.
