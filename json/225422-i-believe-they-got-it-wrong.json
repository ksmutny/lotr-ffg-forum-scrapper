Elfhelm, however, doesn't say he cancels threat raise by 1, he says he reduces the threat. So my theory is that you successfully raise your threat and then you reduce it, so you tecnically explore the location with zero net threat raise."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225422-i-believe-they-got-it-wrong/?do=findComment&comment=2319119","commentId":2319119,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1469040453,"content":"what location is raising your threat?  what cards are you using in this example?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225422-i-believe-they-got-it-wrong/?do=findComment&comment=2319256","commentId":2319256,"userName":"donkler","timestamp":1469046049,"content":"> what location is raising your threat?  what cards are you using in this example?\n\n \n\nMy guess is Zigil Mineshaft:\n\n \n\nAction: Raise each player's threat by 1 to place 1 progress token on Zigil Mineshaft."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225422-i-believe-they-got-it-wrong/?do=findComment&comment=2319267","commentId":2319267,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1469046361,"content":"Elfhelm says \"After your threat is raised ... by an encounter card or quest card effect, reduce your threat by 1.\"  In the case of Zigil Mineshaft, the encounter card doesn't raise your threat, it just makes an optional player action available that can raise your threat."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225422-i-believe-they-got-it-wrong/?do=findComment&comment=2319408","commentId":2319408,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1469051474,"content":"On the other hand, there is this post https://boardgamegeek.com/article/17687642#17687642 [https://boardgamegeek.com/article/17687642#17687642]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225422-i-believe-they-got-it-wrong/?do=findComment&comment=2319419","commentId":2319419,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1469051861,"content":"I'm surprised, but a ruling from Caleb is about as definitive as it gets, absent a later ruling reversing it.\n\n \n\nSo if Caleb said it worked back in 2014, who is the \"they\" in the OP?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225422-i-believe-they-got-it-wrong/?do=findComment&comment=2319890","commentId":2319890,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1469090045,"content":"All the people saying it didn't work in the thread.
