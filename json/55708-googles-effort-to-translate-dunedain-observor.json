This effect should include the beastmaster of DG and future cards which raises the amount of dealt shadow card.\n\nIs it confirmed that the english cardtext is written in plural?

I don't think you can use it to cancel out both shadow cards dealt to Beastmaster DG cause then you'd cancel the effects on more than just one card AND since Bearsmaster cannot be \"just dealt\" unless he's dealt as a shadow card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55708-googles-effort-to-translate-dunedain-observor/?do=findComment&comment=551424","commentId":551424,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1320346435,"content":"@OnkelZorni: The English version of the card reads as follows:\n\n\"Response: Discard Dunedain Watcher from play to cancel the shadow effects of a card just triggered.\"\n\n@mr.thomasschmidt: This card is a little peculiarly phrased, but I think I agree completely with you.  You cancel all of the \"effects\" of a single (shadow) card that were just triggered.\n\nAn encounter card alone does not have any shadow effects, but shadow cards do (and something like a DG Beastmaster has more than one shadow card).  I suppose one shadow card could have more than one \"effect, but it seems easy to argue that the \"effect\" of a shadow card in some cases may simply do more than one thing... which is especially confusing because Hasty Stroke simply reads \"cancel a shadow effect just triggered during combat.\" I would have assumed that FFG would have simply re-used that phrasing for Dunedain Watcher, but in any case, I think what they were going for seems clear enough (discard the ally to cancel 1 shadow card)."}]}
