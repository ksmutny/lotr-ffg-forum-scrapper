It's the same reason why you can use A Very Good Tale to bypass the one ally a turn restriction in Escape from Dol Guldur.\n\n \n\n(1.16) The phrase “put into play” If a card effect uses the phrase “put into play,” it means that the card enters play through a card effect instead of through the normal process of paying resources and playing the card from hand. “Put into play” effects are not considered to be playing the card, and will not trigger any effects that refer to a card being played. “Put into play” will, however, trigger any effects that occur when a card “enters play”.\n\n \n\n-From the FAQ\n\nEdited July 18, 2016 by CaptainAce"}]}
