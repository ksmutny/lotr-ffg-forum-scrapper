Is it correct?\n\nI ask because a my friend say that is the player A that have to draw the card because he is the owner of the attachment, even if it is controlled by player B.\n\nWho is right?\n\nThank you in advance"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122031-control-of-attachment-legacy-of-durin-as-example/?do=findComment&comment=1262442","commentId":1262442,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1410736216,"content":"Player B draws the card.\n\n \n\nOnly the controller of a card can activate its effects (like Actions and Responses) unless the card specifically says otherwise.  Player B activates Legacy of Durin's Response, so Player B draws the card.\n\n \n\nWhen Durin of Legacy gets discarded, it will go to its owner's discard pile (Player A)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122031-control-of-attachment-legacy-of-durin-as-example/?do=findComment&comment=1263398","commentId":1263398,"userName":"Emilius","timestamp":1410797188,"content":"Ok perfect!\n\nThank you very much"}]}
