These cards are referred to in the game as “unique.” They are marked with a symbol before their card title to indicate their uniqueness.\nIf any player has a unique card in play, no player can play or put into play another card with the same title. Any attempt to do so will fail to the extent that the card attempting to enter play remains in its current location (hand, deck, discard pile) and does not enter play. This rule applies to all unique hero, ally, attachment, and event cards that might enter play. Note that a unique card is eligible to enter play if another card with the same title is in a player’s discard pile but not currently in play. Multiple copies of the same non-unique card can be in play simultaneously.\""}]}
