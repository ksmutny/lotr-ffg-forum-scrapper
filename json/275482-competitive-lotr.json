It seems quite interesting of a concept to release new sets with ability to modify them and let other players quest them.\n\nWhat will be the consequences of this for the older cards? more errata? rotation?\n\nAre you interested in competitive play?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/275482-competitive-lotr/?do=findComment&comment=3321870","commentId":3321870,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1525772667,"content":"I would be interested in comparative solo (like in the Legendary leagues on boardgamegeek) if there were a scoring system I thought was meaningful for this purpose.  The official scoring method doesn't fit that description for me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/275482-competitive-lotr/?do=findComment&comment=3321877","commentId":3321877,"userName":"Devaresh","timestamp":1525773343,"content":"I think it sounds very exciting on a lot of different levels, but I don’t think it will be a regular thing.

The biggest problem is that the game is essentially \"solved\". We know what the best player decks are; I don't think being able to tweak the contents of the encounter deck is likely to do much to counter decks like The rapid charge of Outlands [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1251/the-rapid-charge-of-outlands-2.0], for instance. The game isn't well balanced for competitive play.\n\nAll that being said, I'm still super excited about the idea of having some structure for building our own encounter decks. That's something I've wanted to do for a long time! I'm hoping this will lead to a trend of people publishing their own encounter decks online for others to play. That's something I would enjoy doing all the time."}]}
