Emery doesn't apply here since discarding 3 cards is part of the cost to put her into play. But looking at something like Imladris Stargazer:\n\nAction: Exhaust Imladris Stargazer to choose a player. That player looks at the top 5 cards of his deck and then returns them to the top of his deck in any order.\n\n \n\nIf your deck has 4 cards left and you use her, her effect only partially resolves.

At first I was only ever using it on allies that were exhausted but after really reading it carefully I thought huh... it says choose and ready up to 2 allies. And I started thinking about that. I can certainly choose 2 allies exhausted or not and it's curious that it doesn't say choose up to 2 exhausted allies and ready them. So I came to understand that the card was basically saying: the cost to run this action is to exhaust the weilder and Narya and the benefit is to provide the player with two readied allies +1 def and +1 att. If they are already ready then that part of the card doesn't trigger you just give em the buff. Or you could say the ready benefit was already fulfilled.  \n\nPlaying this way made Narya a pleasure to play.  Before I'd always skirted round putting it in my decks as  I thought it was too conditional only being able to use it on an exhausted ally. Or I'd play it and then not get the use out of it I needed due to the readied state of my allies. \n\nIt always felt like the weakest of the rings. It seams odd now that I thought the ring of power only gave power to exhausted allies... and not give power to allies ready for action. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219926-partially-fulfilling-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=3403886","commentId":3403886,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1531488730,"content":"And you can always exhaust an ally to defend, then trigger Narya to buff its defense before the attack resolves, and have the ally ready to attack at plus one as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219926-partially-fulfilling-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=3403908","commentId":3403908,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1531489766,"content":"You could choose exhausted allies.
