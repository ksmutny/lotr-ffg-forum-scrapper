It's a heck of a lot of fun.\n\n \n\nYour question is quite common and has been well answered by this series of articles on Tales from the Cards: https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/new-player-guides/ [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/new-player-guides/]\n\n \n\nIn fact, this section of the article directly addresses your question: https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/5-things-i-wish-i-wouldve-known-when-i-started-playing-lotr-lcg/ [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/5-things-i-wish-i-wouldve-known-when-i-started-playing-lotr-lcg/]\n\n \n\nIan's new player guide is very well-written and thoroughly researched - it is a highly recommended read for folks who are just starting off the game and know they are going to get more involved with LOTR:LCG.\n\n \n\nStill, each player is likely to have their own unique response to your question. Here are a few of my responses to your question.\n\n \n\n1) Most importantly (in my view) - this is a cooperative game in which you will either team with other players or play solo in attempt to succeed against the quest. How you decide to play the game is entirely up to you and your play-group, i.e. how you define \"having fun\" with LOTR:LCG is your call. If you forget or don't exactly understand how a rule works, don't worry about it. Just enjoy the experience.\n\n \n\n2) Owning 2 or more Core sets is not essential - I own 3 Core sets and am happy that I do. That said, you absolutely do not need to shell out more money on additional Core sets. Yes, you will acquire duplicate copies of very powerful cards that come in the Core set such as Unexpected Courage, Steward of Gondor and Test of Will. These cards really help, but you can always proxy them if you want to run them, or play without them and do just fine. The tracking components are really nice, but again there are easy ways to play the game without them. Dice, tokens, pen and paper, etc all let you track information just fine. There are also various computerized versions of the game, too.\n\n \n\n3) The community for this game is quite friendly - in my experience the LOTR:LCG community is very friendly, both on-line and in-person. A few people might give you a hard time if you post something they disagree with, but this is rare. Most of the time folks are quite willing to answer questions and give advice on these forums and on Boardgamegeek. My in-person experience has been even better. LOTR:LCG players love this game and want to share that enthusiasm with others they meet at the table.\n\n \n\n4) Player cards in the various releases are universally playable in all quests - you may or may not be familiar with the game's various product lines at this point. There are essentially 3 types of product lines for LOTR:LCG: Deluxe expansions and the Adventure Pack Cycles that follow it, Saga expansions, and GenCon/Fellowship quests (these are quests only, no player cards). Player cards can be found in the first two product lines and can be used with any deck against any quest. The only minor exception is that you will find some special cards in the Saga products (Treasures in the Hobbit boxes and Boons/Banes in the Lord of the Rings boxes) that can only be played with those products.\n\n \n\n5) Deck-building is necessary to succeed at this game - you can manage to win with the stock, mono-spheres decks in the Core set, but it will be hard and infrequent. This means that you must deck-build to succeed against quests consistently. Presumably you were aware of this when you purchased the game, but some new players are not and may become frustrated when they discover this aspect. In regard to deck-building there are essentially three approaches; one deck to rule them all, quest-specific, and thematic. One deck to rule them all decks are designed to be so powerful such that they can overcome any quest in the game. The game is mature enough now that many cards exist to support this archetype and they do work. Such decks are unquestionably strong and can be fun, but they tend to rely on a number of powerful cards as their foundation. As a result you may find the play-style to become rather stale as you must include these cards in every Rule deck you make. Quest-specific decks consist primarily of cards you identify as critical for beating the quest you are currently playing against. This style of play is not necessary for every quest, but certain quests will make it mandatory (Journey to Rhosgobel is an example). Thematic decks are the last style and are built with cards that follow a certain theme that appeals to you, such as through certain types of creatures or races (i.e. Eagles, Hobbits, Dwarves, Gondor, Rohan, etc) or perhaps match a story theme (Boromir/Faramir/Denethor or Aragorn/Gimli/Legolas as heroes supported by a deck of cards that is thematically consistent with those heroes). Thematic decks could be either a one deck to rule them all or quest-specific.\n\n \n\n6) Don't purchase Nightmare decks until you are experienced with the game and own a good-sized card pool - Nightmare decks are existing quests with new cards added to make the quest harder, but also more interesting. Unless you decide to acquire a big collection of player cards quickly or are absolutely certain to collect everything in this game, it's simply not worth it to purchase Nightmare decks until you've played for a while and own a good assortment of cards.\n\nEdited July 6, 2016 by RobOz"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224331-what-do-you-wish-you-had-known-when-you-started-and-what-should-i-buy-next/?do=findComment&comment=2297792","commentId":2297792,"userName":"MrTopHatJones","timestamp":1467817213,"content":"> Hello and welcome to the game!

The linked articles are great.\n\n \n\n1. We're getting better with this as a play-group since starting Eldritch Horror. We've spent a lot of time with Armada so we're familiar with trying to kill each other, just not as much with trying to help each other.\n\n2. I don't intend on buying a 2nd core set; if one of my friends wants to, mazel tov to them, but there are enough expansions that I think I'll put my resources there.\n\n3. That's true in general for a lot of communities, and particularly for the cooperative-style games: competitive games have friendly players \"to a point\", then they can fit the stereotype of... well, of miniatures gamers.\n\n4. Cool.\n\n5. Again, coming from Armada, fleet-building is one of my favorite parts of the game.

As always recommended, consider each cycle of 7 expansions one unit. FFG design them as such, so the smaller packs include player cards meant to help with the deluxe's quests (or at least fit thematically). I'm not sure if they did it originally from the Mirkwood days, but there's some sort of pattern to the cards, so they planned more than 20 cards at a time.\n\n \n\nEach cycle (and saga expansion) technically only requires the core, but in practice you'll probably want as many player cards as possible to stand a fighting chance. The more variety you have, the more different approaches to deckbuilding you can try to tackle a quest. Plain fighting seems to be less favoured than questing, but be prepared for anything (i.e. have all spheres available, or at least enough tricks among what you've got).\n\n \n\n> While I agree it is best to get the expansions in order if possible, it can be difficult to find what you want in stock, and the reprints from FFG can take some time.

I use five regular places which usually get me everything among them. Ordering all of Dwarrowdelf took 4 sources. I also ended up with The Lost Realm as my second deluxe expansion due to it just sitting there in a bargain bin. The player cards in any expansion are always useful though, and that one has a few neat ones.

It must also be admitted that a couple of quests in the first cycle (i.e. Hills of Emyn Muil) are perhaps a little weaker than others. However if you go only for the best quests (and your mileage may vary as to what they are), then you're missing out on character cards that you could use, and even the weaker quests are still good.\n\n \n\nFollowing the above, my recommendation is to try and buy and play them in order for at least the first two cycles."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224331-what-do-you-wish-you-had-known-when-you-started-and-what-should-i-buy-next/?do=findComment&comment=2304637","commentId":2304637,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1468266178,"content":"Half the cards in each pack are useful no matter which quests you play, or at least enough cards that I haven't regretted a single purchase out of the first two cycles.

That is good. My tips:\n\n \n\n * Don't give up. I've had hero's die on turn 1 and still won in the end.\n * Don't neglect threat management. Early on I always went for the most powerful heros but you need to balance that with threat management.\n\nI started out with 1 core set, then bought another and the whole mirkwood cycle. I really enjoyed playing through the whole cycle, together they tell a story and are fun to play through. I often play with 3 or 4 players so the extra core set was good so everyone can have a threat tracker, plus everyone one wants multiple Gandalf's in their deck.\n\n \n\nJust got The Black Riders this week. Trying it out tonight for the first time. Excited to try Saga!"}]}
