In your example, you want X=2. You have to spend 2 resources from Spirit heroes, now. Then you choose an ally with a printed cost of 2, which could be Gleowine. Now, Stand and Fight puts Gleowine into play. You do not have to spend any more resources to do this."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114374-stand-and-fight/?do=findComment&comment=1220644","commentId":1220644,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1408784741,"content":"Not this again...well now i have to play almost all quests again where i have been used spirit heroes :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] (and believe me, there are lots of them)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114374-stand-and-fight/?do=findComment&comment=1220700","commentId":1220700,"userName":"jormungandr","timestamp":1408788608,"content":"Playing all quests again?
