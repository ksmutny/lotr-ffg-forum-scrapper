Does Bolg's effect cause it to surge? I think so, but the round technically hasn't started yet, so I want to be sure. Also, if it does, does it count as the \"first Goblin enemy revealed this round?\"\n\nAs far as I know, the goblin would surge, and it would fulfill Bolg's effect for the round; but I wanted to be sure I played it right."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282313-bolg-and-first-goblin-each-round/?do=findComment&comment=3464895","commentId":3464895,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1536537840,"content":"I believe it does, but I donâ€™t have anything official to back me up at the moment. Although something might exist. And if it does surge, I believe the first goblin you get during staging that round will NOT surge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282313-bolg-and-first-goblin-each-round/?do=findComment&comment=3464919","commentId":3464919,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1536540809,"content":"Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282313-bolg-and-first-goblin-each-round/?do=findComment&comment=3465303","commentId":3465303,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1536594106,"content":"On the most recent news set-up is part of the first round.
