While different I would rank Bilbos ability lower in terms of power. Two damage is great as it opens up some neat tricks with Gondorian spearman and spear of the citadel, but how often do enemies guard stuff? Sure there are a handful of player cards and some quests, making it  quite niche. And dealing one damage is not too great. Argalad already does something very similar and profits from stuff like light of valinor etc. Ofc he is in lore and usefull quester shouldn't be too common in tactics, but other spheres are more generous in adding \"out of sphere stats\" I feel.\nBilbo probably will be good in mono tactics anyway for the (most likely) above avarage willpower, but with 6 or seven willpower I would have been much more happy. Would have made him more interssting for secrecy, too (and this is his Burgluar version, so he should be sneaky).

And before someone complains, that he needs an attachment to be worth his stats, look at Galadriel: While she has an awesome ability, she cannot use her willpower for questing, so without Nenya she is even more overpriced than Bilbo (5 extra threat compared to 3).

Essentially he negates the threat of one enemy and damages him in the process. Imagine a solo game with an enemy in the staging area, only Bilbo commits to the quest and a treachery is about to be revealed (one that does not increase threat in any way). If the enemy has 1 threat, Bilbo will have 2 willpower, quest succesfully, deal 1 damage and place 1 progress. If the enemy has 5 threat, Bilbo will have 6 willpower, quest succesfully, deal 1 damage and place 1 progress. If there is an empty staging area, Bilbo will have 1 willpower, quest succesfully and place 1 progress.\n\nSo in the end, it does not matter how much threat the enemy has, the result will be the same(save for the damage). It's more like a repeatable Radagast's Cunning without cost, but a damage component instead.\n\nAnd why would Tactics be bad for him? Most direct damage cards are in this sphere anyway.

Something like a Goblin Sniper, Orc Vanguard, Cave Eel, Umbar Assassin, Carn Dûm Garrison, Island Watcher etc. Trolls, Giants and Mumâks tend to have too many hitpoints to kill them this way. You could also compare Bilbo to Thalin: The former provides potentially more willpower and damage over time, while the latter can deal more damage per round.\n\nAnd let's be honest, while a hero like Beravor has a 10 statpoints, most likely they will not be used, as Beravor will draw cards.

Lore glorfindel is probably the worst designed hero of the core set and difficult to bring back to regular play. His ability/sphere make him difficult to play. His cost/stats is totally fine.  But we had from cycle two better alternatives for questing and attacking (Elrond plus light of valinor equals glorfindel in terms of Acton attack and elrond abities are among the best in the game. Aragorn hit for 3 and had an ability totally game changing at the time of release). Basically with lore glorfindel you have a very good hero in terms of stats with high cost equalling those stats and basically no ability which is a crime for an high cost hero. Not enough considering all best alternatives around."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287309-mount-gundabad/?do=findComment&comment=3560323","commentId":3560323,"userName":"ColinEdwards","timestamp":1544193220,"content":"Fatty and Pippin need:\n\nHobbit Sense: 1 cost - spirit - after your threat is raised by a player card, discard Hobbit Ferocity to grant each Hobbit hero you control +1 attack, defense, willpower until the end of the phase.

In many deck you will play the best (or the top 2 may be) card of your hand and then recycle the rest to see essential cards. It give you the maximum chance to see your best cards on turn one, since you can even play another one.

We found much harder The Ghost of Framsburg (it took us three tries to win, while one was enough for Mount Gundabad), probably because our decks can't handle very well lots of threat increases (and also because there are quite a few effects in The Ghost of Framsburg which block readying effects, around which we build a lot) and are instead very well versed in handling brutal combats so Mount Gundabad was easier for us. Playing Mount Gundabad we ammitedly had some luck with the quest order at the beginning (less so afterwards) and we were able to finish it in the combat phase of the 6th turn.\n\nIn any case they are both very thematic and interesting quest, especially Mount Gundabad that really sold the whole \"wandering in the ruins with a dragon roaming around\" feel.

So if you think you need healing and include Glorfindel, you're going to be including Glorfindel *and* some other healing cards on top of that. This shifts his role in a deck. His ability doesn't provide the cornerstone which makes your deck work, he ends up providing 'insurance' basically.  \n\nI've thought some about cards which would revitalize lore Glorfindel specifically, but have come up blank.  Any idea I has would end up being overpowered by the existence of other cards.  Ideas revolve around 1) providing some benefit when you pay a resource to activate a hero card's Action ability, or 2) providing some benefit when healing a card.  Either would make other existing cards too powerful.  I guess you could make it super restricted or even make it \"Attach to Glorfindel,\" but I tend to dislike cards that belong to 1 and only 1 character."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287309-mount-gundabad/?do=findComment&comment=3632340","commentId":3632340,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1550978306,"content":"Instead of a new card, Lorefindel just needs a higher limit for his action, as you said.
