The end of the turn arrives, and Saruman leaves play.\nWe are now dealing with a Forced effect from Silvan Refugee that trigger on Saruman leaving play, and a Forced effect from Cave Entrance that trigger on end of turn but could not have been resolved before Saruman left play. What is the right order of resolving this?\nA: At the end of the round, you discard Saruman. That immediately triggers the Forced effect on Silvan Refugee, discarding it from play. Now it is still the end of the round when Cave Entrance is considered to be in play again, so you would need to trigger its ability before beginning the next round.\nhttp://sdajce.forumactif.org/t2254p15-question-effets-en-fin-de-tour-saroumane-entree-de-la-caverne-refugie-sylvain-reponse-officielle [http://sdajce.forumactif.org/t2254p15-question-effets-en-fin-de-tour-saroumane-entree-de-la-caverne-refugie-sylvain-reponse-officielle](French)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232746-annuminas-stage-2f/?do=findComment&comment=2467452","commentId":2467452,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1476988211,"content":"I just emailed Caleb and he said I was correct."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232746-annuminas-stage-2f/?do=findComment&comment=2467651","commentId":2467651,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1476995712,"content":"Beginning of the round is a much neater concept than End of the round for these sorts of effects, because it's clear when things happen.
