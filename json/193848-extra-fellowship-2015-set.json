I am looking for either an alt-art Gimli or an AGOT 2.0 \"A Game Of Thrones\" promo which I believe was given out at Gencon and some more at Worlds. Is anyone up for a trade? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Alternatively I guess I could sell it and buy said AGOT promo but would be easier to do a straight trade!Â "}]}
