Terrible work there from the main dudes. I simply can not believe it. It makes sense rule wise.. but it is just a terrible designed card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98799-question-on-bifur-from-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=980549","commentId":980549,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1392055905,"content":"1. Don't say things are retarded, it's not acceptable.\n\n2. How is that one of the worst rulings you've ever seen? Just seems like more dwarven synergy to me."}]}
