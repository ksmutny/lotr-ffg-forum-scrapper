I find the Path to be most useful when playing solo as a way to bypass the Necromancer's Pass, Gladden Fields and Mountains of Mirkwood. Obviously, if you're playing mostly Khazad-Dûm, then Ancestral Knowledge becomes better.\n\nYou should really consider switching Bifur. Denethor would give you a second shot at peeking at the Encounter Deck (having a single core limits you seriously as you only have one Hemanarth Riversong) and he's better than Hobbits at defending while still being eligible to A Burning Brand. If you do that, you can also remove one of the Boots from Erebor. You could replace it with any of Lore of Imladris, Self Preservation or Daughter of the Nimrodel. This would also increase your 2-3 ratio for the Miners."}]}
