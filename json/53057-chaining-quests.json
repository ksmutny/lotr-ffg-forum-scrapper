Like Passage Through Mirkwood, then Hunt for Gollum (in place of Journey), then Escape from Dol Guldur. I don't think dropping Passage and trying two 4s and a 7 or a 4 and two 7s would lead to much success.\n\nDoing the Expert level option where you can reset threat and decks could probably be expanded beyond three total quest scenarios. A deck that's good enough to beat the first three core scenarios is probably good enough to take on Hunt and Carrock.\n\nI don't have a copy of Rhosgobel yet so can't comment on the difficulty of that one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53057-chaining-quests/?do=findComment&comment=527417","commentId":527417,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1315889719,"content":"I actually play all the Quests as a campaign now, and it's really good fun. I play them in this order, based on how I perceive their difficulty in solo play (difficulty level as defined by me, myself and I in brackets):\n\nMirkwood (1), Gollum (3), Carrock (4),  Anduin (5), Dol Guldur (8).\n\nOnce I get Rhosgobel and Osgiliath and the rest I'll play those as single games a few times before assigning a difficulty level and slotting them in.\n\nThen I score my campaign as follows: a win is scored as per FFG's system, a loss is 80 points. I add up the scores of all the games in the campaign and divide them by the sum of the difficulty levels of all quests I beat = 1. So if I lose all five of the quests I currently have, the score would be (5*80)/1 = 400, if I win every game with a score of 20, the overall score would be (5*20)/(1+3+4+5+8+1) = 100/22 = 4.5.\n\nAfter a campaign I build a new deck, and I'm now actually trying out every combination of major and minor sphere this way.\n\nObviously this way of campaigning ignores the story arc, although they're all adventures in or around Mirkwood so still lots of flavour. I just really like the building up towards the tougher scenarios that this order of quests gives me. Dol Guldur is normally a 5-minute 80-points game but well...that's Dol Guldur for ya.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53057-chaining-quests/?do=findComment&comment=527510","commentId":527510,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1315909273,"content":" You put Carrock as a four???\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure that I can really conceive of beating that scenario solo.

(Maybe if I had multiple core sets and got really lucky with drawing Sneak Attacks and Gandalf....)\n\n\n\n3/5 for me so far, solo with one core set and the 2 adventure packs.\n\n \n\nWon it with a crazy four-sphere deck (Legolas/Frodo/Beravor/Song of Kings) which had to battle all Trolls at once as threat was in the low 40s, but also with a Spirit/Leadership deck which kept threat low and picked off the Trolls one by one. None of the wins I can recall had Gandalf all over it; he did come out once or twice but didn't decide the outcome all by himself.\n\n \n\nSo far it's given me a lot less trouble than Anduin, mainly because you can almost decide when to go into battle on your own terms rather than having a Troll flung in your face when you're barely out of the blocks.\n\n \n\nAlthough 5 games obviously isn't a huge sample size, so maybe the losing streak starts here...\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53057-chaining-quests/?do=findComment&comment=527735","commentId":527735,"userName":"Puzzle2","timestamp":1315943194,"content":"I have a Leadership/Lore deck that I tool around with during each AP and for Carrock I have won 2/3 attempts with scores of 30 and 33. \n\nI also have a Tactics/Spirit Deck that lost three times in a row so I am going to go back and rethink my strategy.

We played the three Core Set scenarios and mixed in Gollum when it was new (with the order being Mirkwood - Anduin - Gollum - Dol Guldur). Those have actually been the most fun games we had so far. Not only do you worry about beating the scenario, but you start worrying about which cards you use and which you want to save for the next one.\n\nFor two players, it is possible to go through the three Core Set scenarios with decks consisting of only a single Core Set, and we once managed four scenarios with Gollum thrown in. Theodred was dead, and we ended the game on threat levels of 48 and 49. It's really challenging and a lot of fun!
