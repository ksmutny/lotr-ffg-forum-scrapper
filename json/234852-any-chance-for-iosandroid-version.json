I just got my copy of the LOTR, it arrived from overseas (cause in my country there is no single copy available for purchase) and now I'm struggling with tutorials and watching youtubes trying to get into the game.\n\nIt would be a lot easier though for people like me to use a tablet or smartphone app to get into this game. Like Ascension Chronicles of the Godlslayer card game, which exists both in box and app form. It would bring more popularity to the game too I think. Why didn't the publisher introduce the app yet? Does anyone know their opinion on it?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234852-any-chance-for-iosandroid-version/?do=findComment&comment=2508766","commentId":2508766,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1479682446,"content":"1) I don't know of any apps by FFG\n\n2) Partially because of #1 I doubt that they have the devs for it.\n\nI feel like they just want to be a physical card game shop.

If the condition affects players, it will have to be manual on the players' end either way. "}]}
