can make to fix these issues, avoiding the much abhorred errata of a new card (which is way more of a taboo to designers than players) or disastrous Set-Up changes.  In step 2, when Side A instructs you to put it into play, just sit the guarded card in the staging area.  Then, at the end of step 7, when the quest is set-up and ready, deal it a guarded card.  It's a little wonky, but it fixes every problem and I think it is the truest implementation of how everything is supposed to work.\n\nI wouldn't mind deferring the Guarded effect until the end of set up, but I also think issues that arise from playing a Guarded card at step 2 are not an issue unless they *break* the quest in the player's favor.  Choosing a Guarded attachment with Grey Wanderer is a choice, and if a player choice makes it impossible for the player to win via bad interaction, that's a choice a player should not have taken and is completely avoidable -- much like putting Ungoliant's Spawn in the victory display for Passage Through Mirkwood, there's no need for errata when it's completely avoidable.  Likewise, if some quest interaction lets a Guarded card get into play free or cheaply, good for the player!  That's not game-breaking, it's just good tactics.  But if a Guarded play has the potential to neuter the entire quest (in the player's favor), then it's possible a Grey Wanderer deck could ruin a quest for a whole table by choosing a Guarded card.  Are there any quests that actually fit that description?\n\nThere is an annoyance factor with step 2 guarded, though, in that in practice I don't actually shuffle the encounter deck until I *have to*, which means that if I'm searching for cards to set aside I never actually bother shuffling them into the enoucnter deck in the first place."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3967985","commentId":3967985,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1596224599,"content":"Setup

At the current state of doing contract setups in step 7, is that correct that Folco’s threat reduction isn’t recognizing the hobbit ally turned hero?\n\nLet's say your intended starting heroes are Folco, Gandalf, and MotK-Bilbo. With step #7 contract setup, this is the relevant sequence of events:\n\n * At step #2, all [printed] heroes are placed simultaneously, so Folco & Gandalf hit the table. Their text is active immediately, so when you then set your starting threat to the sum of their threat costs, Folco takes the one Hobbit hero he can see—himself—into account, and you get 6+14=20\n * At step #7, MotK's Setup fires. You fetch Bilbo and add the sum of his stats (4) to your starting threat, yielding 24. (Folco's threat cost is now 5, but it doesn't really matter, as the moment in the game where you access his threat cost already passed at step #2. In that sense, it's not much different than putting Sword-thain on a Hobbit ally later in the game.)\n\nSo, RingsDB is correct in this case.\n\n \n\n> 3 hours ago, bdavis969 said:\n> \n> If contracts went back to step 2, would that hobbit ally turned hero then be recognized by Folco?\n\nIf contract setup were indeed back at step #2, AFAICT it's actually still a little arguable whether the interaction would allow Folco to see the additional Hobbit hero. Intuitively, of course he would, but the way that step #2 and MotK are written, there are two paths I see:\n\n 1. MotK Setup happens after the regular events of step #2. This essentially leads to the same outcome as the current state of things—Bilbo becomes a hero too late for Folco's lowered threat cost to functionally matter.\n 2. MotK Setup happens before the regular events of step #2. Now MotK is adding a number to an not-yet-defined starting threat. Even if you assume that \"undefined\" can be taken as 0, because MotK does not actually define a threat cost for Bilbo, the regular step #2 stuff will then entirely erase whatever you did beforehand, and you'll end up with a starting threat of just Folco & Gandalf, now 5+14=19. This seems incorrect.\n\nIf you truly want the MotK hero to enter play at the exact same time as your printed heroes and be perceived exactly like a printed hero for something like Folco (i.e., MotK Setup happening during the regular events of step #2), you'd not only have to have step #2 contract setup, but you'd also have to write MotK differently and make reference to defining the MotK hero's threat cost (and not just adding a number to the starting threat). Or, rewrite step #2 somehow."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3968424","commentId":3968424,"userName":"bdavis969","timestamp":1596293767,"content":"Sappidus, as always, thank you for the explanation.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but the benefit to playing MotK in step 7 (in your hero lineup example) is that you get to draw your hand and mulligan if needed before step 7 (trying to make sure you have wizard’s pipe and/or hobbit pipe in your starting hand) and then play MotK during step 7 to play ally Bilbo and use his ability to search for another pipe. So you could start with 2 or more pipes to start round 1? If you moved MotK and hero actions like Thurindir back to step 2, then technically you are drawing their setup (or coming into play) cards before actually drawing your hand?\n\nI have asked this before, but in light of setups being in step 7, could you do The One Ring setup after the MotK setup, giving you the ability to target the MotK ally turned hero with The One Ring (Bilbo in your example)?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3968519","commentId":3968519,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1596311457,"content":"It could go either way as mentioned above and Folco is a bit confusing as he doesn't say Setup- instead it's almost a passive ability. Contract rules state \"choose one contract to put into play along with his heroes\" you immediately then fetch your MotK ally from the contract setup and then get your starting threat which you would now have two hobbit Heroes.. This does interrupt the setup in step 2 and perhaps contract setup should occur after initial heroes are placed and threat set at the end of step 2 and then Folco wouldn't reduce by one extra threat.\n\nThe One Ring rules for setup state \"This is done immediately after placing starting heroes in your play area\" thus you cannot put the One Ring on a MotK ally no matter how you do the contract timing since this setup specifically states to do it immediately where normally when actions happen simultaneously in this game the player chooses the order to resolve.\n\nAs for other setup cards that fetch certain cards from your deck-doing it in step 7 of setup instead of 2 is almost always bad because now your MotK can whiff if you drew the ally and your Grey Wanderer can fail to play you 1 cost attachment if its in your hand and now you also have to pay for it..ugh.  Setup in step 2 is the best! Your fetched card is in your hand, no worries about whiffing and the search effects of the cards with setup are doing what they were intended to do. Then in step 5 for drawing and mulliganing ignores the one fetched card since \"that player may shuffle the six cards back into his or her deck and draw another set of six cards\". The set of six cards excludes the one fetched card.\n\nIt all makes the most sense and Contract setup should not be in step 7 of setup!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306124-timing-of-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3969005","commentId":3969005,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1596398411,"content":"Does anyone else wish guarded cards should just work with grey wanderer and not trigger guarded?
