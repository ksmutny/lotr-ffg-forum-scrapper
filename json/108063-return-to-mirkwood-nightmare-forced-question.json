For the Followed by Night treachery, yes you are still carrying out the effect, even though no enemies attack.

The \"must either\" means you get to choose, but the one you do choose, you must do everything it says (or at least try to).\n\n \n\nIf this was not the case, then they would inverse the wording on it: Forced: At the beginning of the quest phase, the player who is guarding Gollum must resolve the \"when revealed\" effect of the topmost Tantrum card in the encounter discard pile or exhaust a hero he controls.\n\n \n\nBut it uses the key \"must either\" which entails a choice.\n\n \n\nWhat if you were not able to exhaust a hero at the beginning of the quest phase because you did something else with them already, and there were no Tantrum cards in the discard pile?

That is the way I have been playing it. Otherwise, exhausting a hero is really nasty at the beginning of the quest and makes this nightmare even more \"nighmare-ish\". Just wanted to follow the ruling on this one, since the FAQ addresses it.\n\nSo the answer to his/her question is no, you cannot choose the second option because there are no tantrum cards in the discard pile, therefore you cannot resolve the \"when revealed\" effect on the top tantrum card of the discard pile. It could happen that neither effect could resolve, if there is no ready hero and no tantrum card in the discard pile, in which case the effect would do nothing. If both could resolve (i.e. there is a ready hero and a tantrum card in the discard) then the players can choose, because of the wording \"must either\". If it said \"must ... or ...\" you are not able to choose and must execute the first option unless it cannot be resolved, in which case you would resolve the second option.\n \nThe other card in question is only different because of the wording in the execution of the options since \"all\" can be zero.\n \nThis does bring up a question though. What if the wording was \"each ally\" and there are no allies, can you choose that option, or \"each ready hero\" and there are no ready heroes?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/?do=findComment&comment=2415184","commentId":2415184,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1473931768,"content":"Yep your summation is spot on.\nA really good modern example of this is the following location card:\nAltar-of-Midwinter.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Dread-Realm/Altar-of-Midwinter.jpg]\n \nIt is worded \"MUST EITHER\" so you have a choice (as opposed to if it simpy said MUST X OR Y without \"either\") but you have to resolve one of the effects fully so if you do not have a player deck left you cannot reanimate the top card of it and must instead reveal an encounter card. You will always be able to reveal an encounter card however as this effect occurs during the staging step which is part of the quest phase and the encounter deck is always replenished if it runs out during the quest phase. If the card read the first player must reanimate the top card of his deck or reveal an encounter card then you would always reanimate the top card of your deck and would only instead reveal an encounter card if you are not able to reanimate the top card of your deck because you do not have a deck left.\n\nHmmmm your new question is a tough one. I don't think each can count as zero quite like all can...\n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1171544/mustor-and-quest-1b [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1171544/mustor-and-quest-1b]\nThe text on \"The Ambush\" Quest Card for Blood of Gondor received errata so that the language was corrected and players can actually choose between the two effects as intended. You must still fully resolve one of the effects however and it doesn't seem right to be able to resolve the first effect and turn \"each\" hidden card faceup if you do not have any.... and should therefore have to take a hidden card instead.\nSo I imagine in another situation if a card gave you a choice between dealing damage to each ally in play you could not choose this if there were no allies in play.\n \n\nThis is purely a guess however!\n\nAlso jeez this is an old post.. I am quite embarrassed to read the nastiness I took part in... very glad there are pretty much never threads like this one anymore :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nEdited September 15, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/?do=findComment&comment=2417116","commentId":2417116,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1474032289,"content":"This quest, in nightmare mode and 100 % solo, is one if the hardest quest of the game."}]}
