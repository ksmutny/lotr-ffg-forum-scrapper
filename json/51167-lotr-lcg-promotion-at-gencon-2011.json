LOTR: LCG is a young game and I think that's important to do some marketing and promotion in well-known events like GenCon.\n\nYes, we know that in that event people had the chance to play a new exclusive scenario (it will be in PoD) and test the new adventure pack, but still...\n\nMaybe next year it will be more played, maybe FFG will create a tournament mode comparing session scores. I still have faith on this game, although it concerns me (just a bit) the lack of promotion it had at GenCon 2011...\n\nIt'd be great to know from people at GenCon (maybe FFG staff) if LOTR: LCG went well (in terms of people playing the game and expectations). I have read some thoughts at BGG, but they are more card reviews than anything!\n\nLet's see how all of this develops in the next months! No need to worry I guess!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51167-lotr-lcg-promotion-at-gencon-2011/?do=findComment&comment=510724","commentId":510724,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1312779086,"content":"As far as I understand LotR LCG is selling very well, so FFG maybe decided to feature Products in their video(s) that either need a bit of an advertisement boost or new games which will be published in the next couple of months???"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51167-lotr-lcg-promotion-at-gencon-2011/?do=findComment&comment=510737","commentId":510737,"userName":"Jekzer","timestamp":1312780791,"content":"Yes, I heard the same (do you know of a web that registers these kind of sells?). And I feel the same, games like Elder Sign, new Star Wars games (both board and LCG) or Gears of War: The Board Game need some love now that they hit/are going to hit stores.\n\nHowever, \"older games\" in the LCG line such as Game of Thrones (very popular in a competitive environment), Warhammer: Invasion and Call of Cthulhu had their moment of \"shininess\" even in the GenCon video recaps. Plus Star Wars LCG (which I am quite interested), being the new LCG jewel as it is.\n\nI know that competitive gameplay can appeal more than the cooperative (hence the sheer amount of AGoT, W:I tournaments) but even though I found a bit strange less promotion in a new game like LOTR: LCG (I think it hit stores in early 2011? So it is quite new).\n\nI am surprised only by the fact that GenCon 2011 didn't put LOTR in first line. Well, at least that's what I perceive from the outside (I couldn't go to GenCon, a bit far for me :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]).\n\nBut as I told before, it is still too soon to be afraid of. I have faith that FFG has a great planning from this game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51167-lotr-lcg-promotion-at-gencon-2011/?do=findComment&comment=510743","commentId":510743,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1312782917,"content":"Further, the new expansion was released without even a main page announcement. All we had was an update in the \"store\" section to indicate it was now \"in stock\".

I wouldnt be surprised if only one product manager is left assigned to LotR at the moment (who is most prolly responsible for other game lines as well)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51167-lotr-lcg-promotion-at-gencon-2011/?do=findComment&comment=510753","commentId":510753,"userName":"Jekzer","timestamp":1312784747,"content":"What you two are saying could be true. Well, maybe they haven't announced CaC yet because in Europe it hasn't hit the stores in most of the countries that normally receive the expansions. But as SiCK_Boy stated, FFG normally makes pre-previews, previews and \"now in store!\" announcements days (or weeks) before.\n\nSo staff movement to other games could be the best answer to this. If it is, I hope that it won't be permanent!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51167-lotr-lcg-promotion-at-gencon-2011/?do=findComment&comment=510767","commentId":510767,"userName":"njr5","timestamp":1312787581,"content":"I would just like to echo the comments above, it is VERY disappointing that ZERO time was spent on LOTR :LCG. As a new game and with its recent issues surrounding shipping dates i would have expected at least a mention and quick pan over people trying the Print on Demand expansion.\n\nIt looks to me like FFG have abandoned this game in favour of their new toys DUST and Star Wars, the lack of marketing and news announcements, the minimal effort initially on the FAQ document, the delays in shipping could so easily be because they prioritised other products.\n\nIt is very telling as well that the concerns raised repeatedly here and at prominent gamer websites such as BGG that a \"completion pack\" that adds the missing duplicate cards so players could have 3 x each player card without purchasing multiple base games and adding cards to their collection that are essentially useless (i.e multiple quest cards and encounter sets). PS i bought 2 x base set.\n\nNow i know the above comes across very negative, but dont get me wrong i think this game is GREAT and the fact it scales from solo play to group is brilliant, i like the duality of quest/encounter vs player deck and can see so many oppurtunities for FFG to expand the game and include such things as Moria, Smaug, Mumaks,maiir etc.\n\nHeres hoping that FFG return from the convention take note of our concerns and correct the situation, if note the chances of me buying into future FFG LCG's like star wars reduces due to my lack of faith in them supporting the endevour.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51167-lotr-lcg-promotion-at-gencon-2011/?do=findComment&comment=510845","commentId":510845,"userName":"Bootylactin","timestamp":1312796597,"content":"Some quick thoughts from someone who attended GenCon...\n\nThey had 3 demo tables set up for LotR, and they were always full.  There was a banner in that area that was as large as any of their other game banners.  I can also tell you that all of their stock for Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at Carrock was sold out by Saturday morning.  It may have sold out Friday, but I only noticed the empty shelf space Saturday.\n\nAs far as promotion AT THE CON, it was as heavily promoted as any of their other games, in terms of visibility and demo tables."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51167-lotr-lcg-promotion-at-gencon-2011/?do=findComment&comment=510907","commentId":510907,"userName":"Jekzer","timestamp":1312800989,"content":"Bootylactin said:\n\nSome quick thoughts from someone who attended GenCon...\n\nThey had 3 demo tables set up for LotR, and they were always full.  There was a banner in that area that was as large as any of their other game banners.  I can also tell you that all of their stock for Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at Carrock was sold out by Saturday morning.  It may have sold out Friday, but I only noticed the empty shelf space Saturday.\n\nAs far as promotion AT THE CON, it was as heavily promoted as any of their other games, in terms of visibility and demo tables.\n\n\n\n \n\nWell that's a thing that I wanted to hear !
