Peril in Pelargir has always been brutal for me. I played it maybe 10-12 times and I think I only won 2 games. Generally, I do not really mind losing. Loosing a lot is a part of LotR LCG. But there is something absolutely frustrating about this quest. Perhaps that constant, tedious flood of thugs. I cannot really say why, but I feel more irritated than truly challenged.\n\n \n\nI am glad I did eventually win. It is now done and I have no desire to play the quest again. It is absolutely my least favorite of all the quests, even though there are harder ones now (not even counting the NM mode). Maybe one day I will come back to it, perhaps with some broken infinite-loop overkill combo deck, just to make the encounter deck suffer my retribution.\n\n \n\nAlso, the theme of Peril in Pelargir does not help. I have just went through Mirkwood, Caradhras ad Moria, but a bunch of drunk thugs is too much for my posse? I eat Trolls for breakfast and have just kicked Balrog's bum, so why make me lose repeatedly to some port tavern punters. It only adds to my irritation. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125200-welcoming-the-heirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=1305217","commentId":1305217,"userName":"awp832","timestamp":1413807426,"content":"The Against the Shadow cycle in particular is incredibly difficult.  You won't find Into Ithilien or Siege of Cair Andros any easier, and many of the packs have tough quests as well.   I think that the designers assume that you bought everything in order and with increased card pool wanted to increase the challenge after Khazad-Dum.  \n\n \n\nThe may have gone a little overboard,  many of these quests are the hardest in the game,  decks that crush Journey Down the Anduin and even the dangerous Escape from Dol Guldur are still going to have real problems against the Heirs of Numenor box and beyond.\n\n \n\nAlthough if it helps, the Ring Maker Cycle is easier, IMO.  Some difficult quests in there too, to be sure,  but in general I think they realized they may have been a little harsh with the difficulty setting in HoN, and toned it down just a hair for Voice of Isengard. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125200-welcoming-the-heirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=1305221","commentId":1305221,"userName":"asmeus","timestamp":1413807975,"content":"Well HoN is hard, but it was huge satisfaction when I finally beat all scenarios 2 player with my self made decks and strategy.\n\n \n\nAwesome cycle - theme, difficulty, e.t.c.\n\nSeveral scenarios that are fun to play 3-4 player.

Still, I think I need to find a way to have some more allies fielded on round one: my spirit / lore deck is a little low on allies, and the tactics / leadership deck requires a couple of rounds to become effective.

FFG, geniuses of evil.\n\n \n\nComing back to vanilla HoN, I do not know what is it about those quest that they score so much on the frustration scale. The difficulty is one thing, but it is not only that, as there is plenty of difficult scenarios that are better received by the general LotR LCG public. I am having hard time grasping the reasons for my personal hatred. So what is it you feel?

I am rather poor at building decks, so take my comments as you will. But I could not imagine getting through HoN with the same decks that I had made for earlier cycles. I pretty much sailed through Mirkwood + Khazad-Dum with my two or three rotating decks. But then all got smashed by HoN. And I mean massacred, until I switched to some specific tactics heavy deck (if I remember correctly, Boromir became my MVP).\n \nAs for Gandalf, he feels absolutely fantastic in solo plays. An obvious very strong pairing with Elrond. Gandalf effectively mitigates the luck factor of playing cards with Vilya, while not sacrificing anything but initial threat. Not to mention his great stats. I cannot say about multiplayer, but in solo Gandalf/Elrond deck is tons of fun to play. You get to manipulate your deck, do some fun tricks, lots of draw, and it opens up many options. Gandalf and his attachments create some breathing room when it comes to playing your cards, which in turn refreshes and streamlines the play. I feel he creates more freedom and loosens up the game a bit where perhaps it felt a bit too limiting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125200-welcoming-the-heirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=1311416","commentId":1311416,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1414244521,"content":"SPOILER ALERT:SPOILER ALERT:SPOILER ALERT:SPOILER ALERT:SPOILER ALERT:SPOILER SPOILER ALERT:SPOILER ALERT:SPOILER ALERT:SPOILER ALERT:\n\n \n\nI don't find Peril in Pelargir that hard at all.
