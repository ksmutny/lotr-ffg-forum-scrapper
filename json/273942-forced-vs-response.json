Or she can trigger the steed before discarding it?\n\nAt no point after the Orc Raiders revealed from the deck player can use events like Hand Upon the Bow or Galadhrim's Greeting to avoid this?\n\nEdited April 20, 2018 by DarkPhoenix"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273942-forced-vs-response/?do=findComment&comment=3291580","commentId":3291580,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1524224561,"content":"Encounter effects alway do their effect before players actions. That is the rule.\n\nSo when the engagement is made (no matter if you engage intentionally the enemy or not) you have to make the forced before the response. No readying effects for beravor this day. There is some response that cancel an action, only them can be done before the resolution of an encounter effect.\n\nSame things for Orc raiders. The when revealed first must be resolved before doing an action."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273942-forced-vs-response/?do=findComment&comment=3291686","commentId":3291686,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1524231669,"content":"The Steed would be discarded before you could use its response."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273942-forced-vs-response/?do=findComment&comment=3298355","commentId":3298355,"userName":"DarkPhoenix","timestamp":1524741251,"content":"Thanks!"}]}
