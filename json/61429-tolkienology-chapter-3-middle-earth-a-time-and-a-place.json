Firstly I would like to thank all the support I have received from those who have been following my writings. Secondly I would like to announce that I have created a site specifically for publishing these ‘ramblings’ as it were, so that people interested have another place to read them outside this forum. Here is the link TOLKIENOLOGY.WEEBLY.COM [http://www.tolkienology.weebly.com] I hope you like it. You can also subscribe to the feed, so you can get an update via email.\n\nLast chapter we looked at the mysteries of Tolkien’s writings, and I was reminded that even though I had touched on some pretty in depth material, I hadn’t yet done a chapter on the basics.\n\nSo without further ado……\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhere better to start than the beginning? It’s a safe bet everyone reading this will have heard of Middle Earth, however the professor seemed to have a lot of confusion regarding his choice of words. What exactly does ‘middle earth’ mean?\n\nTolkien actually didn’t create the term middle earth, it comes from the word middle erd, which in itself comes from the word middangeard, the name of the inhabited lands of men between the seas. It also bears resemblance to the norse word midgard, the world of living between heaven and hell.\n\nThe confusion arises that many people think that middle earth is a fantasy world created by Tolkien, in which he places his dragons, balrogs, elves and so on. This is in fact incorrect and middle earth is our world in which we sit today.\n\nSounds crazy doesn’t it? But no, Middle Earth is not a planet in a galaxy far far away (sorry couldn’t resist), but to use that last famous line as reference, what it is, is a long time ago.\n\nTolkien specifically stated that he didn’t think himself as writing fantasy. What he called it was mythopoeia-creating myths inside our own earth.\n\nAnd indeed, taking this new fact, if Middle Earth is our earth, then the only fantasy that Tolkien ever created was the pre-history timeline.\n\nTo put this clearer, everything that happened in Middle Earth- Melkor, Sauron, the rings, Frodo, Gondor, Elves, hobbits, happened in our earth, just a very long time ago. How long ago? Well……(these are according to my sources- from books and other websites- not editable wikis, though if you have other numbers that are backed up id like to hear them, as ive known authors to be wrong before on dates.)\n\nFrom the creation of the world, known as Arda (which includes middle earth and the undying lands)-to the events of the war of the ring, there is approximately a gap of 37 000 years. After the events of the trilogy finish and the 4th age starts, there is a gap of around 6000 years until Tolkiens’s time- ie the 20th century. This would place the war of the ring around 4000bc in our years, and the creation of Arda around 41 000 bc.\n\nSo if middle earth is our earth, then where would all of Tolkien's locations be now placed on a map? Well, if you look at a map of middle earth, it loosely represents the area of north western Europe. We know that Tolkien based his inspiration for The Shire on the Midlands of England, placing Bag End near Birmingham. Also Rivendell is sometimes loosely associated with Oxford. Gondor can be seen as Italy, and in some places- The Roman Empire (the splitting of the roman empire into Rome/Constantinople looks alot like the north/south realms of Arnor/Gondor), and Rohan can be seen as the various Germanic tribes. Mordor can be seen as the Black Sea and the lands about. (it would also put the colder north farthing of the shire around the lake district which is where I’m at….yeah gotta love being in the shire :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])\n\nOf course there is a glaring problem here with matching locations on our maps, to locations on a middle earth map. They obviously can't be transposed directly. If Bag End is Birmingham, then id challenge anyone to travel due east for about 300 miles to get to oxford, and they’d most likely end up in the North Sea. But we must remember that Tolkien is not saying these places are their earth counterparts. They are more based on them. Tolkien himself states that it would be pointless looking for geological references as the days of the third age are long past, and the lands much changed. Here Tolkien is of course referring to the world's geological change from one super continent to those we know today.\n\nTaking this we can say for certain that Tolkien is not trying to be geologically correct, as the shape of middle earth of course could not possibly change to our continents in a mere 6000 years. Here Tolkien is speeding up continental shift by many thousands of years.\n\nSo it can be said that Tolkien's creations are more of an 'alternate reality' or to be more precise, an 'alternate timeline,' as we actually know in our reality what was happening 6000 years ago, however according to Tolkien it is much different. Not to mention us having proof that the world is much older than the 43 000 years Tolkien is proposing. Also none of the places that we encounter in the hobbit, or the trilogy, or the silmarillion, existed in the same time as their counterparts- they couldn’t possibly have- we already know that 6000 years ago none of the places that Tolkien uses as inspiration would have existed.\n\nIf we look at the writings of Tolkien in this new light, then we only begin to see how clever he really was. For instance, take the downfall and sinking of the island of Numenor in the 2nd age. It has always been clear that the inspiration for this was of course the legend of Atlantis. But seeing as everything that happened in middle earth happened in our earth, then Tolkien is in fact saying that Numenor was Atlantis. It is Numenor that in fact fuelled that legend that we call Atlantis today, not the other way round.\n\nOther examples are the Barrow Wights. The Barrows in England did not inspire Tolkien to write such material. The Barrow’s creators thousands of years ago were actually inspired by true events that happened many thousands of years before that. The same can be applied to almost every part of what was previously called Tolkien’s sources of ‘inspiration.’ This is how mythopoeia works.\n\nSo we can see here how Tolkien really pushed the boundaries of making his works ‘realistic.’ Not many writers after him (I can’t think of many, can you?) have made such a bold claim as to state their creations were the pre-history of our own earth.\n\nOk that’s it for this chapter. Next chapter I intend to look at goblins, orcs, half orcs, goblin men, uruk hai, snaga, and the confusion that is sometimes concerned with them., and if I can manage to physically write it, the icky sticky topic on how do orcs reproduce.\n\nPeace\n\nRich\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61429-tolkienology-chapter-3-middle-earth-a-time-and-a-place/?do=findComment&comment=602162","commentId":602162,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1330919515,"content":"Thanks for Chapter 3!  I've visited your new site and subscribed to the RSS feed there so that I won't miss any new items :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61429-tolkienology-chapter-3-middle-earth-a-time-and-a-place/?do=findComment&comment=602164","commentId":602164,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1330919657,"content":"thanks alot\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61429-tolkienology-chapter-3-middle-earth-a-time-and-a-place/?do=findComment&comment=602192","commentId":602192,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1330925906,"content":"RSS'ed!\n\n \n\n--\n\n \n\nHey, Rich.\n\n\nI read something (in my native language) that disturbed me a lot and which I think you could expand a little bit:\nJ.

While Martin's work is full of political intrigues, deception and people trying to seize the most disputed power over a divided and broken empire, Tolkien is more of a mythological work. Thus, two very different environements : Martin's heroes are versatile people, there is no 'right' or 'wrong', no 'good' or 'bad' people. The environement here is quite 'realistic' ; Tolkien's heroes evolve in a manichean world. Two sides : the 'free people' against the 'evil Mordor'. It is so since it's a mythological and epic world.\n\nIn 'A Song of Ice and Fire', there's a lot of various political, cultural or military  events that formed the main plot. In 'The Lord of the Rings', there is one main event, although a lot of other important events are said to happen at the same time. That's why, if one don't take this writing contest into consideration, one could think nothing important happens in Middle-Earth."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61429-tolkienology-chapter-3-middle-earth-a-time-and-a-place/?do=findComment&comment=602262","commentId":602262,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1330940487,"content":"There are guys like Stephen King who wish they had done the same Tolkien did, putting everything in one \"world\" so to speak.

But it's very confusing.\n\nThere's the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, 12 volumes of The History of Middle Earth, something called Lost Tales, the Children of Hurin and then song or poem books like The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Bilbo's Last Song and maybe others?\n\nThe other confusing part is that then it seems like there is a bunch of cross-over, where some of this stuff is in the Silmarillion I think or in the Histories like Lost Tales, and then there's chapters in the Silmarillion for stuff like Children of Hurin?

(unless we're talking Morgoth stories) and the world of middle earth is all the more beautiful for it. when we travel with the hobbits, and then the fellowship, it is so much more personal that we dont see many people. and remember they are going through the wilds in secret  which the author fails to mention. also he states that bag end to mordor is 400 miles??? wrong. it is about 300 miles from bag end to rivendell.then the journey has to go from rivedell to caradhras, then to hollin, then through moria- 40 miles in itself, then lorien, down the great river, over emyn muil, dead marshes, to the black gate, down into ithillien, to minas morgul, up to cirith ungol, THEN you get into mordor. so yes, it is much more, even as the nazgul flies, but the journey winds its way through mountains and forests and rivers, on a path that certainly isnt direct.\n\nthe author is stating LOTR's faults is that what happens in the entire trilogy, happens in about a chapter other books- that to me is a good point. it gets tiresome to have too many sub plots- take aragorn and eowyn- that little romance thing is a sub plot- but it doesnt interfere with the main book. i ve read fantasy books that have romantic sub plots which makes you feel like you're reading softcore pornography.\n\nphew.....sorry, got worked up.....ive really got to go and calm down after that last statement...anyways....\n\nthe author states there are no internetal conflicts...apart from..gollum/smeagol and boromir.......well these two are the best examples of a split personality /internal struggle i can think of. also the fellowship are torn about where to go....follow frodo? go to claim the throne? go and help your own nations?\n\nfinally the author ends with the point the basically says tolkien rambles on and says 1 sentence in a paragraph. again his style, but i think more importantly, LOTR was written decades before any martin work.\n\nnow of course i am being biased here..how can i not be? i love tolkiens work. however i think it remains that my points are valid. i have not read any of martins work, i am sure they are amazing and his success shows that, however i can probably say with 99% certainty that alot of it will have been inspired by tolkien, as is just about every fantasy writer of the 20/21st century. i mean even stephen king based his dark tower series on LOTR- just with the 'king twist'\n\nso no, i do not think LOTR is slow, boring, empty, rambling (you want rambling? this is rambling :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) however i guess everyone is entitled to their opinion\n\nin a world filled with new books trying to break the 'cliche fantasy' (and we know tolkien didnt technically write fantasy) it is refreshing to have a good old fashion adventure- and that is my honest opinion-besides who set that 'cliche'? tolkien did....theres a reason its timeless\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61429-tolkienology-chapter-3-middle-earth-a-time-and-a-place/?do=findComment&comment=602325","commentId":602325,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1330949518,"content":"Mattr0polis said:\n\n \n\nThanks, richsabre.\n\nOk, so if I'm interested in reading just the 'canon' materials then I can just read:\n\n-The Hobbit\n\n-The Lord of the Rings trilogy\n\n-The Silmarillion\n\n-The Children of Hurin\n\n-Unfinished Tales(??)\n\n-Adventures of Tom Bombadil/Bilbo's Last Song\n\n \n\nIs that everything?\n\nIt sounds like I can skip the Histories if they are old drafts and analysis but even the Lost Tales ones?

Assuming the books and the events in them are anything similar to the tv show.\n\nGod, I didn't think you could make fantasy bland and boring, but the show succeeds with flying colors. First five episodes were all yadda-yadda-yadda-yawn. It was just like I thought about them (and my friend said out loud) after the first couple of episode, medieval Bold and the Beautiful. There was arguably even nothing fantasy about it, just plain medieval nobles plotting and inbreeding."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61429-tolkienology-chapter-3-middle-earth-a-time-and-a-place/?do=findComment&comment=602773","commentId":602773,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1331027913,"content":"I love the A Song of Ice and Fire series, about equally as I do The Lord of the Rings.

Last year i bought the Silmarillion on audio tape to listen in my postvan and it was a lot clearer to me, so i may give the book another go this year. At the moment im in the middle of the trilogy again and it hasnt lost any of its magic from 25 years ago!! Eomer is presently slaughtering the orcs on the border of Fangorn! Lovely!!!
