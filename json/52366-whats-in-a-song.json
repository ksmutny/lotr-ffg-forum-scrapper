It does NOT generate an extra resource per turn. Each hero is given one resource per turn, and this isn't related to the icons, it's just part of the first phase of the turn.\n\nThey're great for multi-sphere decks I think. I can't wait until they release all 4 types. You can then put together a multi-sphere deck and have enough resources to play whatever."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52366-whats-in-a-song/?do=findComment&comment=521654","commentId":521654,"userName":"The Strolling Bones","timestamp":1314635219,"content":"This is what I thought but I wanted to run it by the community just in case. ****, my friends are going to see the game get that much more difficult.\n\nThanks everybody"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52366-whats-in-a-song/?do=findComment&comment=521752","commentId":521752,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1314649007,"content":"The Strolling Bones said:\n\nThis is what I thought but I wanted to run it by the community just in case. ****, my friends are going to see the game get that much more difficult.\n\nThanks everybody\n\n\n\nThey'll be thankful for it in the long run,"}]}
