It was actually more likely a single player would get more than one, each providing further advantage.  Ultimately I had to remove them from the card pool for balancing.  \n\nEdited February 25, 2016 by Slothgodfather"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194058-searching-for-alternate-art-gimli/?do=findComment&comment=2071534","commentId":2071534,"userName":"Jacob5432","timestamp":1456432491,"content":"> The idea is they pretty much have to give out exclusives at these events and alternate art cards are the way to go, since they're not altering the game or adding to the card pool, just making your heroes look fancy.\n\nWell, the Gen Con attendants do get to play the released POD expansion six months earlier than anybody else.
