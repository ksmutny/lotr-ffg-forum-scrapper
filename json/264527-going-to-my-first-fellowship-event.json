I sometime get the occasion to know my partner in advance so I can discuss what we are going to play. Some other time I can even choose my partner.\n\nI have seen a lot of different things on the fellowship. A long time ago I see more competitive spirit, and a lot of decks look the same, now I see all kind of decks played, from the top ones to the strange \"one hero Gandalf\" who doesn't do a lot, but who is still well accepted by the community. So, no matter what you intent to play it will gonna be cool. If you have a deck that you really like you must take it.\n\nIf you want to have a good deck  I suggest you to build a polyvalent deck. Playing a fight deck on a fellowship is really dangerous because if you are paired with another fights decks you don't stand any chance to win. Be able to quest and have some test of will is good. Even better if you can also have some heal (warden of healing). Another advice could be that people don't enjoy doomed cards or Gandalf hero (because they can't play ally version) but I personally play them anyway ^^"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264527-going-to-my-first-fellowship-event/?do=findComment&comment=3107771","commentId":3107771,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1512347778,"content":"I always make sure to have a deck like this on stand-by.

We much preferred Eowyn against this quest because of her ability to add just a little more willpower when we were coming up close to being able to make enough progress."}]}
