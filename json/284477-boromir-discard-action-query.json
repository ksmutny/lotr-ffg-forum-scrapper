The attacker is destroyed.  I assume this means there is no damage to apply?\n\n2. The attacker is not destroyed. Does this mean that the attack is considered undefended (as Boromir has shuffled off this mortal coil), and the damage is applied to another Hero?\n\nI've done a very quick search and didn't find an answer, tho' I'm sure it would have been asked before."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284477-boromir-discard-action-query/?do=findComment&comment=3502206","commentId":3502206,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1539431435,"content":"Yes to both."}]}
