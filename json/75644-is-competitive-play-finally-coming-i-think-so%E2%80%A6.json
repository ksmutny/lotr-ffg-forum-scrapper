Cardboard of the Rings Ep. 36 addressed the matter of competitive play very well, IMO. If there were a good system it would have already appeared. Why turn a co-op game into something adversarial? Then we end up with some veteran players who intentionally screw new players, etc. like in MTG and other games, keeping the player pool smaller. I'd rather see some sort of EXP or Badge system emerge. Maybe it's hokey, but I don't think that turning this co-op/solo game competitve will go well.\n\nNow I'll sit back and wait to be attacked."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75644-is-competitive-play-finally-coming-i-think-so%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=734403","commentId":734403,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1355579124,"content":"perhaps….but i will agree with john here, and not just because im a solo player….\n\nmore of the players out there play exclusively solo over any other type of play (see my play poll [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=694006]), so i dont think it would be a success\n\nnow of course the idea is 'optional', but if ffg are releasing content that a large amount of players arent going to buy i dont think its a good idea.\n\nits worth remembering that although the US has a large player base on this forum and others, other countries arent so lucky. theres about 10 or less UK players here, and this makes the chances of finding competitors in your area very slim indeed. i certainly know no one in the whole of northern england on this forum. ive never seen any of the cards in any stores in a 100 miles radius (not that there are any) so events are pretty much out of it\n\nso..if it aint broke….(make it better??)….or leave it.\n\nrich\n\nPS. just seen it was a reference to a rules sheet and not any other content. surely ffg will have to make dedicated content? so re-reading the OP its basically just a mod to the original rules.\n\ndoesnt seem worth it to me….."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75644-is-competitive-play-finally-coming-i-think-so%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=734412","commentId":734412,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1355581805,"content":"I completely love the cooperative spirit of this game. That being said, I also think it would be fun (and appeal to a certain population) to have a competitive structure to participate in. This doesn't mean the game's changing in anyway, we're just comparing scores or some other aspect of play to eachother to win a prize. I think this will work because it's already built into the system and people are doing it naturally anyway (look at all the tournaments on the community page…).
