This is why enemies and locations with Victory: X \"just work\" and do not require further text about where to put them when they leave play.\n\n \n\nMy intent was to change the card as little as possible.

However, I definitely agree that the card as-is lacks a compelling reason to be included in any deck. Even if it only cost 1, which would be too low from a balance standpoint, I would rather include Westfold Horse-breeder or Silvan Refugee for the same cost. Chump blockers are just more useful than attachments (with basically equivalent value) in 9 of 10 situations. The fact that Spirit has cards like Unexpected Courage, Arwen, and a host of excellent Rohan allies, all at 2 cost, just dooms this card to mediocrity. Heck even Stand and Fight is much better than this card, in the sense that you can get an additional use of a 1 or 2 cost ally, as an action.\n\nEdited July 1, 2014 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1140246","commentId":1140246,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1404248593,"content":"From Rulebook:\n\n \n\nSome enemy and location cards award victory points\nwhen they are defeated.

Almost anyone can tell you if a card is \"powerful\", but only the skilled deckbuilders can direct and balance that power appropriately. \n\n \n\nTherefore, if there was a game where every card was about the same power level, there would still be differentiation between skilled and non-skilled deck builders, because the skilled deck builder looks at all the things mentioned above, not just how powerful a card is in it's own vacuum. \n\n \n\nWhat's my point? Favor of the lady is a pretty mediocre card not only because of its lack of obvious power, but because of it's lack of synergy with other cards and because of that, without knowing future cards, it doesn't really deserve a card slot at it's current power level. I could be wrong, maybe a deckbuilder more skilled than I could find a deck where this is the best card to take up 1-3 slots for that deck, but I very much doubt it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1140595","commentId":1140595,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1404274935,"content":"I'd add restricted to a ton of cards.

The other examples, yes, i care if you agree or not =]\n\n \n\nDunedain Cache: Cost 1.\n\n \n\nI never saw this attachment in any deck, even online.\n\n \n\nDwalin: After Dwalin attacks and destroys an enemy, lower your threat by 1.\n\n \n\nHate that he is only used against some decks. Heroes should be generic and this Dwalin above would be awesome to play with.\n\n \n\nGlorfindel (lore): Remove \"once per round\".\n\n \n\nHe cost A LOT, so his ability should be worth to put on the table, like Elrond. Maybe this help (probable not).\n\n \n\nBilbo: Draws 1 additional card in the resource phase.\n\n \n\nWhen I play him, I am the person that want to draw more! This is personal taste.\n\n \n\nMirlond: Each hero you control gets -1 threat cost.\n\n \n\nSo she can see more play. Another personal taste.\n\n \n\nPippin (spirit): Remove \"If each hero you control has the Hobbit trait, Pippin gains:\"\n\n \n\nPippin lore is so much better and this requirement make him too much specialized to hobbit decks. I would also change his name to some less know hobbit, so he can pair up with the other Pippin and increase the hobbit deck possibilities. If you also make that the enemy can't engage anymore (like some people wrongly think him works), he would be a REALLY good deck for some decks and see more play. Maybe making Dunhere decks more viable against harder quests.\n\n \n\nThalin is playable, but I hate to put his 1 WP to quest. I would remove -1 def to +1 wp. Maybe this make him OP, but right now staging sniping is not really a good deck for most quests.\n\n \n\nBrand is playable, but overshadowed by legolas that is REALLY good, so I never see him played. Make +1 HP, -1 Def, helps him, so that he can quest and be better at soaking undefended attacks and suffering through treachery cards. Also could be -1 def, -1 threat. Bard suffer the same fate of Brand, but less so. Personal taste.\n\n \n\nTheoden is really underwhelming, but playable. If solo, he gives +1 WP to another hero (cos generally at least one hero will stay ready to atk/def, seeing that he works with tactics). In Multiplayer, he can be quite good, but not really cos most tactics heroes don't want to quest. So maybe +2, +3 in the best case scenario. Remember that the self +1 WP is already in his threat cost. My opinion is that he should give +1 to every tactic or rohan and don't care for printed, making song of battle a little better. Personal taste.\n\n \n\nAncient Mathon: \"you draws 3 cards\".

As I read him, the receiving player moves a resource to the player that sends the trader. Then, if that Trader wants to move again, whoever receives it must move a resource from their resources. So doesn't the Trader (even with 3 in play) just move resources individually between players. So if one player has, say, 10 resources, at most they can only move 1 from their pile to another player per Blue Mountain Trader in play? Since the Trader is discarded if now resources are moved, you have to essentially negate the effect to get the Trader back in position to shuttle a resource.\n\n \n\nSorry, that is garbled, but I'm concerned that everyone is reading something into the Trader that I can't see! The Wandering Took at least combo'ed Song of Earindel to allow a slow reduction in threat, whereas the Trader can't combo (as we've seen, the Harbour Master doesn't work).\n\n \n\nI suppose one way to put it is:\n\nOne player is resource rich, the other plays Spirit.\n\nSpirit player sends all three Traders over, and gains three resources.\n\nIn order to repeat the trick, the resource rich player must send the Traders back, and gain three resources in the process.\n\nOverall, no gain to either player.\n\n \n\nI can see that in specific circumstances the ability to shunt a resource over temporarily is useful, but I feel like the hyperbole that's being spoken about Blue Mountain Trader somehow allowing free reorganisation of resources is a bit OTT. He's not much better than some old resource moving effects. Frankly, Errand Rider is quite a bit better in many ways (cheaper, fits the sphere for most resource gaining effects, simple to use, very repeatable).\n\n \n\nOK, that was a long post.

But I should say that I wasn't competing for points or anything with regard to Errand Rider, I genuinely didn't really see the power of the Trader. I can see how he works a bit more now, which is helpful - there is still a degree of hyperbole about his power, since overall one Trader can only move 1 resource between players, but it's much more clear how he allows re-organisation within each individual player's characters. Perhaps some change is needed, and certainly a requirement to exhaust is the obvious one. Food for thought then."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1144487","commentId":1144487,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1404577102,"content":"Exhaust would be too harsh for a 2-cost ally.

If you look at hearthstone, they do a lot of errata, making some cards stronger, some weaker. A lot of times. Why? Because they make mistakes, because they don't really know the game before people play then too long, they sometimes are too cautious when creating cards, they can overlook some cards (as you can see with the Blue Mountain Trader). I saw the interview with one of the Star Wards Devs that he said that if he could change some cards, he would, but because doing so is horrible for the players (because what they see on the cards does not correspond) they shy away of correcting it and keep the faq to a minimum, only doing corrections for misworded or broken cards. I understand why they do that.\n\n \n\nMy problem is having a lot of useless cardboard around, but those cards could be awesome (and fun) with a little push. That's why I find this discussion interesting.

It is much better than Grim Resolve and We Do Not Sleep. I think each Ready All should be different from one another, So I would make it cost 2 and Dwarfs don't need to ready to defend and also give dwarfs the text from Stand Together. What do you think? The problem is that this is against my philosophy of \"The Simpler, The Better\". Personally I would make Grim Resolve cost 4 and keep Lure of Moria as is. \n \n> Unexpected Courage should be limit one per deck because its such a superior readying ability\n\n \nUnexpected Courage is fine. Just buff Stead of the Mark and we are good.\n \n> Steward of Gondor needs to cost at least 3 or even 4 because its such a huge resource engine at only 2 cost\n\n \nSame as Nerf. But it would be probably fine to cost 3.\n \n> Outlands characters could be fixed in many ways one being they only give each other outlands character a bonus and not themself or.. instead of being a passive ability they have to exhaust to give outlands characters the stat bonus.\n\n \n\nOutlands are fine.

But I kinda dislike Ethir Swordsman because he is used in other decks too in place of Silvan Refugee. I would buff silvan to have 2hp and nerf Ethir.

Also, helps secrecy, that REALLY needs help.\n\n\nLate Adventurer- this is only if you suck at planning who to quest with, give that character an extra willpower and this card might enter decks\n\nGreat idea.

I sometimes use these but I feel they need a little more, add a card draw for Wealth and make it a net gain of 2 resources for Gaining Strength\n\nGood ideas. When you compare those to steward of gondor, you see how broken is steward. Those changes make those cards great and more competitive with steward. Still, steward overshadows both options.\n\n\nDamrod- is his ability and stats worth that cost? how about an extra defense\n\nExtra def is nice. Still almost impossible to use his ability and he would be a stat only ally. I would like to make his ability more useful somehow.\n\n\nMaster of Lore- should not have been errata'd\n\nMaster is the resource acceleration for lore. But he is fragile and take 3 turns to pay for himself. I would -1 cost and +1 hp. Maybe still not good though.\n\n\nMirlonde should be printed Lore AND Silvan heroes get her discount because at max all her ability does is give you 3 less starting threat, she should also be one less starting threat herself, why not?\n\nThe first part is ok, still weak but useful. The second part, I don't like it because it violate the implicit rule of the threat cost and make the card less elegant. \n\n\nPippin Spirit should not be limited to having all Hobbit heroes and his ability should only raise your threat by 2\n\nHe is useful, the problem is the all hobbits that limit him too much. 2 threat is too low.\n\n\nDenethor Leadership ally should get -1 Willpower for each hero with 2 or more damage\n\nNot sure about this. He would be too good.\n\n\nFaramir Lore hero should have an extra ability or something that boosts his fellow faithful rangers (If Faramir has X attack, all Ranger characters you control get ????)\n\n-1 def and +1 atk would be enough.\n\n \n\n\nCaldara- her ability is to DISCARD her, give her less starting threat, 7 or even 6 and if the allies she could put into play weren't limited to Spirit.. then she would be powerful\n\nShe is very powerful, but only goes in very limited decks. I like the idea of not limiting to Spirit allies. Maybe this make her useful in a 2 Hero Spirit deck.\n\n \n\n\nTheoden- another hero from this cycle suffering with a poor ability, he should also have \"Theoden can pay for Rohan allies from any sphere\" he's the King of Rohan!! come on!\n\nYeah, this would be really nice. Compare him to Elrond and you see that he is not that broken if we do this.\n\n\nForth Eorlingas! why be limited to Rohan heroes, make it Rohan characters, there's hardly anyone left in the staging area after engagement anyways or just make it 1 cost\n\nThis one needs playtest! Not sure if one or both changes would be enough. I would go with Rohan Characters first.\n\n\nSteed of the Mark is only worth it if attached hero has 3 or more willpower (so it may get better when those heroes come), why does it have to cost? just exhaust it for it's ability\n\nIf you make this change, basically we have a new Light of Valinor for anyone. Not sure what to do though. Make it 0 cost?\n\n \n\n\nFatty Bolger- 6 starting threat since his ability raises threat and he's not that great anyways\n\nAs I said before, this violate the implicit rule of threat cost. Not sure what to do with him. His ability is really good for the end of the scenario for the last punch or when the players are going to quest unsuccessfully or something. Very situational.

I definitely agree that errata should only be used on cards that break the game or are overly powerful compared to everything else. This whole thread was what errata would you like to see and its mostly for fun because I would actually not want to see all mine or other people's errata suggestions become real because it would be way too confusing to remember what cards actually are.\n\nI still wish many cards were slightly different to be more useful but as an LCG you're simply going to have weaker and stronger cards and the freedom of deck building let's you choose your decks power level which has many benefits and yes certain weak cards you do have to build a deck around but that can be fun.\n\nAnd I must add it is nice having certain powerful cards like a dwarf swarm deck because if you really need to beat a quest its nice having the option to pull out your power deck. If all cards were equal you wouldn't be able to make those extra powerful decks or even a weaker deck for the purpose of your own fun creativity or the extra challenge.. so having a spectrum of weak and powerful cards is healthy for the game as long as they're not on the extreme ends of bad (The End Comes) or powerful (pre errata'd Erebor Battle Master).\n\nSo even though errata is only used when crucial its still fun to dream how certain cards could be better or to express why you think a card is OP which is the whole point of this thread."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1152398","commentId":1152398,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1405154900,"content":"> Anyone has sugestions for the following cards.

Recently however I've noticed this card is nice to have around to soak up treacheries or shadow effects so instead of having to discard your Gondorian Shield you can get rid of the cloak that you have no use for anymore.

If this was an online game we'd see a lot of errata on cards that didn't work quite right because it would cost the players nothing, and would only require a bit of time to fix.\n\nRealistically though, you're just not going to see an errata to make Silverlode Archer slightly better to make it cost-effective compared to Ithilian Archer. In any case the argument that Ithilian Archer is just better isn't true - only the silverlode archer has the silvan trait.\n\nThe game has been moving towards increasing the importance of trait design since release (where it was clearly always intended to be) so when you look at cards you should keep that in mind.\n\nThis is why Lure of Moria is cheaper than Grim Resolve. \n\nGrim Resolve at 5 is basically the value of \"ready all the characters available to the heroes without restriction.\"\n\nNow as it happens from a balance point of view, Dwarfs ended up being one of the most powerful traits, so a card that is limited by only targeting them isn't really limited. Dwarfs have more cards than any other trait right now. However eventually the other traits will catch up (they already are starting too) so eventually this will be a meaningful restriction on the other players you play with.\n\nIt's really hard for the community to come up with errata because of this, we have no knowledge of the future design. However I think it's fairly clear that at least some kind of design guidelines exist about the future of traits we don't yet see much of.\n\nAs a result I would argue that the only errata we as a community can really argue for are the cards that are so stupidly strong as to be a design problem (Which is why I argued for errata on Unexpected Courage) or else cards that are so systemically weak that they will never be good.\n\nPower in the Earth is often cited as an example of such a weak card. However rather than changing it there are two properties of it that we can exploit in a way that's more conducive to how card games work.\n\nFirst we could create player cards which interact with attachments on locations - Maybe discard all locations with player card attachments from play (very strong), how about a hero that gets +1 willpower for every location in the staging area with an attachment. \n\nNow, Only four player cards exist which attach to locations, and only two of them aren't restricted in some way. However Power in the Earth is the only card which attaches to locations and which you then want to leave those locations in play. (Path of Need, and Ancient Mathom both want you to make the location active, thor's key is unique, you could argue you'd leave it's locaiton in play too I guess). \n\nAn alternative is to look at the locations in the encounter deck, Power in the Earth would be worth a slot if you had some locations that it could nullify that were also horrid to get rid of. Think of East Bight (core set) without the forced text. That would be worth using Power of the Earth for, 1 cost would allow you to ignore this card forever and not have to quest through 6 points. \n\nSadly it doesn't work in that case - and a quick look at the other threat 1 locations will find you a common theme, they're either beneficial to explore (e.g. Bee Pastures) or else have a horrible other effect to balance the low threat (e.g. Branching Paths). Which means that we still want to explore them.\n\nHowever it wouldn't take a lot to design locations in future that power in the earth could deal with well - a 1 threat location that helped the player the more were in play would be ideal.\n\nThis kind of errata to weak cards is what you're more likely to see."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1174968","commentId":1174968,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1406649249,"content":"Resurrecting this thread a little bit, but I wanted to add that I houserule Steward of Gondor.  Instead of \"Attached hero gains the Gondor trait\" I play it as \"Attach to a Gondor hero\".  I find it to thematically build on the wealth of Gondor and it also removes one card from the list of cards that are auto-included in every deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109818-community-errata/?do=findComment&comment=1221970","commentId":1221970,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1408869097,"content":"Hi all,\n\n \n\nI don't like the suggestions made of Blue Mountain Trader, despite I do agree this cards could need an errata.\n\n \n\nBlue Mountain Trader: \nBy exhausting him he becomes very similar to errand-rider which isn't something that great. I'd prefer if they just put a limit on it. I think limit 1 per round should be fine. I like to a have a new flexible ally (like the wandering took) and just as the wandering took this one has it's downside. Namely, it will cost you 1 resource if you want him. Next to that he still can be used for some resource movement. but that has became harder now.\n\n \n\nPower in the earth:\n\nMain reason I'don't like it is the Gladden Marshlands. It shouldn't be possible to kill 10 staging threat for 2 cost. But the card has gotten old and therefore I think a new mechanism could revive him more than an errata. Errata's are only there for cards that entered the scene unbalanced, they are not for reviving rarely used cards. I think the group of rarely used cards is that small that we shouldn't worry about it.
