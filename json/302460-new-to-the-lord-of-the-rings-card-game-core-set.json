I'd avoid the Nightmare packs and Print on Demand packs until you've got some experience under your belt, though.\n\nKeep in mind that the Saga expansions do go in a particular order and the six adventure packs in each cycle collectively require a corresponding deluxe expansion.\n\nI'd check out the \"Path Less Traveled\" series on the Darkling Door blog. It breaks down what cycles are good expansion options for new players. Authraw does an incredible job over there."}]}
