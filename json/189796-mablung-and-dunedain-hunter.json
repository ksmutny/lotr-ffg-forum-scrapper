I think that this topic has been discussed as far back as Hummerhorns...So, I am thinking that, although the literal English on the cards would lead on to believe that you do not get the resource, the LOTR LCG rules say that you do?\n\nEdited September 28, 2015 by divinityofnumber"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189796-mablung-and-dunedain-hunter/?do=findComment&comment=1823925","commentId":1823925,"userName":"Emilius","timestamp":1443473385,"content":"In the FAQ:\n\nQ: If an enemy is put into play directly engaged with me, has that enemy “engaged” me for the purposes Forced effects or Responses that trigger from engaging an enemy?\n\nA: Yes.
