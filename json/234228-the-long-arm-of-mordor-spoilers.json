Lewis (coincidentally, Tolkien's favourite novel of Lewis')"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234228-the-long-arm-of-mordor-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2496731","commentId":2496731,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1478790464,"content":"dr00, you wrote that \"the point of the novel is that the history we see in Tolkien's novels is as it is written by the winners of the war of the ring, as walter benjamin said, 'history is written by the victors'.\"  This seems inconsistent with your latest post, where the example is yours \"to explain the revisionist history of the novel and why it's such a departure from the original and a possible motivation, but not the absolute sole purpose for its existence\".  It simply can't be \"the point of the novel\" and also just \"a possible motivation\" -- however, taking your latest statement as the most accurate, it still leaves a \"re-telling\" that seems to remove everything I find compelling about the original, while benefiting from association with an extremely popular source material.\n\n \n\nI confess I have not read all of Wicked, and have not read Till We Have Faces.  However, my impression of wicked is that while it provides a different point of view and a sympathetic look at the Wicked West of the West, it is written not to contradict the Wizard of Oz's account of events or peoples and gains impact from doing so.  (I myself have written an alternate version of a classic science fiction short story, but I did it as a Star Trek parody rather than a way of making people think differently about the original -- still, it was vitally important that the re-telling remain *consistent* with the original.)  A LOTR re-telling giving the POV of a sympathetic Saruman may be well worth reading if skillfully told.\n\n \n\nIn the realm of actual history, the problem of \"history being told by the victors\" is a real thing, and I have read and enjoyed historical works essentially based on history as told by the losers (for example, Toland's excellent _The_Rising_Sun_.)  LOTR's in-novel backstory is that it is a history translated from the Red Book of Westmarch.  The POV of the history is explicit, it is written by hobbits to be read by future hobbits.  I would not expect a history that suffers from POV-based manipulation to *explicitly call attention* to POV-based manipulation, so I found the explanation for the Hobbit's revision ironic in that context.  YMMV.\n\n \n\nJohn Constantine had a direct quote from the translation: \"Appearance of legends about them involves the desire of people of Gondor to demonize their enemies in the eyes of future generations. Hobbits also declared to be just a myth.\"  This premise relies on continuity with the events in LOTR to some extent -- the War of the Ring and Gondor are real things, and this novel is to be understood as alternate-POV history.  However, it also requires that the dominant-POV history be understood in the light of a Gondor-POV account -- which doesn't work at all as an explanation for LOTR.\n\nEdited November 10, 2016 by dalestephenson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234228-the-long-arm-of-mordor-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2496977","commentId":2496977,"userName":"rsdockery","timestamp":1478799827,"content":"Right, I have no problem with someone writing an alternate perspective of Lord of the Rings where, say, Saruman is recast as a tragic hero, or the people of Dunland are defending a futile yet noble cause. The problem I have is, when you're outright claiming that orcs and hobbits and trolls are just propagandistic inventions, what does your story have to do with Lord of the Rings in the first place? Take Wicked, for instance: Yes, everything about The Wizard of Oz gets turned upside-down, but the events of the MGM movie still happen exactly as depicted; it doesn't declare that the flying monkeys were all made up and that Dorothy was actually a seven-foot-tall Viking berserker named \"Steinar.\"\n\n \n\nIf you want to portray LotR as unreliable, you need to do it carefully. You can't just claim massive parts of it were made up from whole cloth, because, ultimately, the entire saga was made up from whole cloth by a twentieth-century British philologist, so you're not actually saying anything interesting. You need to pick at least one perspective from which the books actually make sense. For instance, the saga is ostensibly a history written by the hobbits, so you could cast suspicions on anything they learned second-hand. Maybe Gandalf wasn't entirely honest when he told the Council of Elrond about his confrontation with Saruman; or maybe the orcs are constantly at each other's throats not because they're inherently evil, but because Sauron is a terrible manager.\n\n \n\nWhen you change someone else's story, you still have to maintain the story's consistency. If Aragorn is really a power-mad usurper, then why didn't he ever succumb to the Ring's corruption? If the Ring couldn't corrupt him, then why wouldn't it be safer in his possession anyway? If the Ring isn't really that important, then why would Gandalf risk his own life and Aragorn's on the quest? If you start cutting large chunks out of the story to fit your own \"reinterpretation\" in, then you're not really saying anything about the story at all; you're just telling your own story with a few stolen names.\n\nEdited November 10, 2016 by rsdockery"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234228-the-long-arm-of-mordor-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2497121","commentId":2497121,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1478807280,"content":"> ultimately, the entire saga was made up from whole cloth by a twentieth-century British philologist\n\nThis quote makes me very happy.
