:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nSo I've been wondering: what would it take to make LotR more interruption-friendly?  So that you could comfortably \"save\" your progress through a scenario, without worrying about kids or breezes messing up cards, or wading through discard piles?  And what would it take to get the scenarios to play faster, so that your chances of finishing a scenario in, say, 30 minutes, is greatly increased?  (And I'm not talking about \"practice practice practice\" or \"easy mode\").\n\n \n\nFor OCTGN, a save feature would definitely help.  So would things like:\n\n \n\n- a clearer, more strongly-enforced representation of where in a turn you are\n\n- which characters have taken actions (because you can't always tell by just seeing which characters are exhausted)\n\n- which cards are in the victory pile (so don't have to switch to another screen to see which \"boss\" enemies you've killed)\n\n- what characters you used to quest or defend last turn\n\n- errata\n\n- total threat in staging area\n\n- markers for indicating \"boosts\" to enemies\n\n- automatic adjustments to resource allocations, readying, etc. based on card effects\n\n \n\nIf you are playing 2-handed, it would help if you didn't have to load up 2 instances of OCTGN.  And the whole end-of-turn readying and card drawing could be made a lot more reliable (I keep running into problems where one hand gets double-draws and double-resources at the end of a turn.)\n\n \n\n[speaking of interruptions, the kids just came home, so my time is almost up.]\n\n \n\nAnyway, there are probably many more features which would make OCTGN more \"save\"-friendly, in the sense that it would be able to better represent the *entire* state of the game, so that you don't have to rely on keeping things \"in your head\".  In other words, I'd like to see OCTGN (and the LotR plugin) do more of the \"heavy lifting\", so that interruptions are much less painful than they are now. \n\n \n\nOf course, that's probably asking too much of OCTGN, which is designed to support all sorts of card games, not just LotR LCG.\n\n \n\nSo, maybe the only way to get a truly interruption-friendly version of OCTGN is to develop a dedicated computer version from the ground up.  If Magic the Gathering can have decent computer versions (and I can only assume the Planeswalkers games are at least decent, as I've never played them), then wouldn't it be nice if LotR LCG could get the same treatment?\n\n \n\nHas anyone tried?  Does anyone think FFG is involved in the creation of such a thing right now?  Is anyone else out there daydreaming of doing it themselves?  Time permitting, of course.  (The sad irony is that those of us who are most in need of a computer version have the least amount of time to create one.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193054-lotr-lcg-vs-video-games/?do=findComment&comment=1883724","commentId":1883724,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1446875419,"content":"Pray for Tragic to find the time to update LackeyCCG? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nSeriously, it has a fully functional save feature, relatively painless 2-handed solo support, and a little indicator for what phase you're currently in.

I do play more video games than I play LotR LCG, but that's been the case long before the game was a twinkle in Nate French's eye. Video games are my passion, I love them. I've played them my whole life. But I realize too much of one thing is never good so I try to balance out my video games with other means of entertainment. I've been a fan of card games and tabletop RPGs and I try to balance my time and attention.\n\n \n\nBut yes, I agree this game requires more of a time investment, especially if you want to finish a game, win or lose. No way to \"quick save\" is really not an option for a physical card game. Sometimes it's just easier to fire up a game and go. I tend to play LotR LCG when I want to do something a littler slower, and methodical. But as much as I like this game, it will never beat video games for me, and not just because of the convenient factor. I like video games more. Always have, always will.\n\n \n\nBut LotR LCG is a phenomenal card game so I will devote time and energy to this great game as I feel it's worth it. And I just like the feel of cards in my hands. Can't really get that with a video game.\n\n \n\nNow if you excuse me, I'm going to play some LotR LCG before Fallout 4 drops, give it some loving before I just go hardcore on Fallout and forget LotR exists for a short while haha.\n\nEdited November 10, 2015 by soullos"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193054-lotr-lcg-vs-video-games/?do=findComment&comment=1887606","commentId":1887606,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1447146152,"content":"I have a piece of plywood board the size of two playmats.

A save feature would definitely be most welcome, but it seems like that's a long way off. As for OCTGN, some things that might help are:\n\n \n\n- Use the notes feature. Right click and create a note and write down anything you need to remind yourself later.\n\n- Victory display: I usually just drag cards in the victory display and line them up on the right of the screen (as I would on a tabletop) to keep track instead of actually using the add to the victory display function. This helps you see what's there.\n\n- Boosts: You can actually add willpower/threat/attack/defense boost tokens to enemies and characters to keep track of how they have been boosted. This is manual, of course, so takes some work, but can help to remind you. Just right click on a card and you'll see the option there.\n\n \n\nOther digital options:\n\n- CardWarden for iPad: The problem here is you have to upload everything into the program, which can take ages. If you can do it, it's a great program for busy gaming parents!\n\n- Lackey for iPad: This one has a save feature and stuff is built into it already. The problem is that it is not updated.
