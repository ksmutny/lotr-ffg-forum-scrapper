These are two separate attacks, just as if they were made by two different enemies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96340-two-times-defending-the-same-enemy/?do=findComment&comment=947170","commentId":947170,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1389038140,"content":"ok thanks, i meant two diferent attacks by the same enemy (when shadow effect triggers a second attack)."}]}
