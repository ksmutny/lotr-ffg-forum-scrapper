I see Gimli maybe taking spirit and Legolas being Lore. I may be mixing my movies up with the novels so if I miss the mark I apologize but at least with Legolas he definitely takes on his more \"scout\" esque nature at this point in the story (seeing the Uruk's in the distance for instance). As for Gimli, he is the only character of the three who is the least suited for such a chase and still manages to keep going which is a big thematic trait to the spirit sphere.\n\n \n\nI could be wrong... who knows!
