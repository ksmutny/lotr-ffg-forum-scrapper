What is more surprising are the excess traits that never got a single shred of development later, like archer or minstrel. It was really a mistake to have archer when there is ranged keyword, but with minstrel they might have done a thing or two, just like they're doing now with healer. And maybe they will. But just as Glorfindel or Elrond lore heroes, and Daughter of the Nimrodel are not healers, Rivendell Minstrel is not a minstrel.
