And hey for a more robust card pool I can see your point and I also like to play with more variety in my deck. But I also like leaving people the ability to play how they want instead of issuing an errata for anything I find to strong or thematically weird. Half the fun for my wife and I are playing how we want to. And when the game forces unwritten changes on characters or cards it just adds to complexity, hurts newer players that may only have unexpected courage, as well as limits deck-building to the next power card or combo. For a cooperative deck-builder let the people have the tools and a rough framework and make their own journeys. \n\n \n\nMy wife and I will keep using the original Caldera, Tactics Boromir and Hama in some fun power decks and I say leave the extra rules to the official events (which is what I still think errata should be limited too).\n\nBut thanks for the dialogue and another perspective that I'm sure you are not alone in."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304841-condition-cards-limit-one-per-character/?do=findComment&comment=3877788","commentId":3877788,"userName":"EBerling","timestamp":1579788058,"content":"\nWhile it's all academic at this point, barring the game returning in some fashion after the hiatus AND sporting some new errata, I think my preferred \"fix\" for Unexpected Courage would have been to give it a slightly higher usage cost:\n\nAction: Exhaust Unexpected Courage to deal 1 damage to attached hero.  Then, ready attached hero.\n\n\nThis would do a few things:\n\n * Make the decision to use UE each round a little more interesting (as is, there's no reason to not use it every single round).\n * Make healing cards a bit more relevant. \n * Provide players a way to self-damage, which creates a few rare but interesting tactical possibilities (e.g. dropping Alcaron's Scroll).\n\n \n\nThematically, I could see this representing the sort of moments when Boromir trumpets the Horn of Gondor as orc arrows riddle his body or when Sam perseveres through the injuries and exhaustion and noxious fumes to throw Frodo on his shoulder and continue up the slopes of Mount Doom.  It makes the courageous act more unexpected when not everyone would have endured the pain in order to keep going. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304841-condition-cards-limit-one-per-character/?do=findComment&comment=3879833","commentId":3879833,"userName":"RogueSeventeen","timestamp":1580106019,"content":"> On 1/22/2020 at 6:32 PM, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Calls for Mounts to be one per character are common are thematic grounds; I would oppose it for the same reason.  The four Hobbits left Crickhollow with *five* ponies, and historically mounted warriors used spare mounts.  I also think mounts with non-combat abilities should not be restricted.\n\nThat's great and all that four hobbits left with five ponies but when a Three Hunters Beregond's best loadout is 3 armored destriers something is wrong.\n\nEDIT:  Four if he has golden belt.  Must be a strong belt if you can hang a horse on it.\n\nEdited January 27 by RogueSeventeen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304841-condition-cards-limit-one-per-character/?do=findComment&comment=3879909","commentId":3879909,"userName":"Zura","timestamp":1580124144,"content":"> 5 hours ago, RogueSeventeen said:\n> \n> That's great and all that four hobbits left with five ponies but when a Three Hunters Beregond's best loadout is 3 armored destriers something is wrong.\n> \n> EDIT:  Four if he has golden belt.  Must be a strong belt if you can hang a horse on it.\n\nbest Beregond loudout does not include Gondorian shield?

a knight would ride a palfrey for ordinary riding, with yet another horse bearing his baggage -- one knight, three horses, even without spares.  Using one horse for travel, a separate horse for reconaissance, and a third horse for battle would not have seemed unusual at all in medieval times.  The best cavalry of historical times were the Mongols, and just three horses per rider would be on the low side for them.\n\nThe fly in the ointment is that in Tolkien's world the horses of the Rohirrim were unusually durable, long-lived, and partnered with a specific rider, so it's not likely Rohirrim would use or need to use multiple horses (though as Arod shows, if a horse become surplus they would still bring it along with them).  For that reason it would be a better thematic fit if a character were restricted to one *unique* mount -- but having Eomer ride (with help of contract) a Armored Destrier/Rohan Warhorse/Firefoot is *very* thematic, as is Aragorn on Roheryn/Steed of the North.  Instituting a rule to *prevent* that from happening benefits no one -- anyone who is bothered by the idea of two (or more) mounts attached to the same character is perfectly free not to attach two mounts to the same character without a rule forcing it!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304841-condition-cards-limit-one-per-character/?do=findComment&comment=3880419","commentId":3880419,"userName":"TheSpitfired","timestamp":1580171459,"content":"If Aragorn using two branches of Gondorian Fire to kill the trolls at the Carrock is wrong I don't want to be right.
