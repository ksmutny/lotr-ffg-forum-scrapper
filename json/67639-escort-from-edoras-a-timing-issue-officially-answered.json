So you discard Escort and then you win the game. Is sounds logic for all rules in this game. 90% sure."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67639-escort-from-edoras-a-timing-issue-officially-answered/?do=findComment&comment=659823","commentId":659823,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1342525516,"content":"Not too sure that forced effects automatically get pushed ahead in a timing situation.

However another question beckons: as players always progress \"as soon\" as the correct number of progress tokens have been placed (and possibly other prerequisites are met), is the progress on a quest inherently a forced effect?\n\nTo give an example where this is important, in the Hunt for Gollum scenario quest card 3B reads that if no hero has a clue card the quest is reset to stage 2B. If the progression is not forced then players can opt to stay at stage 2B with more than enough progress tokens and wait till the perfect time to progress when all (or maybe just the best questing) player(s) have a clue card.\n\nIf the answer is that it is not an inherently forced effect to progress in a quest then the way questing is done would change significantly (at least for our group). But if it is a forced effect would that mean that the choice of which effect to resolve first is once again placed at the first player?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67639-escort-from-edoras-a-timing-issue-officially-answered/?do=findComment&comment=660240","commentId":660240,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1342600250,"content":"Nerdmeister said:\n\n \n\nI stand corrected on this issue.

That is interesting. I remember having discussed with Nate that the next FAQ would contain a more detailed and more precise turn phase table. This \"Passive\" effect definition might be part of it, this is an entirely new concept. Interestingly, we have in the rules the concept of \"Constant effects\" such as the Enchanted stream, or Thalin's ability (always wondered why that one was not a Response…). I wonder how Constant and Passive differ and if or how they intercalate."}]}
