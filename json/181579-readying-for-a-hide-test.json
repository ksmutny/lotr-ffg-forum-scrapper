So in this case it's safer to commit Sam to the quest and use Fast Hitch right away if you also intend to have him ready for hide tests. It's not ideal, since Sam has a built in readying mechanic, so you'll have to feel out how much you need him at any given time. Hope that helps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181579-readying-for-a-hide-test/?do=findComment&comment=1679128","commentId":1679128,"userName":"Hyperion508","timestamp":1435850560,"content":"Thanks for the response. After a second playthrough using the \"action window before hide test\" strategy I had a hunch it was wrong. It seemed to ease the \"oh crap\" feeling of the hide reveal a little too much. Time for a replay!"}]}
