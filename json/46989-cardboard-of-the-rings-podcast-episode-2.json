Therefore, no matter if it was technically \"In Play\" or not, it would not go to the top of the encounter deck. That is my interpretation, but I think it's a pretty solid one.\n\n \n\nAnother great episode! Thanks again for taking the time to do this!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46989-cardboard-of-the-rings-podcast-episode-2/?do=findComment&comment=471679","commentId":471679,"userName":"felix16","timestamp":1305865930,"content":" When a card is used as a shadow card, you ignore everything except its shadow text.
