During the quest phase I exhausted several heroes and allies two of which were Lorien Guide. Since I commited both of them to the quest I got to place 2 progress tokens on 2b which completed it. Do I remove quest 2b right then and flip over 3a and resolve the \"when revealed\" portion or do I resolve the questing phase first and then flip to the next card in the quest deck after that?\n\n \n\nThanks in advance for your help"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97139-timing-question-new-player/?do=findComment&comment=957991","commentId":957991,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1390091583,"content":"You immediatly remove 2b and flip over 3a, resolving its when revealed effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97139-timing-question-new-player/?do=findComment&comment=958199","commentId":958199,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1390122533,"content":"> On quest 2b of Passage through Mirkwood playing with two decks.
