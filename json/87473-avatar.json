I like that it's not an \"action\" picture, as sometimes I feel that artists use \"action\" to make up for an inability to connect with the characters they are painting (I'm specifically referring to game artists). While I have really enjoyed the artwork in this game, and think it has done a better job of avoiding that pitfall, it can still be seen at times.\n\n \n\nI enjoy that depiction of Gloin... a LOT. It's just him standing there. But instead of just a bland pose, the artist (Tom Garden) took a plain profile painting of him standing there, with a simple background of green fields.... running his thumb down his axe. I love the \"promise\" that picture holds. Something is about to get its head split open from that axe, and Gloin has this resolute and determined look on his face. He knows what he's about to get into, and he's not gonna worry about his fate. He's gonna crack skulls.  Just a great pic that actually adds to the character's depth for me...  Like I said, one of my favorites in the game so far.\n\nSo, OF COURSE, that avatar is no longer an option with the new forum. Go figure. I didn't particularly care for any of the other dwarven pics. One of my favorite characters, Faramir, doesn't have any real representation in the avatar world here. My other favorite is Gandalf, who DOES have plenty of representation, but they are all facial close-up shots (except for the new one added that is from the backside), and all of them have plenty of folks using them already, so I figured I'd leave it alone for now. So I went with the Gandalf token symbol from the Lord of the Rings: The Board Game (represented in this game as the Leadership sphere token). I thought it was a decent double fit, as it gives me a way to rep Gandalf and one of my favorite sphere's in this game (also has the only Faramir so far in the game... so a triple win?)\n\nEdited August 5, 2013 by benhanses"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=832030","commentId":832030,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1375746421,"content":"Quite honestly, if they don't give me my old Gloin avatar back, or put out something that similarly grabs my attention, I may just end up using an avatar from another game...  I have the \"Hey, That's My Fish\" game from FFG that I play with my 7-year old.  There's an avatar of an angry penguin shaking his \"fist\" at the sky from that game... lol.  I may just go with that, simply cuz I'm pretty sure I'd be the only one with it on this board... and because it makes me chuckle every time I see it... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=832032","commentId":832032,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1375747060,"content":"\"mine is gandalf becuase he is my favourite character.\"\n\n \n\nWhat Rich said.
