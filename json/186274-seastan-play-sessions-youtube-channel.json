Who knows.\n\n \n\nThe first deck in the spotlight is one I call Beravor's Path. It's a solo Dunedain deck that can be quite powerful.

I checked the 1.7 FAQ and didn't notice anything about changing Shadow card distribution from the Core rules, which state that Shadow cards are dealt by order of highest engagement cost to lowest. From the Core Rulebook:\n\n \n\nAt the beginning of the combat phase, the players deal 1 shadow card to each engaged enemy. Deal the top card of the encounter deck, face down, to each engaged enemy. When dealing cards to a single player’s enemies, always deal to the enemy with the highest engagement cost first. Cards should first be dealt to the enemies attacking the first player, and then proceed around the board until all enemies have 1 card.\n\n \n\nOr am I missing something?\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1759189","commentId":1759189,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1440700942,"content":"Yes, the thing you're missing is: in my post I described the way he was dealing shadow cards, which was incorrect. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1759208","commentId":1759208,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1440701532,"content":"> Yes, the thing you're missing is: in my post I described the way he was dealing shadow cards, which was incorrect\n\nHmm, didn't watch the video, maybe that will explain it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1759300","commentId":1759300,"userName":"entMoot","timestamp":1440704238,"content":"I think you might have misread John's original post.

It plays a little differently because you just use Path of Need to buy time to get Beravor powered up with Blood, Fire, and some ready effects like UC and Miruvor. In this case you just kill everything, clear the staging locations with your Trackers, and once Path of Need is gone you don't really care anymore.\n\n \n\nBut having played both ways I think the location swapping is more fun. And I've been using Gondorian Fire as a bit of a crutch lately in all my decks so I wanted to get away from that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1760860","commentId":1760860,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1440777828,"content":"> I think you might have misread John's original post.

I thought he meant that the correct way to deal Shadow cards was left to right.

I don't even feel like this should be erratad, as this is a co-op game, and I don't see anybody actually going through playing this deck over and over again against different quests just to beat 'em all with no effort. I do feel, however, that Emery should and will be erratad soon to limit attempting to play her for once per round or something similar, because her combo with the valour Rallying Cry is obviously unintended, and will have a huge effect on the forthcoming Nolder-related discard mechanics.\n\n \n\nI have been eagerly awaiting the discard mechanics because the easiest way to build combos so far has been through the discard pile. I already have several ideas for the upcoming Galadhrim Weaver.\n\n \n\nI think it can be very hard to design balanced cards for a co-op game. In competitive games you can release a very powerful card, and sometimes it does need errata but other times you just have to introduce counters for it. There is no countering in this game - in fact quite the opposite. The other player can build their deck specifically to help you achieve the combo rather than counter it.\n\n \n\nI think my next video will be more tame, nothing broken."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1771530","commentId":1771530,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1441289592,"content":"I watched the second video and saw that you put Outlands in the big deck.\n\nCheater.\n\n:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1797343","commentId":1797343,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1442349592,"content":"I have just released a new video, in which I take a look at one of my favourite heroes, Beorn, with the new Honour Guard and the old Fortune or Fate.\n\n \n\nDeck: Beorn the Fortunate [http://goo.gl/8XmuSz]\n\n \n\nVideo [https://youtu.be/AtJVJxLisu0]\n\n \n\nPrevious videos:\n\n1.

So they limited his cost reduction to the first card you play. Now look at the card as it is now: It's a 3 cost ally, so it will take 3 turns just to break even with how much you spent on him. If you want to use him to reduce the cost of allies or attachments, you must exhaust him in the resource phase, which means you are asking for a 1 hit point ally to make it through 3 quest phases while exhausted. We all know how that's going to turn out.\n\n \n\nIf they had limited it to just the first 3 cards, for example, they could allow you to recoup the cost of the card in just 1 turn, which makes it on par with many other resource-generators, and at the same time shut down the combo.\n\nEdited September 26, 2015 by Seastan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1820396","commentId":1820396,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1443277242,"content":"This way he could better represent his sphere and would not break anything :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nTKOVYl6qk_8.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c621617/v621617009/40208/TKOVYl6qk_8.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1820483","commentId":1820483,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1443280913,"content":"I like that better than the existing version, but I'd still limit the ability to Lore cards to limit what could be some universal and crazy reliable cost reduction (if you combine with Theoden, Grima, O Lorien, etc)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1820517","commentId":1820517,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1443282030,"content":">  \n> \n> > If we look at the history of the game, they do typically shut these things down with errata somehow.

With the Noldor card draw, supported by Master of the Forge, this has become very useful for me. But it is basically the first time I made it work. I usually play 2-player so Eärendil makes even more sense there, but even in solo, once you get a piece of Love of Tales, it is a 0-cost (possible favourable resource transfer) for 1 card. Lay of Nimrodel is especially cool if you play it from a different hero than the one you are boosting (who has the Love attached).\n\n \n\nThe good thing about this strategy is that many decks use songs without focus on them: O Lórien! for instance, so that you get a benefit from it without really losing slots. Also, more songs are coming, the recent Hope Rekindled may not be an issue yet but perhaps will be one day, and I really hope the Tale of Tinúviel will be a strong card.\n\n \n\nThat said, in my 8 decks I run currently, there is not a copy of Rivendell Minstrel.

A second option would be to just sneak Gandalf in during the questing phase rather than the combat phase to either kill an enemy that ambushed me or to lower my threat. Either way, I don't threat out, and I don't mind the lack of Gandalf in the combat phase, as it later shows.\n\n \n\nBut thanks for pointing out this very tricky card interaction!

Nice to hear you enjoyed the random hero selection. I have started a forum game based on the concept: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190886-a-random-walk-to-mordor-1/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190886-a-random-walk-to-mordor-1/]\n\n \n\n \n\n> Interesting deck\n\n \n\nHaha please try to contain your excitement!  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\n \n\nSo a little backstory behind the deck. I was mainly trying to come up with a deck that would have a solid chance at beating NM Steward's Fear on a regular basis. It's such a tough goal because you need lots of willpower to overcome location lock, yet there is such brutal ally hate that it's almost impossible to build up a legion of allies (I even tried outlands...). So a deck that would have a high success rate would have to have few allies, which means mostly attachments and events. But the only way you can get truly high levels of willpower with just heroes is through Lay of Nimrodel, which needs resources.\n\n \n\nSo that leads to needing Steward of Gondor, which leads to needing songs and tons of card draw. In comes Erestor and Beravor, and to deal with combat we needs lots of attack, defense, and action advantage. This leads naturally to Bilbo, Fast Hitch, Gondorian Fire, Blood of Numenor, and Burning Brand.\n\n \n\nIt turns out when you have a deck that does well at Stewards Fear, you can handle a lot of other quests too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1853688","commentId":1853688,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1445181197,"content":"This next video is not about my deck, but about a scrying deck made by another forum member, mndela.

Spirit Pippin is underrated. He could even work as a spirit Glorfindel reserve (in the Boromir deck). Think of it. Glorfindel has a low threat cost, high willpower and high attack, but no ability, except \"Raise your threat by one\", if you not get first turn LoV . Pippin has low starting threat (only 1 higher than Glorfindel), 2 willpower, very low attack and no ability at all. You lose one willpower and the attack power, but you win  either a better start if you not need to mulligan for LoV or you win some threat. In the Boromir deck, attack is not the biggest problem. With GF, Boromir attacks for 20-40, all by himself. You lose 1 willpower, which is bad, but WE ARE SPEAKING OF REPLACING SPIRIT GLORFINEL WITH SPIRIT PIPPIN! Changing a overpowered hero to possibly the worst hero in the game has a downside. In Multiplayer, the cons (losing willpower) and be covered by other players, now when they are able to use Glorfindel or LoV. The deck will suffer, but not so much as you would think."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=2160266","commentId":2160266,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1460271678,"content":"I'd rather use spirit Merry on that account."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=2160364","commentId":2160364,"userName":"DurinVoronwe","timestamp":1460288554,"content":"Yes, Merry fills that role better, but if someone is playing secrecy and using him, Pippin is an alternative.

It's hard to say if a Spirit hero is weaker than a tactics hero, as the sphere have different roles, but it is no question that Pippin is the worst Spirit hero. Pippin quests for 2 thats all. Bombur defends well (natural fit for brand!) and Supports dwarfs and Brand is a decend attacker has ranged and a situational ability. Dori defends. Dori and Pippin are both mono-dimensionel, but I value defending over questing (imo there are more good Questers than Defenders) and Dori has the dwarf Support.\n\n \n\nSpirit Pippin is the worst."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=2160862","commentId":2160862,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1460310178,"content":"If you're not gonna use Pippin's ability, then he's absolutely outclassed by both spirit Glorfindel and spirit Merry, specially Merry\n\nEdited April 10, 2016 by Rajam"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186274-seastan-play-sessions-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=2160934","commentId":2160934,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1460311983,"content":"Strangely enough, Spirit Pippin has some interesting synergy with Lore Pippin.
