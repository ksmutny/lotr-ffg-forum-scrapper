I'm sure they can make up a number of Dale female characters. There's also Rosie Cotton and a few hobbit females referred to explicitely in the books. Maybe even an Entwife at some point?

In fact, there are very few heroes that I feel stand out as either better or worse than the rest. I can't stand Denethor, for example, but I know other people really like him. Beravor seems to me like the clear winner, but you have to build a deck around her to take full advantage of the possibilities of card draw. Boromir's ability to ready whenever he wants is simply nuts, but unless you can ensure you benefit from it, it's not worth the threat increase.\n\nThat said, Eowyn excels at questing, as everyone knows, and one of the strongest, simplest decks to play through the initial cycle (and Khazad-dum) was a Rohan deck:\n\nHeroes: Eowyn, Theodred, Dunhere (Starting threat: 25)\n\nAllies: Snowbourn Scout x3, Westfold Horse-Breaker x3, Escort from Edoras x3, Gleowine x2, Miner of the Iron Hills x2, Daughter of the Nimrodel x2, Faramir x1, Eomund x3, Gandalf x3 (22)\n\nAttachments: Dunedain Mark x3, Ancient Mathom x3, Steward of Gondor x3 (9)\n\nEvents: A Test of Will x3, Stand and Fight x3, Sneak Attack x3, Will of the West x2, Dwarven Tomb x3, The Galadhrim's Greeting x2, A Light in the Dark x3 (20)\n\nWith Eowyn and Theodred committed to questing, you could make lots of progress each turn, and Dunhere would take care of enemies in the staging area. Galadhrim's Greeting and Gandalf would drop your threat so that you didn't have to engage enemies, Dunedain Mark would boost Dunhere so he'd be strong enough to overcome defense strengths, and A Light in the Dark could force enemies that engaged you back into the staging area for Dunhere to attack. Without a Lore hero, the Lore allies need to be played by Stand and Fight, of course, but they each provide valuable, situational effects: card draw, condition removal, and healing.\n\nIt seems there were a lot of variants on this deck that saw play, each tweaking the core base by 5 cards or so, and Eowyn was crucial to all of them (as were Theodred and Dunhere). Low starting threat and high starting willpower are the core of the deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61958-lack-of-female-heros-in-the-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=607493","commentId":607493,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1332174926,"content":"Agree 100% about Beravor.

Allowing them to get a handle on one of the game play aspects early on. We all know that the hardest part of this game is the initial rounds b4 you get your allys out and she takes that pressure off, but as any Eowyn deck player will know that by mid and defiantly by end game you are questing for a billion times more than you need.. often over questing even. This means her abilities is completely useless, as she is now a wasted utility slot. Deck builders soon noticed this as the card pool grew that there are simple so many better options to replace her with, options that carry a useful function though out the entire course of the quest. While I still think she is good for noobs to get a handle on the game, once you are comfortable I strongly encourage you to swap her out and it will not be long till you are getting much better scores with out her and having more fun, as lets face it, questing isn't the coolest \"trick\" a card can do is it?\n\n \n\n7775589.png [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7775589/img/7775589.png]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61958-lack-of-female-heros-in-the-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=607683","commentId":607683,"userName":"player582283","timestamp":1332207944,"content":"Eowyn is neither strong as some folks believe nor as weak as others maintain.  She is certainly not a requirement for solo deck building; However she is not simply a crutch for new players or weak deckbuilders.  She's very good at what she does - questing...not only with her strength but because her power gives her flexibility to provide variable quest strength - a nice feature in scenarios where you want to control the pace of your progress.   Get Faramir and Elfhelm in with her and questing by herself, with Faramir in support as needed, gives you the ability to deal with threat from 4-7.  She does this at a fairly low threat level as her other stats are weak...which is fine as she is a specialist.\n\nTo say that you can replace her questing prowess easily with card combos is correct but completely misses the point that by playing her you free up deck space to include combos to deal with other aspects of the game.  \n\nBottom line is that it's personal preference. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61958-lack-of-female-heros-in-the-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=607685","commentId":607685,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1332208784,"content":"Woz said:\n\n \n\nTo say that you can replace her questing prowess easily with card combos is correct but completely misses the point that by playing her you free up deck space to include combos to deal with other aspects of the game. \n\n \n\n \n\nno, many people completely misunderstand this.... . the point is that in a deck that where she run by end or mid game she is irrelevant, as you simply do not need her questing ability in nay way.

A time were you can field many more specific spells with no aid to questing.

If you are searching for high scores, I could possibly understand your perspective. If you are aiming for win percentage, I couldn't disagree more. Heroes are the only way to guarantee early game capability, and the early game is the most critical time to survive/prosper. If you are depending on a card draw to decently quest or fight, you are wide open to a poor deck draw derailing the game quickly + you are further restricted on when to mulligan. A pool of capable heroes gives you longer to get your engine running and Eowyn makes this equation much simpler to the point that you can essentially pick any two other heroes and know that questing is covered early on. One of the things that makes Beravor so absurd is that she is so effective at being part of an engine in the mid/end game while also offering up solid questing and fighting at the beginning. You could make a similar argument for a few other heroes (Gloin comes to mind), but it is hard to imagine Eowyn not being at least a middle of the road hero.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61958-lack-of-female-heros-in-the-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=608694","commentId":608694,"userName":"player582283","timestamp":1332364202,"content":"Boored,\n\nTo be honest, I think your point is more of personal preference.  Nothing wrong with that.  I love the versatility and utility of Aragorn and Imrahil so I kinda play to that with the deck and let Eowyn do her thing.  First time we see a card that allows Will to be used for AT or Def instead or draw your will in cards/reduce your threat by the will of a hero - you get the point- she'll definitely jump in powers\n\nRich,\n\nI understand your view.  I also have a couple other decks that I run with to give a bit of variety.  They play very differently, and I don't use the same hero in any of them - even if it results in a \"sub optimal\" line up.\n\nBeano,\n\nGood point.  I love the game - hate both scoring systems.  I only worry about Ws and Ls."}]}
