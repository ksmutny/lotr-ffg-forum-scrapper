And ONLY the Shadow Effect is triggered.\n\nAnd yeah, Unexpected Courage is OP. And because it's so OP there's only one copy of it. You can always proxy for more copies.\n\nEdited September 7, 2019 by stimpaksam"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299759-new-player-basic-question-on-when-revealed/?do=findComment&comment=3779988","commentId":3779988,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1567855783,"content":"Stimpaksamâ€™s correct!
