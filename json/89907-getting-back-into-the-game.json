I really liked it in that I could play solo.

I am in a place where I can drop a little moola here - just wanting advice on what to buy. I figured I should just finish off the first cycle and get Kaza-Dum, and grow from there in chronological order. Is this the best way?\n\n \n\nWhere do the saga expansions fit in? Are they necessary to the overall story? Are they a must have?\n\n \n\nAlso - what are thoughts on mixed sphere decks? I seem to like not mixing (though core set Aragorn is nice to mix) but wanted any feedback.\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89907-getting-back-into-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=859499","commentId":859499,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1378488877,"content":"this, to me, is the best source on the subject:\n\n \n\nhttp://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/new-player-buying-guide/ [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/new-player-buying-guide/]\n\n \n\n \n\nmixing spheres is almost a necessity, i think. or at least playing two decks solo of different spheres. especially when there is a limited card pool (hard to make solid mono-sphere decks with just the core and one AP).\n\n \n\nthe sagas are replaying the books - they are not tied thematically into any of the other APs.\n\nEdited September 6, 2013 by Dain Ironfoot"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89907-getting-back-into-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=859508","commentId":859508,"userName":"sammann11","timestamp":1378489586,"content":"That was great Dain Ironfoot - Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89907-getting-back-into-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=859562","commentId":859562,"userName":"Samwise Gamgee","timestamp":1378492140,"content":"You should also get the upcoming Black Riders saga expansion if you like hobbits at all.
