I think you have to protect the integrity of the game, and allowing an effect to exist that can allow the encounter deck to be removed from the game or allow a player to play out their entire deck meets the definition of game-breaking in my opinion.\n\n \n\n> The errata is mainly for new players and reprints. It is a good idea. The reasoning for avoiding the errata is that this is a coop game so broken cards can be ignored. Well then why not just make all the cards broken? Anyway, by the same exact reasoning you can just ignore the official errata and play all the broken combo decks you want. Nothing is stopping you. You cacan play with fan made cards, etc. The official cards are still important for those who, like me, want to play within the confines of the official rules.\n\n \n\nI don’t want to speak for either of you, but I feel like you are coming from a fairly similar place so I’ll reply to you together.\n\n \n\nFirst of all, I can completely respect your opinion here. I actually agree, to an extent, that the designers should protect the integrity of the game up-to-and-including errataing previously released cards if they are inherently broken. I think where we disagree is how we define what a broken card is.\n\n \n\nFirst, I think we can all agree that any card (player or encounter) that somehow creates a game-ending situation spontaneously or due to rules conflicts is, by definition, broken.\n\n \n\nBeyond that, though, things get more fuzzy and subjective. Does a card being powerful make it broken? And if so, how powerful does it have to be to meet that criteria—remembering that cards like Glorfindel, Dain, Steward of Gondor, etc. do not meet that standard? And should we judge that card’s power by its intended use? Common use? Or uncommon but possible exploit use?\n\n \n\nLet’s use Horn of Gondor as an example as the designers have clearly decided that this card, as written, was in some way destructive to the game’s balance or mechanisms and, so, in need of errata. The Horn’s intended use is pretty clear—it was designed to give decks that will lose allies often a way to recoup some of that loss. But is that how it’s commonly used? Well, yes and no.\n\n \n\nIt is definitely used for that reason in a lot of decks. But as the cardpool has expanded there has been more and more benefit to discarding and chumping characters (also some additional downsides including some chump-hate, which I would argue is a better way to balance this kind of thing, but we’ll ignore that for the moment) so in general I think it’s fair to say that the Horn has gotten more powerful over time and has become more commonly used. But is it now overpowered in common use? I would say no.\n\n \n\nCertainly in a deck designed to take advantage of discarding and chumping characters it can represent a very real, decent economy boost. But that kind of deck needs that boost to be viable and competitive (vs the current difficulty of the Quests). And that deck-type is hardly without other mitigating factors, including a need for steady card draw. And in no common, general use deck is Horn ever the kind of consistent resource generation provided by—the again, not OP—Steward of Gondor.\n\n \n\nSo then we come to uncommon, or what I would prefer to call exploit use. Can a deck be purpose-built to exploit Horn of Gondor for everything it’s worth in order to essentially break the resource curve of the game? Yes, with the addition of certain other purpose-built combos.\n\n \n\nBut, and here is where we get into the fuzzy subjective side, does that make it broken? I think it depends.\n\n \n\nIf someone could conceivably drop this card into any number of decks and achieve that same game-changing resource acceleration then yes it would absolutely be broken. Why? Because that would mean that any number of common deck archetypes would have access to this and so the designers would have to account for that when balancing Quest difficulty. Which, in turn, would force players to play a narrower and more restrictive set of decks. Which would suck.\n\n \n\nBut in this example, and in most of the cards they choose to errata, this isn’t the case. Rather than a card simply being “too good” in common usage (whatever that entails, considering players—at least in part—have to be responsible for the cards they ultimately decide to play) cards are errataed because someone found a way to exploit them outside not only of their intended usage, but outside of their common and general usage as well. A process that almost always requires finely tuning a purpose-built deck to exploit the quirks of multiple cards and the game’s mechanics. And in that case—a case where someone has intentionally tried to break the game…why should we then use that as evidence that a given card, because of it’s potential to be exploited intentionally, is flawed or broken or over-powered?\n\n \n\nLike I said in my earlier post, there is absolutely nothing wrong with thinking up or designing some crazy exploit deck designed to break the game. I just do not understand why FFG treats the intentional decision to custom-build something like that as something they need to address—either via errata of the constituent components of said exploits or through rebalancing of Quest difficulty. Not unless there is evidence that people are stumbling upon those game-breaking combo decks by accident as part of the organic deck-building process and not understanding why the game suddenly got so much easier.\n\n \n\nFor the record—I want to play inside the rules of the game to, I just don’t want those rules changed because someone else is choosing to break the game for their own enjoyment, with no negative consequences to anyone else. I’m not saying that truly broken cards should just be left alone because, as I stated above, that can have bad consequences. But I think FFG needs to have a much more rigorous standard to what they consider a broken card. Especially in a games that is—yes—coop. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201190-counsel-from-the-loremaster/?do=findComment&comment=2029182","commentId":2029182,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1454456757,"content":">  \n> \n> > The errata is mainly for new players and reprints.

I went looking for a ruling on that a while ago and couldn't find one. I had initially assumed it'd be like Doomed and Surge but then as I recall in the Progression Series Mitch and Matthew revealed guards for Athelas brought in via Forest Grove, and since I couldn't find anything to support my version, I assumed they must have it right and played it that way ever since.

The lines are fuzzy when it comes to what is considered \"broken\", which is why such things become controversial in the first place. I don't think a card that is just really, really powerful should receive errata. This is why I didn't support a Dain errata when there was talk of such things at the height of Dwarf decks, for example. This is because such cards may make the game really, really easy, but they don't \"break the game\" in the sense of making the actual game a moot point.

Just knowing that the game can be exploited lessens its standing as a game in my eyes. That's what I mean by damaging its integrity. A game system that can be undermined in that way loses its credibility as a cohesive set of rules. I also think it's just natural to how these kinds of card games develop.

Again, I can see the concern. Does the errata make Horn of Gondor less powerful? Undoubtedly. But I think as a couple of others have pointed out in this thread, I like the errata to Horn of Gondor because it not only addresses the exploit, but does so in a way that also enhances the theme of the card and opens up further design space in the future. The Horn, Boromir's Horn, should be keying off of the sacrifice of characters, not just them leaving play. And now there can be a card in the future that does provide resources for characters leaving. I don't see the impact for most players in regards to Love of Tales. Pretty much it was either being used in super exploit decks or not at all. For those who want to explore it as a way to facilitate song decks, I don't think it loses a ton of value in that regard, and allows for more songs to come out in the future without worrying about breaking the game.\n\n \n\nAgain, I don't think my perspective is necessarily the only valid one, and I suspect that this disagreement will always exist because it reflects different ways of approaching the game or thinking about the game.

The Horn, Boromir's Horn, should be keying off of the sacrifice of characters, not just them leaving play. And now there can be a card in the future that does provide resources for characters leaving.\n\nI'll grant the thematic improvement.  I'm a little dubious on opening the design space -- after nerfing Horn of Gondor for characters leaving play, I can't imagine they'll recreate it elsewhere, even with a limit.  It's true that it opens up the design space for subsets of leaving play (e.g. resources for discarding from play), but that space was already there, outside of Tactics -- and never would've been in tactics in the first place, for thematic reasons.\n\n \n\nBut if Horn of Gondor errata was prompted by the thematic disconnect of rewards for destruction instead of leaving play, it would've been done long, long, before now.  Eagles decks had synergy with Horn of Gondor in the very first cycle, and I can't imagine that offended the designers' sensibilities then.  Why now?  Valiant Sacrifice and Grave Cairn have the same thematic disconnect and didn't get errata.  I think it's clearly not the theme that's driving this, but rather the power.  And the power could have been addressed by a limit without changing the way the card works.\n\n \n\nWhy does this matter?  It's a popular card, it's included in all manner of decks available online, including those promoted for new players or even sample decklists provided by FFG.  And suddenly its inclusion may no longer make sense in those decks -- unless it is multiplayer or employs chump blocking, it probably doesn't.  In a survey of 100 decks at cardgamedb, I found Horn of Gondor in 22 of 50 possible decks (tactics access).  Some of those may no longer make sense.  This wouldn't have happened if a limit was imposed instead of fundamentally changing its function.\n\n \n\nAt least the errata didn't completely coaster it.  The same survey showed Master of Lore in just one of 42 possible decks (Lore access, HoN or later cycles used).  Thror's Map was in just one of 41 possible decks (Lore access, OHUH or later saga used).  In my mind, an underpowered card is a greater tragedy than an overpowered one, and certainly when an errata is deemed necessary I think extra effort should be made to make sure the card is still interesting and usable for its cost.\n\n \n\n(Love of Tales was in zero of 49 possible decks, showing it's possible for a card to be both abusive *and* still a coaster.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201190-counsel-from-the-loremaster/?do=findComment&comment=2030847","commentId":2030847,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1454521661,"content":"-\n\nEdited February 3, 2016 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201190-counsel-from-the-loremaster/?do=findComment&comment=2030852","commentId":2030852,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1454521784,"content":">  \n> \n> > \n> \n>  \n> \n> At least the errata didn't completely coaster it.  The same survey showed Master of Lore in just one of 42 possible decks (Lore access, HoN or later cycles used).  Thror's Map was in just one of 41 possible decks (Lore access, OHUH or later saga used).  In my mind, an underpowered card is a greater tragedy than an overpowered one, and certainly when an errata is deemed necessary I think extra effort should be made to make sure the card is still interesting and usable for its cost.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nThror's Map is an amazing card, even with the errata."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201190-counsel-from-the-loremaster/?do=findComment&comment=2030889","commentId":2030889,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1454522633,"content":"> (Love of Tales was in zero of 49 possible decks, showing it's possible for a card to be both abusive *and* still a coaster.)\n\n \n\nI don't really care for the LoT errata either because it was already a coaster card for me.  I've constantly wanted to make a few decks that utilize it as a means of lore resource generation, but I just find - without trying to make a solo exploit deck - that it's unlikely to be worth the effort.  Horn is an interesting change, but it is sad to see how much it effects the Rohan trait.  I would have preferred if it was just limited to 3 times per round or once per phase, or even just characters you control to temper it in multiplayer decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201190-counsel-from-the-loremaster/?do=findComment&comment=2030940","commentId":2030940,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1454523780,"content":"Totally agree with dalestephenson about the Horn.

I think a lot of us are just going to have to agree to disagree here since there really isn't a \"correct\" answer. \n\n \n\nI do want to say this though since it's something that gets brought up a lot in relation to errata. While I do absolutely prescribe to the \"if you don't like it, don't play it\" philosophy, conflating that philosophy with the majority of player card erratas seems a little off-base to me. \n\n \n\nSomething like Dain or Steward or Sneak Attack+Gandalf or Glorfindel fits neatly into that \"don't like, don't play\" argument (very powerful cards/combos that can be easily used in any number of decks and that many feel are too powerful). But most of the erratas don't follow that pattern. As discussed, they are usually born from the intentional exploitation of the rules by certain players. And while I am fine with people doing either (since I will never have to compete against anyone with an unfair advantage in this game) I see them as clearly different things. \n\n \n\nTo use a video game analogy for a moment: it's the difference between playing a coop or single player game on Easy vs playing it with a mod to fundamentally change the game's rules or systems (turn off damage or infinite money or whatever). \n\n \n\nI do kind of wonder if opinion on this issue is split by gaming tastes and history. I'm primarily a board gamer that plays this game as a coop game--not as a CCG. From that background errata is something you do only when you messed up and there is a conflict or a significant imbalance that needs to be fixed. But for CCG players I know that errata is a much more accepted part of life since in a competitive setting the designers simply have to make frequent changes to address the meta...\n\n \n\n \n\n> I hate when they nerf stuff, they can just make it so much worse.

In my opinion such cards need it more, though I see it is not part of loops.\n\n \n\nFor better or worse the designers seem less concerned with a card's overall power than they are with it being used for its intended purpose, within its intended limitations and without facilitating any exploit combos. \n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> > The issue seems to be that you are concerned that the errata punishes \"regular\" players because some players go off and find the exploits. Again, I can see the concern. Does the errata make Horn of Gondor less powerful? Undoubtedly. But I think as a couple of others have pointed out in this thread, I like the errata to Horn of Gondor because it not only addresses the exploit, but does so in a way that also enhances the theme of the card and opens up further design space in the future. The Horn, Boromir's Horn, should be keying off of the sacrifice of characters, not just them leaving play. And now there can be a card in the future that does provide resources for characters leaving.\n> \n> I'll grant the thematic improvement.  I'm a little dubious on opening the design space -- after nerfing Horn of Gondor for characters leaving play, I can't imagine they'll recreate it elsewhere, even with a limit.  It's true that it opens up the design space for subsets of leaving play (e.g. resources for discarding from play), but that space was already there, outside of Tactics -- and never would've been in tactics in the first place, for thematic reasons.\n> \n>  \n> \n> But if Horn of Gondor errata was prompted by the thematic disconnect of rewards for destruction instead of leaving play, it would've been done long, long, before now.  Eagles decks had synergy with Horn of Gondor in the very first cycle, and I can't imagine that offended the designers' sensibilities then.  Why now?  Valiant Sacrifice and Grave Cairn have the same thematic disconnect and didn't get errata.  I think it's clearly not the theme that's driving this, but rather the power.  And the power could have been addressed by a limit without changing the way the card works.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Why does this matter?  It's a popular card, it's included in all manner of decks available online, including those promoted for new players or even sample decklists provided by FFG.  And suddenly its inclusion may no longer make sense in those decks -- unless it is multiplayer or employs chump blocking, it probably doesn't.  In a survey of 100 decks at cardgamedb, I found Horn of Gondor in 22 of 50 possible decks (tactics access).  Some of those may no longer make sense.  This wouldn't have happened if a limit was imposed instead of fundamentally changing its function.\n> \n>  \n> \n> At least the errata didn't completely coaster it.  The same survey showed Master of Lore in just one of 42 possible decks (Lore access, HoN or later cycles used).  Thror's Map was in just one of 41 possible decks (Lore access, OHUH or later saga used).  In my mind, an underpowered card is a greater tragedy than an overpowered one, and certainly when an errata is deemed necessary I think extra effort should be made to make sure the card is still interesting and usable for its cost.\n> \n>  \n> \n> (Love of Tales was in zero of 49 possible decks, showing it's possible for a card to be both abusive *and* still a coaster.)\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nAgree with most of this.\n\n \n\nMaster of Lore isn't terrible but it takes so long to make back your cost that it just isn't worth it. At least Leaf Brooch pays for itself after the first use. \n\n \n\nThror's Map can still be really good but it's pretty quest specific. And it's Spirit so in a lot of cases it's easier just to snipe the location via other means. \n\n \n\n \n\n> Totally agree with dalestephenson about the Horn. They make it sound like it was the theme but indeed it is always just the loop. And as for the theme, I really think it should be exhaust to do something, and that something shouldn't be little, because it was such a thing when that happened in the books, but it only happened a few times (you're not gonna be playing the horn for a symphony).\n\n \n\nTheme-wise it should be an exhaust ability. Something like: Attach to a Gondor hero. Action: Exhaust Horn of Gondor to do \"something awesome\". If attached to Boromir, do \"something awesomer\". \n\n \n\nBut the card has never really been big on theme. Nor was it errataed because of it's thematic inconsistency. But it does at least evoke the theme a little more now (by coincidence). That's something...I guess. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201190-counsel-from-the-loremaster/?do=findComment&comment=2031213","commentId":2031213,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1454530511,"content":"\"Theme-wise it should be an exhaust ability.

Chief among them my concern that it reduces the number of modern-quest viable, non-OP decks.\n\n \n\nBut you know what? I’ve been sold on it. I hate it. But I’ve been sold that the errata (and probably some more besides—looking at you Elrond+Vilya) are necessary from FFG’s perspective. Because I completely forgot about one of the worst, most needless and most underused aspects of this game (all my opinion, obviously)—the tournament format.\n\n \n\nThis game, technically has an official competitive format. Games are scored (on a frankly janky formula that skews towards certain types of decks over others) and players ranked in an official, FFG-sanctioned way that does not take into account deck archetype. And within that system it is completely necessary to treat this game like any other competitive LCG (because it is by that standard) and actively re-balance cards and combos that can be exploited (whether they are exploited by the majority of players or not).\n\n \n\nAnd that sucks because people like me who want to play within the rules and framework of the game are having those rules and systems altered to accommodate a system that, frankly, is used by probably less than 10% of players (and I am being generous with that estimate). And the solution really could have been as simple as a Tournament-Scoring specific blacklist (or even Tournament-Scoring specific errata).\n\n \n\nAll of that being said though, as long as FFG continues to say that this is a game that you can and should play competitively rather than just offering it as an unsupported variant I do understand why FFG has to make these changes.\n\n \n\nGuess now I just have to decide if the realization that FFG sees the game as something fundamentally different than the one I’m playing is enough of a push for me to not feel like I’m cheating by just ignoring all of the errata going forward…\n\nEdited February 4, 2016 by JonofPDX"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201190-counsel-from-the-loremaster/?do=findComment&comment=2033344","commentId":2033344,"userName":"blinky","timestamp":1454612008,"content":"Pretty sure they'd still do errata without the tournament format (is that the scoring stuff in the rulebook or the Against the Shadow one btw?).

So there's that.\n\n \n\nMaybe.\n\n \n\nBut honestly the fact that there is that officially supported competitive variant is the only reasonable explanation I've heard for why FFG should care (as they clearly do) about balancing against abusive and exploitable cards and combos that aren't in general use outside of those that intentionally choose to build exploit decks to break the game's core balancing. \n\n \n\nIn the closed-system of a coop experience (ala any of FFG's coop board games) errata is used primarily to address misprints, oversights and--in extreme circumstances--game breaking and/or severely unbalancing factors that didn't appear during playtesting. But that's not how FFG erratas this game; they errata it for relative balance and to shut down potential exploit decks--just like they errata their other competitive LCGs. And the only conceivable reason to do that in a coop game is because they are assuming people are using the Scoring System they've put in place. \n\n \n\nAs for why they added the scoring system at all, my understanding was that it was primarily a Sales and Marketing strategy. When they released the game they assumed a very similar audience (and similar audience behavior) to their other core LCGs. But in practice they found that while the game sold well people weren't playing it in large numbers at Cons or FLGSs (probably because pickup games of this are hard). That led them to change the scoring system to the current, official \"Tournament Format\" scoring to try and encourage more play by those competitive player that FFG saw as their bread and butter (and as a huge potential revenue bump in they could entice them to play, advertise and evangelize the game in local stores). \n\n \n\n \n\n> Success% should be the ultimate way to measure decks' strength.
