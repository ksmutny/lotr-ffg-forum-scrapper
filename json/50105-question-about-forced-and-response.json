So when i quest sucessfully and there is enough tokens to defeat it(8 tokens) should i discard it and go to the second stage(ignore force effect) or i should the fullfiled the Force effect first and then move to second stage???\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50105-question-about-forced-and-response/?do=findComment&comment=501117","commentId":501117,"userName":"reno1051","timestamp":1310984929,"content":"in the rulebook it says quest cards are discarded IMMEDIATELY upon completion of its objectives.  in your case, the card is discarded as soon as the progress tokens are placed on it and the forced effect no longer happens since the card is no longer in play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50105-question-about-forced-and-response/?do=findComment&comment=501183","commentId":501183,"userName":"wlk","timestamp":1310992064,"content":"Actually, I am not playing it this way (but I definitly could be wrong):\n\nI consider the quest being successfull in a first step, which would trigger the forced effect and reveal encounters, then put the progress tokens on the quest, leading to quest completion and revealing the next quest.\n\nThis is indeed subject to interpretation...\n\n \n\nA similar issue I faced, relative to Signs of Gollum:\n\nI have Signs of Gollum guarded by a location, which is in fact the active location.\n\nAfter successfully questing, I put some progress tokens on the active location, are discard it as it is fully explored.\n\nCan I claim Signs of Gollum now, since I had successfully quested, or I must wait for another subsequent quest attempt since the \"successfully quested\" event is passed ?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50105-question-about-forced-and-response/?do=findComment&comment=501210","commentId":501210,"userName":"reno1051","timestamp":1310995860,"content":"1)  page 22 of the rulebook \"Players immediately advance to the next stage of a quest as soon as they place a number of progress tokens equal to or greater than the number of quest points the current quest card has.

This kind of answer i logic but forced effect is happens  first maybe??? I think there is some doubt about this........... With response effect or other there is no question at all but with force effect  im not sure.....\n\nThis not easy question....... but thanks anyway.  Pumkins what you think????"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50105-question-about-forced-and-response/?do=findComment&comment=501249","commentId":501249,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1311000895,"content":"I've also had the same question.
