I know it's not really a card I'm really going to need 3 copies of in a deck, but it rubs me the wrong way to be missing it, especially since I've recently been able to get the other x1 and x2 core set cards on eBay. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nAnyway, if you've got a spare and you wouldn't mind sending it my way, please either reply here or shoot me a message, and we can sort out the details of compensation and shipping. Thanks!\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186564-looking-for-a-spare-l%C3%B3rien-guide/?do=findComment&comment=1762828","commentId":1762828,"userName":"ossderossmane","timestamp":1440879938,"content":"To narrow it down a little, which continent would this be sent to?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186564-looking-for-a-spare-l%C3%B3rien-guide/?do=findComment&comment=1762831","commentId":1762831,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1440880317,"content":"Japan, according to his profile.\n\n \n\nI have two core sets and would probably be willing to spare a Lórien guide, but it would have to be sent from northern Europe and I'm not sure what the delivery would cost and whether it would really be worth it.
