He goes crazy over Ranger Summons in particular, which we make work by simply waiting until the encounter deck is low on cards.\n\n \n\nYesterday, at the end of the combat phase, the encounter deck was at 0 cards.

I'd actually forgotten the encounter deck was empty until I went to put the Ranger into it, and realised that when it was revealed we'd be left with a completely empty staging area (because it could explore the one remaining location) and thus almost certainly quest to victory that round (which we did)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174339-amazing-use-of-ranger-summons-did-we-cheat/?do=findComment&comment=1596202","commentId":1596202,"userName":"Aaron Youngren","timestamp":1430172755,"content":"Nice!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174339-amazing-use-of-ranger-summons-did-we-cheat/?do=findComment&comment=1596726","commentId":1596726,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1430204849,"content":"I've held onto Ranger Summons until the encounter deck slims down to about 10-20 cards a few times to great effect but this is taking this to the extreme, very well done!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174339-amazing-use-of-ranger-summons-did-we-cheat/?do=findComment&comment=1596916","commentId":1596916,"userName":"Aaron Youngren","timestamp":1430223325,"content":"I was ready to write this one off, but as with all cards, you really have to play with it to start seeing when and how to use it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174339-amazing-use-of-ranger-summons-did-we-cheat/?do=findComment&comment=1596950","commentId":1596950,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1430224653,"content":"Now I'm getting more anxious to get my box of this.
