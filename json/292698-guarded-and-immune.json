Either the Guarded card gets discarded, or you discard the immune enemy and continue looking for an eligible target. I strongly suspect the latter. To send a rules query, though: click the \"customer service\" link at the bottom of this forum, then click through to 'rules questions.' And let us know what you hear back!\n\n \n\nedit: or weird 3rd option, the guarded card is a legal player card attachment for an immune enemy.  Move over, Quick Strike...\n\nEdited March 24, 2019 by GrandSpleen"}]}
