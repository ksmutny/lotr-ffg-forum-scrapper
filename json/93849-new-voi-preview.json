Not all enemies in the future will be from Dunland and to use the same mechanic in other enemy factions would be cheezy.

And I think that while this particular quest will be much easier with a hand limit (and not really that much easier, a 20 attack dunlending is pretty much the same as, say, an 8 attack one, you're going to chump anyway) it's gonna be the decks themselves that will suffer the most."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913489","commentId":913489,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1385000714,"content":"I wouldn't call this an attempt at a 'fix' in any shape or form since it has no effect on any scenarios without the spoiled cards.  It's just a way to make this scenario uniquely challenging while challenging certain deck types (decks with lots of draw).  In fact, I would call this a hardcore validation of super big hand sizes, a designer's nod to their existence and apparent declaration that there are no plans in place for any sort of limit.  'cuz as Style75 said, that would potentially neuter this scenario."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=913500","commentId":913500,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1385003421,"content":"> These mechanics sound like they are going to be tough.

We can't really know if this is how Tolkien imagined them, but this is probably what he had in mind. The one in the first image is possibly a Dunlending nobleman judging by the clothing, and in Meccg they sometimes just used pictures from history books about celts to depict Dunland."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=914176","commentId":914176,"userName":"Karlson","timestamp":1385075126,"content":"> First thoughts: \"discard & play\" decks (which try and get stuff into play from the discard pile) will come to the fore.

I wouldn't even think about playing a deck with less than 18 allies when you have an enemy that just thumps on you repeatedly. More and more I think this is a pigeon hole card game, meaning designers try to cram specific deck concepts down the players' throats rather than opening up design space. Outlands is a great example. I understand every sphere should have strengths and weaknesses but the way I see this game is in a series of tiers.\n\nTier 1 - questing. You've got to start off with the ability to quest. This means spirit or dwarves. Playing solo you can and should add in some fighting and healing ability. But questing is how you win.\n\nTier 2 - fighting. If you have a partner, his or her job is to fight enemies. Where questing heroes and allies is paramount in deck 1 with a nominal amount of combat support, the opposite is true for the second player deck. Sentinel and ranged are key here. A nominal amount of questing support is necessary as backup. Legolas is a must.\n\nTier 3 - control. You want the third player to be the person countering that third flip. This means a back up bank of cancel cards and threat reduction. Leadership belongs here. Sneak attack and various attachments get you through the game. Better bring Sam and Eleanor if you want to win.\n\nTier 4 - fighting all the way. This is the deck that is either straight tactics or goes leadership/tactics with the twins + Theodred.\n\nUntil we get more high wp heroes, expect the trend to continue."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=914421","commentId":914421,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1385116826,"content":"> Until we get more high wp heroes, expect the trend to continue.\n\nThis is a trend?\n\nI must have missed the memo because I don´t see lore represented and I prefer lore all the way these days.\n\nLets me better prepare for what is to come and direct encounter deck manipulation is sweet as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=914792","commentId":914792,"userName":"Boris_the_Dwarf","timestamp":1385153854,"content":"The trend being turtling with lots of allies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93849-new-voi-preview/?do=findComment&comment=914794","commentId":914794,"userName":"Boris_the_Dwarf","timestamp":1385153981,"content":"I also use lore.
