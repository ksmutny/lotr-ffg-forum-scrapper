I imagine that there will be one per cycle because then they can keep it going, but they could just do one and be done. It's mostly for the first two cycles that really need it. And maybe the Hobbit saga haha"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300759-premium-packs/?do=findComment&comment=3799230","commentId":3799230,"userName":"AllWingsStandyingBy","timestamp":1570163694,"content":"Neat! \n\nBut the article also goes on to note that FFGOP will no longer be supporting Game of Thrones The Card Game with events... does this likely bode for LotR LCG no longer having Fellowships or other events either?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300759-premium-packs/?do=findComment&comment=3799242","commentId":3799242,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1570166920,"content":"> 53 minutes ago, AllWingsStandyingBy said:\n> \n> Neat! \n> \n> But the article also goes on to note that FFGOP will no longer be supporting Game of Thrones The Card Game with events... does this likely bode for LotR LCG no longer having Fellowships or other events either?\n\nI sure hope not, plus I feel like LOTR is much more active and popular but that's just my experience"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300759-premium-packs/?do=findComment&comment=3799525","commentId":3799525,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1570206331,"content":"I’m still concerned about the ‘break’ and why a ‘break’ is needed?  My guess is that there is no plan, just that they do ‘plan’ to come back, and know when/if they do, it’ll be ‘different ‘"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300759-premium-packs/?do=findComment&comment=3801424","commentId":3801424,"userName":"xchan","timestamp":1570481995,"content":"> On 10/3/2019 at 3:17 PM, General_Grievous said:\n> \n> So with today's announcement of the premium pack for GoT LCG and that game's similar release model, it made me wonder if this is the new model that has been hinted for us as well?

Do we know from the preview how great the range of updated cards is from?\n\nThat's not what AGoT is doing. The new chapters are all new cards for the 2.0 version. They are not rereleasing errata'd cards or revisiting existing cycles for the 2.0 version. The \"update\" means they are transitioning cards from the 1.0 version to 2.0. They are just reusing old stuff so the game has something to look forward to, while devs do something else (unclear if that something else is what LotR is going to do too, or it's another game).\n\nLotR can't implement something like that, so that's why we are having a break.\n\nEdited October 7, 2019 by xchan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300759-premium-packs/?do=findComment&comment=3801915","commentId":3801915,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1570548502,"content":"A break until they have info from the Amazon TV show perhaps? "}]}
