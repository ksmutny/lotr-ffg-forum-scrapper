(just making this up)...Each player raises their threat by each ally committed to the quest, if no allies are committed to the quest, this card gains surge.  I think that makes it more \"fair\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88744-black-riders-encounter-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=844904","commentId":844904,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1376974128,"content":"Good point about surge Pharmboys"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88744-black-riders-encounter-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=844910","commentId":844910,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1376974936,"content":"> Good point about surge Pharmboys\n\n \n\nthank you kindly "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88744-black-riders-encounter-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=845466","commentId":845466,"userName":"Rainelotr","timestamp":1377021245,"content":"I've only gotten to play the first scenario so far but I really enjoyed it.
