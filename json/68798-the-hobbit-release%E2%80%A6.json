Obviously I don't mean to suggest that I could tell folks what to do, but, for those of us who take advantage of it, local shops provide a tremendous service, and if we don't support them, others won't (I'm still too new to boardgaming to tell if the hobby is growing or not, but I get the sense it's not growing much if it is). At any rate I find every other purchase (and accessories) to be a decent compromise for me. Also, in the US anyway, if you buy local, your sales tax goes back to your community not someone else's (although I suppose most online retailers don't have sales tax)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68798-the-hobbit-release%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=671424","commentId":671424,"userName":"impaulm","timestamp":1344553177,"content":"When I got in to the game all of Mirkwood, Khazad-dum and a couple of Dwarrowdelf packs were out.
