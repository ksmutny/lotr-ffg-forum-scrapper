It's tough but quite beatable once you get a feel for the adventure. Getting rid of the initial wolves ASAP should be your top priority, either sacrificing an ally or blocking and killing if you have that sort of deck. This quest is not threat critical so don't worry about failing to quest at the beginning. There are no mass killing effects so try to get out some allies quickly before you are forced to discard them by \"cut off\".\n\nHave fun!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85561-just-tried-massing-at-osgiliath%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=806568","commentId":806568,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1372330540,"content":"i love osgilliath, i usually take my hama/beorn/legolas deck against it with a questing deck\n\nbeorn really helps as he can take on the snaga no problem, and hama can recycle feint/thicket of spears.\n\nthose two cards are key here. get legolas a few blade are you are set\n\nrich"}]}
