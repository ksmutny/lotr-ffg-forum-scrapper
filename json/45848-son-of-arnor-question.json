structure, I was just using that as shorthand for saying I have finished defending and we are resolving the next player's attacks.  That's why I didn't capitalize it.\n\nThe 2 scenarios you wrote were not what I was asking about.  Zambo has already clarified what I was asking though.  I'll take his word for it that combat does not \"cycle back around\" to the first player to look for more viable attacks.\n\nI think the rules are pretty unclear about what happens if you play Son of Arnor after each step of Resolving Enemy Attacks.  If I \"steal\" the enemy from you after step 1, who is the active player?  It seems like I could steal him after step 2 or 3, and then he would still hit your defender, since you've already declared the defender.  If its undefended though, I'm not sure who is the active player, and who would have to assign the damage to a hero.  Pretty minor point either way, at least for now.  Hopefully combat will be spelled out more clearly in the FAQ.\n\n\n\nThere was nothing \"nasty\" about what I posted - no caps, no yelling, etc.  I did post some logic and interpretations to be sure, but there was no name calling or anything like that.\n\n \n\nI agree with you, there looks to be two ways to interpret this scenario at the moment - at least two camps of thought on the matter.  And yeah, the Combat Phase rules on Page 18 *and* the flowchart on Page 31, could use some serious refining and clarity.  It may be a cooperative LCG, but it is still a card game and as card games are wont to do, they need specific steps and clarity.  I am hoping for an official FAQ soon as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45848-son-of-arnor-question/?do=findComment&comment=460554","commentId":460554,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1303999278,"content":"Email

You still have have one enemy whose attack has not resolved, which means you have not fulfilled the basic requirement of the Combat Phase on Page 18 \"All enemies that are engaged with the players attack each round, and the players resolve those attacks one at a time.\" So, then the Turn Sequence flowchart on page 31 says \"Next player resolves attacks made by his enemies against him, etc.\"\n\n\nAround and around and around until all enemy attacks have resolved.
