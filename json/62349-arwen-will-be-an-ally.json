We will see alternate version of characters.

I agree with Rich on Glorfindel. He has a nice base willpower and attack, but at a threat cost of 12 and a pretty lousy ability, I stay away from him. With Dain, you can get heroes with better stats and abilities, and lower starting threat. Maybe someday we can see some synergies, but right now, compared to the others in our hero pool, I just don't find him that useful."}]}
