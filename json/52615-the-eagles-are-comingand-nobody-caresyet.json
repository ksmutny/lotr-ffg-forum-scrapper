It's free and allows a player to grab more than one eagle. I actually like this card a lot. I'm just sulking because I have no reason to play it yet. I was ok when Born(e) Aloft didn't have the eagle trait. Applying a more focused lens to my nerd sorrow is that  To the Eyrie is missing the eagle trait. Argh. I'm so disappointed. I don't have a right to be. And once I find some deck creativity in an hour or so, I'll probably forget I had a complaint. We'll see at least one or two more eagle cards before this cycle is out... or else Radagast will be a one scenario pony, too.(maybe..until we can start building pony decks)\n\nI'm sure there were many players who felt similar displeasure when Mustering the Rohirrim was released in the first AP. Now it has some utility, (and having a usable card in a deck that also adds deck shuffling scratches that gambler's fallacy itch). I can't imagine not including it in a Rohan themed deck whether I win or not.  \n\nI shouldn't be complaining at all, even though search cards are not major league status. I'm at least fortunate enough to get APs immediately from my local retailer during these first cycle growing pains.  Hopefully this can start a discussion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52615-the-eagles-are-comingand-nobody-caresyet/?do=findComment&comment=523654","commentId":523654,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1315051321,"content":"I wouldn't worry too much.
