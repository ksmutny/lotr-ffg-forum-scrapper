The scenario is set up so that you return to the second stage if you don't have a clue at any point during the third stage, so even though we had pleanty of allies and resources up our sleeve, it didn't guarantee a victory. It felt more like the scenario was increasing in difficulty to match our increasing power. It was awesome.

At the start, you draw a number of cards to the staging area to match the number of players. One of the cards we drew in two games, forget the name, was the one that required you to give up one resource or exhaust a hero. Since you do not get resources until after this startup phase, the way the rules are worded, all heroes were exhausted. This happened twice.

I also put Celebrians stone in and a handful of spirit cards including Dunedain tracker who adds progress to all  locations in staging area.\n\n               I got very lucky in my first hand to pick up steward of Gondor and the song card both of which I put straight onto Bilbo. I walked the game. His ability to draw 3 cards along with Gleowine coming out a little later was just awesome. My only problem really was that to clue cards went into the discard pile as a result of shadow cards drawn in combat and then twice had to remove clue cards in play meaning I had to reset back to 2b twice before I was able to complete 3b. The only thing by the end that would have cost me was if the monster whose text is +1 threat for each ally in play until the end of the round.

The \"first player\" token never got back around to me!\n\nWhat pushed us out was the Crows surged twice and we pulled some card that made us pull four cards from the Encounter deck, and then we pulled our normal four cards from the Encounter deck. Add in the Encounter card that makes you add +1 to any Threat in the Staging area and we were cooked. 36 Threat to our 18. We played out all of our hero's abilities that stop threat, etc but it wasn't enough. We were onslaughted, if that's a word! Our heroes were all fine, with minimal damage to any of them, we just couldn't handle the amount of Threat.\n\nWe were Ho-Hum on Bilbo, but consider this: that one extra card could have made the difference, considering that we were praying for Northern Tracker to pop.\n\nStill love the game!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48250-hunt-for-gollum-preview-event-answering-questions/?do=findComment&comment=484520","commentId":484520,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1307956720,"content":"Sounds like Spirit will still be the sphere of choice after this release...\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48250-hunt-for-gollum-preview-event-answering-questions/?do=findComment&comment=484528","commentId":484528,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1307957846,"content":"ClydeCloggie said:\n\n \n\nSounds like Spirit will still be the sphere of choice after this release...\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPerhaps. I actually prefer Lore and Leadership but I see that Spirit has some totally decisive cards, like Norther Tracker, The Galadhrim's Greeting, A Test of Will or Unexpected Courage. These work all the better (or not any worse) in the multi-player (3-4) since none of them are unique, as opposed to aces like Steward of Gondor or Celebrian's Stone.\n\nOff the new cards mentioned though, Spirit probably has the worst couple. Lore and Leadership again seem to score heavily with the Campfire Stories and Strider's Path especially looking very strong.\n\nIt seems also that this first expansion was a bit Lore-weighted, it got a Hero and the neutral card combo with the Minstrel.\n\nThe big thing here also is the search mechanic, Tactics, Spirit and Lore all have got a search tool each."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48250-hunt-for-gollum-preview-event-answering-questions/?do=findComment&comment=484534","commentId":484534,"userName":"BoundForGlory","timestamp":1307958678,"content":"We played a 3-man team against the scenario at our prerelease.  I used Tactics, and dealt with almost all the enemies by myself.  I used Thalin to quest every time, so the Crows never surged. \n\nMy friend used Spirit, and kept playing Favor of the Lady on Eowyn, and took care of much of the questing duties with all his heroes and allies.  When he played Northern Tracker and Lorien Guide on the 3rd and 4th rounds, we knew we'd eventually win.  He saved us a time or two by using events to negate \"when revealed\" effects.\n\nMy son used Bilbo and Berevor (and Gloin, maybe?).  He just kept giving us all cards to draw so that we could feed Eowyn's ability to make more progress on the quest.  All Bilbo ever did besides that was questing.  He's too weak for combat.  Thankfully, the Orc encounter cards are not added to The Hunt for Gollum's encounter deck, so there was no Necromancer's Reach, which would usually be the bane of a questing Bilbo.\n\nMy threat reached 40 by the end, but the other 2 players each had a lower threat.\n\nI really like the cards.  I'm not using the Eagles search card yet, but hopefully we'll get some more Eagles cards soon to make that card useful.  It seems odd to me that they'd include that \"search top 5\" card so early in the cycle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48250-hunt-for-gollum-preview-event-answering-questions/?do=findComment&comment=484563","commentId":484563,"userName":"JerusalemJones","timestamp":1307962172,"content":"Spirit is great for this scenario, but that's because it is location heavy.

But sometimes they get close. The Wuest was harder when we didn't know what to expect, but after knowing what could come up (and what our win conditions were) we held back on playing cards so that we could battle certain effects from the encounter deck. At one point in our last (2 player) game, I had 15 cards in hand, lots of resources, two characters that were dual-sphere thanks to attachments, and no ally cards.I could control the encounter deck, but not the locations that kept piling up on us.
