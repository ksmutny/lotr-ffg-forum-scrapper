I can't rely on Silverlode/Horseback Archer or something being in play)\n\nBrok Ironfist (He has pretty good stats for an Ally, but I just can't justify paying 6 for him.  He's an okay attacker and good quester, and while he can defend fairly well with 4 HP and 1 defense, if I'm playing Leadership I'll probably have Gloin out doing all the defending so that he can generate resources and catch heals.  That leaves Brok to do a kinda \"meh\" job where other Allies could do the same for cheaper.  As for his ability, I don't want to count on having a Hero leave play, especially so specific as to be a Dwarf hero, and it doesn't happen often enough that I would always want this card in my hand)\n\nLore of Imladris (For one less resource than a Daughter of Nimrodel or a Self Preservation, you get a one-time heal instead of one that is useable every round, potentially more than once.  Heal all damage is much better than 2, but rarely do I find myself ever needing to heal more than 2.  With rare exceptions, such as Aragorn wearing 2x Citadel Plate, I just can't justify putting this in as an event when other cards are much more resource efficient)\n\nBeorn's Hospitality (5 resources makes this very difficult to afford, see above.  Also worth noting, rarely do I have damage distributed among several Heroes, and when I do, I'd rather save my resources and slowly, efficiently heal them all)\n\nRadagast's Cunning (Since I normally play two-player games that involve Eowyn loaded up with Celebrian's Stone and The Favor of the Lady(s), beating or breaking even with the Threat in the Staging Area is rarely difficult.  Considering most enemies contribute 2-3 Threat, I just can't see this as a MUST HAVE card)\n\nSecret Paths (Same deal as above, although at least it's much more likely that I'll have Locations piling up in the Staging Area than enemies, and there are some Locations that have far more Threat than the average creature.  For example, the encounter deck during Journey Down the Anduin having several copies of The Brown Lands, as opposed to the third scenario having the only Threat 5 enemy, the Nazgul of Dol Guldur, which is a single.  Northern Tracker makes this card far less useful, too)\n\nGandalf's Search (Two options here: 1) spend hardly anything to play this card and get barely any use, i.e., pay 2 to look at the top two cards of your deck, keep one, and \"arrange\" the other one to your liking, or 2) blow a ton of resources to get a card you probably need very soon, and you can plan what you draw far in advance.  The problem with #1 is that you get hardly any use from it, and the problem with #2 is that you use up all of your resources just to get a card that you then won't be able to afford to play for a while!  Maybe good in a mono-sphere or very Lore heavy deck, but I can't see this card as much more than a huge resource investment.  Too much, for me.)\n\nLorien Guide (I feel bad for including this card, as I really want to like it, it's just that Northern Tracker is worlds better in almost every way.  To make use of Lorien Guide's ability, you have to travel to locations, and in many cases doing that has detrimental effects that come along with it.  Also, if there's no active location, you don't get to use it's ability, making it pretty expensive 1 Willpower Ally; plus, if you're playing Spirit, chances are that you'll have Northern Trackers in your deck, and if you get them into play, you won't want an active location.  Awful attacker, even worse defender.)\n\nPower in the Earth (I can see why this card exists, to save people from having to \"waste\" progress tokens on a location while at the same time keeping the Threat in the Staging Area low, but really?  -1 Threat?  I can't justify that taking up a spot in any deck.  Maybe if it was -2 or -3 I could consider it, but -1?)\n\nA Light in the Dark (Like I posted in another thread, \"I personally haven't used Light in the Dark in a deck, but it does seem like an awful lot of resources to just delay engagement with a single enemy one round (and increase the Threat in the staging area), unless you play it and then a The Galadhrim's Greeting or Gandalf to reduce Threat. I suppose the latter could be fairly useful in a few situations during single player, if you happen to have that combo ready to play, and happen to have 5 to 7 resources, but even then it only buys a little bit of time and would put you a lot of resources away from being able to afford stuff to remedy your situation in the long term. Or, maybe by throwing a creature in the staging area, if you have Dunhere it'll let you not only prevent having to eat one attack, but his 3 attack may be sufficient damage whereas an attack of 2 wouldn't be? Or, I suppose if you're somehow getting swamped with creatures it could allow another player to engage it instead of it coming back to you, but really, A Light in the Dark only seems useful in very specific situations. I'm not seeing a whole lot of appeal there, but there could of course be other uses I'm not thinking of.\")\n\n \n\n* Other cards that I think are good (or at least, not terrible), but that I simply don't ever seem to use are: Citadel Plate, Thicket of Spears (why play monosphere?), Stand Together, Longbeard Orc Slayer, Common Cause, For Gondor!, Protector of Lorien, Lorien's Wealth"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46854-what-cards-do-you-never-use/?do=findComment&comment=469491","commentId":469491,"userName":"Oshio","timestamp":1305559529,"content":"Here's my opinions as a Spirit player (backed with Leadership for now, because there aren't enough good cards to do solo Spirit).\n\nThe vast majority of their actions are terrible. Light in the Dark is bad. The cards that reduce threat in the staging area are bad. The card that brings heroes back is bad, as someone has mentioned before, you should never really be planning on having heroes die.\n\nThat being said, a few cards people have mentioned as being useless surprise me. Will of the West is one of the most powerful cards in the game right now, purely because it allows infinite recursion. It doesn't get played a lot, but once there are more card draw options for Spirit it will prove a very powerful addition. Anyways, I always use 2.\n\nI agree the Lorien Guide isn't as good as Northern Tracker, but to you folks (especially the dude that also said Wandering Took), since when have we been allowed to be picky? Spirit only has THREE guys, how can you play a primarily Spirit deck and not use them? Anyways I'll use Lorien Guide occasionally.

In a dual sphere deck with Leadership there are too many better cards and it gets bumped. In a single sphere deck (well, once more cards are available and you don't have to include everything) it's too expensive for what it does. That's my opinion.\n\nThe hero-resurrecting card just doesn't do it for me. It's too expensive. It's extremely specific. And my characters almost never die. I don't want to invest even 2 slots of my deck to an expensive card that is going to sit in my hand 90% of the time. I guess you're right...you can use it to get a slightly better score by killing your guy. But seeing as my Spirit deck ends 90% of it's games at 0 threat that's a pretty moot point.\n\nSaying it's playable is one thing...saying it's one of the best cards in the game is insane.

you drew 2 cards out of a potential 12 that are of no use to you now... (the fact that I can use Eowyn to discard it does not make it a better card, I would prefer having something that I can actually use for it's value vs discarding it for Eowyn purposes).  The point I am trying to make is vs difficult scenario's, the once per 10 games where you use it and it helps, does not offset the times where drawing something else would help forward your cause more.  That is what is so great about card evaluation, it's subjective.  I actually think if that card would win me 1 out of 10 games, I would play it, I just think the probabilities of having that card in my hand at a time where I can actually play it and have it actually swing a game in my favor (vs winning more or loosing less) will be much rarer then that.  It could very well be that our playstyles or decks are different enough that you end up in those situations more often then I do or envision doing.\n\nA card like this does a unique thing, so it can have a very powerful effect on the game state, I just do not see the synergies at this point to either make this occurence probable, or make it swigny enough for the risk / trade off.  Has the card pool expands, I can certainly envision a deck where this card is so critical you would play Dwarven Toombs just to fetch it back, I just don't see it now.\n\n \n\nI really am not taking offence in anything you say, and hope no one takes offence in what I say, everyone is entitled to there opinions on these things of course.  For me, these types of debates are what I go throuh internally when building a deck, and why I check these boards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46854-what-cards-do-you-never-use/?do=findComment&comment=470703","commentId":470703,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1305721128,"content":"Troopershark

You could just as well attach the Steward of Gondor to a Spirit Hero to have sufficient resources to play FoF (should you happen to draw it before drawing CS).\n\nI have already pointed out a scenario where it might be part of your strategy to sacrifice a hero at some point. If it isn't and you included FoF in your deck, anyway, it can become part of your strategy as soon as you draw it. It is only a bad card to include in your deck, if you already included 50 cards that are all strictly better. At the moment, given the number of available cards, I don't see that being the case.\n\nHaving said all that, the cost 5 event cards are among the cards I rarely use.
