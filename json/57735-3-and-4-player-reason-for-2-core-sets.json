I have seen many reasons for needing a second set, such as 2 more trackers and more cards for tournament player deck. I have not seen any about the additional encounter cards. Would not the encounters card keep the game balanced? Most expansions have between 20 and 30 card that go into the encounter deck where the core card have 10 to 20. With the addition of 2 caught in the web card a scenario could get very tricky.\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57735-3-and-4-player-reason-for-2-core-sets/?do=findComment&comment=568720","commentId":568720,"userName":"USS Daedalus","timestamp":1324133897,"content":"Actually Caught in a Web isn't that dangerous, because you can just attach them all to one unlucky sod who's really not going to ever get ready.

An encounter set of Passage through Mirkwood consists of 11 cards - you could own several of these sets but that doesnt make the set bigger, it is still only 11 cards.

If you use 2x of the Core Set encounter deck pieces and 1x of the Hunt for Gollum encounter deck, then you've dramatically skewed the card ratio between Hunt for Gollum cards and Core Set cards. For example, you'd have one heck of a time finding the Clues.\n\nEncounters are designed so that you play with exactly one of each deck of each necessary type for the encounter so that the card ratios are balanced the way FFG designed it. There's ABSOLUTELY NO reason why you would need two core sets of encounter cards to play with more than 2 people, because the game is designed that if the encounter deck keeps running out a lot (because you've got 4 players, say) then it will just keep shuffling back in. The only reason they say you need another Core Set for 3-4 players is because there aren't enough player cards to make 4 50 card decks with just one Core Set (not to mention that you'd need more threat trackers and probably more tokens)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57735-3-and-4-player-reason-for-2-core-sets/?do=findComment&comment=569280","commentId":569280,"userName":"ziryab1","timestamp":1324298627,"content":" Thanks for your input everyone.
