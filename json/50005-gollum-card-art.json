I really hoped that my view of Gollum could 'click' with the players' and had the right athmosphere.\n\nFirst, a disclaimer, I'm not technically a 'FFG guy', meaning I'm not an employee. I work as a freelancer and I am put under contract for specific projects, I've no special insight in the workings of FFG besides what I need to know to do the job I'm hired for (and most of what I do know comes with a non disclosure agreement anyway). \n\nLightdarker, it all starts with a call for art, saying that a new block of packs (or another new project) is in the works, giving the deadlines for sketches and finals and asking to let the AD know if one is available and for how many pieces.\n\nAfter a few days, the assignements arrive: we are given all the technical specs the graphic department sets (final size of the illustration, color profile and so on) and a description of the piece. For instance, for a generic character it could be (made-up description): a ranger of the North is looking for tracks in a snowy forest, possibly with a reference to a passage in The Lord of the Rings mentioning attire and equipment. The brief is more precise when it involves specific high-profile characters like Thorin or Denethor, quoting longer passages or items or details that have to be included.\n\nBeravor was a case apart since she is a 'made up' character who had already appeared in a different game and needed to be recognizable, so I was given reference from Middle Earth Quest for her.\n\nThe main point of every Lord of the Rings assignement is short and to the point: 'Stay away from the movies', I actually like it, it takes away even the shadow of the temptation to be lazy, and 'forces' one to be creative and go deep into the primary source material.\n\n \n\nPlease, feel free to ask any time you (or anyone else) have any question or curiosity, I'll be glad to answer if I can.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50005-gollum-card-art/?do=findComment&comment=501771","commentId":501771,"userName":"DarthJalapeno","timestamp":1311088285,"content":"Tiziano said:\n\nThe main point of every Lord of the Rings assignement is short and to the point: 'Stay away from the movies', I actually like it, it takes away even the shadow of the temptation to be lazy, and 'forces' one to be creative and go deep into the primary source material.\n\n \n\n \n\nAwesome!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50005-gollum-card-art/?do=findComment&comment=502532","commentId":502532,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1311258846,"content":"Tiziano said:\n\nThe main point of every Lord of the Rings assignement is short and to the point: 'Stay away from the movies', I actually like it, it takes away even the shadow of the temptation to be lazy, and 'forces' one to be creative and go deep into the primary source material.\n\n\n\nGood job on Gollum, but I even more like Denethor.

With every assignement I strive to do the best I can and to be as faithful to the spirit of the world as possible, such comments as yours and the other ones in this thread, the feedback and the appreciation of the community (as well as constructive criticism when you all feel it is needed) are a great  encouragement to keep on this road.\n\nShelfwear said:\n\nGood job on Gollum, but I even more like Denethor.

To me Denethor is a fascinating, multi-faceted character, trying to portray him giving as many hints of his personality as possible was a very stimulating endeavor.\n\nHonestly, Gollum was the assignement that frightned me the most.\n\nFor the other characters, I felt, the movie left more  mind-space given how the actors were different from the descriptions in the books ( in the novel Gandalf is brown-eyed, both Boromir and Faramir have black hair, Eomer is younger than Theodred, Legolas may just as well be dark-haired as blond), so with any other main character I would have had the feeling that my personal view was both different and well-rooted in the primary source material,  but Gollum in the movies...was really near to how I pictured him in my mind.\n\nI tried to 'blank' him for a couple of days, avoiding to form 'mind sketches' and focusing on the words, on how Tolkien described him. Then, the first thing I visualized was the pose, I tried to go for a 'passive and miserable but with an hint of danger' thing, and I posed for Gollum myself, then I drew my sketch 'adapting' the shape of my body and my face and changing my proportions according to Tolkien's description.\n\nStarting from a human body I know well and adapting it  was the only way that came to mind to stay as clear as possible from the movie Gollum.\n\n \n\n "}]}
