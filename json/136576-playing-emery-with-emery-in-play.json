Anyway, I'm not sure I see the difference with Emery. Is the claim that the above quote doesn't apply because the cost of Emery's action is \"discard the top of 3 cards of deck [to...]\", not a resource-based one?\n\n \n\nAnd by that logic, wouldn't Elven Jeweler (\"Discard 2 cards from your hand to put Elven Jeweler into play from your hand, under your control\") also circumvent the Spirit sphere match? And I guess Curious Brandybuck too?\n\n \n\nSidenote: Thinking about 0-cost cards brought up a combo I hadn't thought of before: Stand and Fight and Dunedain Hunter. Did the Hunter whiff? Try it again for free! Or bring him in from a partner's discard pile to give your deck some extra combat bite, which you'll probably need because the Hunter just put an enemy into play engaged with you...\n\nEdited August 3, 2015 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136576-playing-emery-with-emery-in-play/?do=findComment&comment=1717606","commentId":1717606,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1438613235,"content":"Yes, it would.
