My name is Mitch, and alongside co-host Matthew Dempsey, I'm pleased to announce the beginning of the new The Lord of the Rings: the Card Game Progression Series [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmkDVibqfjU65cexxMcQDhPC52XKgWWVp]!\n \n\nIn this series of videos, Matthew and I intend to re-experience our favorite Living Card Game from its very beginning. Together, we will discuss and subsequently play through all available, official products and expansions for The Lord of the Rings: the Card Game sequentially, restricting ourselves to building decks using only player cards which were available to us at the time of each individual product’s original retail release. However, though Matthew and I will use only a limited card pool, we shall regardless adhere to all errata and rulings contained within the most up to date version of the official FAQ, hopefully making this series informative and entertaining to those players both new to the game and veteran alike.\n\nAll new videos in this series will be posted below!\n\nWant to help someone learn how to play LOTR LCG?

At the moment, our plans are to cover all \"normal difficulty\" content in the order of its chronological release, with the exception being print on demand scenarios (like The Massing at Osgiliath), which will be inserted into the series when appropriate. Then, when Matthew and I someday exhaust all normal difficulty content, we'll kill time waiting for new expansions by releasing full card pool nightmare mode videos.

I'll be sure to share your post with Matthew, as he and I both always love hearing from viewers ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]\n\nWhat I intend to do for this series is to play through everything in \"mostly\" chronological order. You're quite right that The Massing at Osgiliath came out very early indeed - in fact, it was first available at Gen Con alongside Conflict at the Carrock! That's a lot of scenario for not a large pool of player cards, and for this ongoing Progression Series, Matthew and I intend to play PoD stuff inbetween cycles. One notable exception to this rule was back in the original Progression Series, when Matthew and I played The Battle of Lake-Town between the second and third scenario of The Hobbit: On the Doorstep saga expansion; it just seemed natural (and narrative-appropriate), to do so. On this channel, I intend to \"take a break\" from the Progression Series when, chronologically, a Saga Expansion was released.\n\nFor instance, we will do the following in order:\n\nShadow and Flame - Progression Series Episode X\n\nThe Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill - (one evaluation series episode, 3+ saga series episodes)\n\nHeirs of Numenor - (one evaluation series episode, 3+ progression series episodes)\n\nThe Hobbit: On the Doorstep - (one evaluation series episode, 3+ saga series episodes)\n\nSteward's Fear - Progression Series Episode Y\n\nAs a box or adventure pack is opened, we'll be adding those cards to our card pool moving forward. So, I hope that explains quite clearly what he and I intend to do, but you're certainly welcome to do whatever you'd like. For more detail about the ongoing Progression Series, check out the now slightly outdated project summary [http://tinyurl.com/LOTRLCGProgressionSeries/].\n\nHere's hoping that you have a bit better luck, moving forward! For what it's worth, I don't think I've ever faced two first-turn Hill Trolls, when playing Journey Along the Anduin ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] \n\nSo again, thanks for reaching out, and best wishes to you!\n\nEdited December 1, 2016 by TheHiveTyrant"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222467-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-progression-series-the-hive-tyrant/?do=findComment&comment=2521510","commentId":2521510,"userName":"ParinorB","timestamp":1480575317,"content":">  \n> \n> So again, thanks for reaching out, and best wishes to you!\n> \n>  \n\nhanks a lot for that detailed breakdown!\n\n \n\nThat strategy sounds reasonable. The only thing one will have to remember is the progress in the campaign with the Boons and Burdens.

Plus, he's a member of The Grey Company podcast, has a reasonably active social life, and on occasion even seizes the opportunity to meet up with friends to play cards at his local game store.\n\nRelative to him, I happen to have far more available free time, but I'm also in the process of figuring out how to finally establish a financially stable, independent existence. Years ago, I earned a Master's degree in mental health counseling, but after spending quite some time in the profession, nationwide budget cuts meant a huge number of layoffs, and as a result, that career path essentially closed for me. Now, I'm once again freshly graduated from college, but to my shock and dismay, I was rejected by everywhere that I applied to intern - an endeavor necessary prior to my becoming a career dietitian.\n\nSo, at the moment, I'm trying to figure out what to do next with my life, and to be entirely frank, I'm not always feeling in a good enough mood to produce enjoyable videos, even if Matthew happens to have some free time crop up unexpectedly. Add in that I no longer live alone, and thus have to contend with noise pollution courtesy of housemates, their dogs, and even the occasional kid visiting them... I'm sure that you get the picture.\n\nI earnestly hope that in time, he and I are able to pick up our pace of production dramatically - but for the moment, I appreciate your (and everyone else's) patience. Thank you for your support! And for what it's worth, I do hope that you continue to enjoy each new episode in our series. Though our output is low, I do treasure the opportunity to keep making these dorky videos, and hearing that people in this community such as yourself seem to enjoy them so much - it's very flattering.

Perfect timing - I just caught up on the series, so a new episode is great news.

I do appreciate all the work you guys put into this, don't want to sound like a wimpy son of a bitsh.\n\nWhile I do appreciate your feedback, shifting focus to exclusively covering modern expansions and nightmare scenarios doesn't quite align with my vision for the Progression Series. Though my approach may not be ideal for everyone, all I can say is that my goal is to eventually cover everything. In the process of doing so, I hope that at least some aspect of these videos will appeal to most LOTR LCG players, but in any case, I'll certainly endeavor to keep this series progressing. Who knows - perhaps there may come a day when Matthew and I do manage to catch up to the latest content that this card game has to offer.\n\nEdited October 9, 2017 by TheHiveTyrant"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222467-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-progression-series-the-hive-tyrant/?do=findComment&comment=3016851","commentId":3016851,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1507572103,"content":"> 13 hours ago, TheHiveTyrant said:\n> \n> Perhaps there may come a day when Matthew and I do manage to catch up to the latest content that this card game has to offer.\n\nThanks for your kind response, sir.

There are a great many reasons that I decided to do so, but chief among them is that I consider the quality at the beginning of the old series to be rather poor. Many mistakes were made, my thought process was less logical then, and I've since significantly improved as a player. Plus, over the years I have grown woefully out of practice at LOTR LCG, drifted away from the community, and stopped paying attention to the game until relatively recently - in fact, to this day, the modern card pool remains essentially an unknown to me.\n\nNow though, as I perceive myself to be older, wiser, and a more capable player than ever I once was, I've been enjoying re-learning how to play the game, and have been delighted to share my experiences with the community while doing so. I dream of someday being able to chronicle and cover the entire catalogue of this card game's litany of expansions, and am pleased to take any willing to come with me on my journey. While my approach may not be for everyone, I do appreciate the community's patience, and look forward to continuing to work on this series!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222467-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-progression-series-the-hive-tyrant/?do=findComment&comment=3017478","commentId":3017478,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1507594881,"content":"> 3 hours ago, Khamul The Easterling said:\n> \n> Gotta love when Lecitadin kindly offers his own opinion and gets called a son of a bitsh...at least Mitch gave a mature intellectual response:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nhey now...I all did was agree with what he called himself! no name calling here! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222467-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-progression-series-the-hive-tyrant/?do=findComment&comment=3019165","commentId":3019165,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1507667679,"content":"> 20 hours ago, Dain Ironfoot said:\n> \n> hey now...I all did was agree with what he called himself! no name calling here! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nMouha!
