An enemy engages you and you engage an enemy no matter who decides to engage the other. It's in the rulebook.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45699-forest-spider-effect/?do=findComment&comment=458402","commentId":458402,"userName":"TheProfessor","timestamp":1303645362,"content":" Hmm... the rulebook, you say?  Well if you want to play by the rules, then I see that you are right and I was wrong.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45699-forest-spider-effect/?do=findComment&comment=458413","commentId":458413,"userName":"Ferendra","timestamp":1303647705,"content":"Hi there ,\n\n \n\nthanks so far.
