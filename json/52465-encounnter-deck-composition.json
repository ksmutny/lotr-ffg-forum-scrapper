I think that's the way they have to do it, lest ffg will suffer heavy criticism in terms of forcing people to buy chapter packs...but it also is kind of a pity I think, because there would be just so many possibilities to build encounter decks using the various cards from the expansions, too.\n\nWell, my assumption at least is that they probably will always use enccounter sets from the core set (or big expansions we expect to appear at the beginning of each new cycle) and just the one distributed with each given adventure pack. If that is true, I am really looking forward to community developed scenarios in terms of what mix of encounter cards will be used :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52465-encounnter-deck-composition/?do=findComment&comment=522319","commentId":522319,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1314759803,"content":"I think a nice compromise would be if in the 6th chapter pack of each cycle, they were to include 1 or 2 bonus quests that use a mixture of encounters from that set. Most people will probably buy the cards in cycles, and this seems the best way to offer some kind of reward for regular customers who are buying lots of stuff, without excessively penalising those who don't. It would only need an extra 3 cards per quest, and shouldn't have too big an impact on the card distribution for the people not getting to use it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52465-encounnter-deck-composition/?do=findComment&comment=522405","commentId":522405,"userName":"BeeGentle","timestamp":1314779904,"content":"I've thought about that, but I think one issue is that you would assume then that if you owned one or two of the expansion packs that you owned all of them.\n\nSo, let's say for Expansion 6 they include a bonus quest that involves encounter cards from Expansions 2 and 4. Obviously, you would need those expansions as well in order to play that quest. I personally wouldn't mind this at all, especially if it was indeed a bonus quest and not a pre-requisite.\n\nDoing this would also cut down on the amount of time needed to re-organize the encounter decks whenever you change quests; that gets extremely laborious when you have a limited number of card sleeves and you need to switch them out.\n\nI'd like to see more 2 encounter sets(i.e. an expansion set of cards and 1 from the core set). I think that would allow for greater variability in quests. Maybe one expansion encounter set would be very surge-ish and go with the Orc deck...or one that hinders players coupled with the spider set, etc.\n\nThat or I should just be creative and make my own sinister quests...demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]\n\n\"Quest 1A: Forced: Set your threat to 49.

I'm not sure they would want to do that, but it's a possibility.\n\nThey could also potentially create Alternate versions of the current sets that you could play with? I really hope all quests don't end up always using the core set encounters. They can make them varied with the quest specific encounter cards and combining the sets in different ways, but I think it would be a lot more interesting to combine some of the expansion sets.\n\nPerhaps after they release a full cycle they will do a deluxe expansion that adds more encounter sets they could use in future cycles. Technically they could require you to own more than just the core set for an expansion, the question is whether they actually will do that. I would certainly be fine with it, and actually prefer if they ended up doing that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52465-encounnter-deck-composition/?do=findComment&comment=522542","commentId":522542,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1314795814,"content":"I don't expect this to happen, but it would be really cool to have the Hunt for Gollum cards part of the Hills of Emyn Muil quest.  The idea is that we're looking for Gollum's trail again, so the Signs of Gollum wouldn't seem strange at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52465-encounnter-deck-composition/?do=findComment&comment=522550","commentId":522550,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1314796560,"content":"Kiwina said:\n\nI don't expect this to happen, but it would be really cool to have the Hunt for Gollum cards part of the Hills of Emyn Muil quest.  The idea is that we're looking for Gollum's trail again, so the Signs of Gollum wouldn't seem strange at all.\n\n\n\nBut why not???

It's not very user friendly when you have a web of which expansions are required in order to play another expansion. The idea of LCGs so far seems to just be that you need only the core set and then you can add any expansion you want in any order.\n\nI hope they end up just requiring other expansions. I don't think it's too much to ask and it will enhance the game. They should just clearly note it somewhere so that people don't pick up an expansion expecting to play through it and then after they've already purchased it realize they need to purchase other expansions in order to actually use it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52465-encounnter-deck-composition/?do=findComment&comment=522599","commentId":522599,"userName":"Archadian","timestamp":1314805149,"content":"Another neat solution would be to include cards from the expansions in encounter decks, but also providing substitution cards from the core set that can be used in case the player doesn't own the expansion set.

I think the problem is that is fine for an expansion pack to require the core set, but it's difficult to require other expansion for new expansions. The best way to do this is, indeed, to provide a lot of encounter cards, considering that there were a lot of player cards in the core set and provide limited player cards. (On another note I wonder what we will get...a new sphere maybe?).\n\nStill, there will be an angry mob if ffg requires you to own both, core set and the deluxe expansion to enjoy the newest adventure packs. On the other hand, there always will be an angry mob I guess, because it seems very diffiuclt to satisfy the customers who buy everything and still make it easy and affordable for new players to join in on the fun."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52465-encounnter-deck-composition/?do=findComment&comment=522733","commentId":522733,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1314831091,"content":" The \"recommended\" list with core set alternatives would be cool.  Hills of Emyn Muil could recommend using Hunt for Gollum, but if you don't have it just use River Anduin instead.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nA \"quest pack\" through PoD could also be a sweet way to mix AP's.  You would buy a pack of just quest cards for 5-10 quests, and these quests would use encounter sets from the core set, big box releases, and adventure pack cycles.  The PoD product could say what expansions you'll need.  If you don't have all the used expansions you don't have to demand a print.  That way, you only spend $5-10 for a whole bunch of new quests that use the cards you've already bought."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52465-encounnter-deck-composition/?do=findComment&comment=522910","commentId":522910,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1314874210,"content":"This is an odd thing for me to say because I'm not a LOTR theme guy, but I think that the adventure pack encounters may also be thematically inappropiate.

Based on my own experience working at a game store, I can say that many, many people buy products without reading the label. Game store owners pride themselves on customer service so of course they would refund the purchase and be stuck with an opened product they will have difficulty selling. This could potentially sour the FLGS owner from FFG products. Most gaming companies do everything they can to keep FLGS happy and afloat. Therefore I think this style of scenario is very unlikely for retail adventure packs.\n\n \n\nHowever, I think print on demand is the way to go if they are going to use scenarios that mix and match adventure pack encounter cards (without using core set encounter cards). In general, the majority of people buying POD products are already superfans and will understand enough about the game to know which adventure packs are required. The \"Death Angel\" mission pack was about 20 cards for $5. For the LotR:LCG the POD product could have 3 scenario cards, 3 neutral attachment or ally cards, and 14 new encounter cards. The rest of the encounter cards would be drawn from existing adventure packs.
