Is it possible to put some o cost cards from other spheres into my deck and play them? Or do I need their resourcesymbol to play them even if they cost 0?\n\n \n\nThanks alot!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194551-0-cost-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1910499","commentId":1910499,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1448703543,"content":"Rulebook, p.12:\n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> Cards with a cost of zero do not require a resource to\n> \n> be spent in order to pay their cost, but they do require\n> at least one hero under that player’s control to have a\n> resource icon that matches the card’s sphere."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194551-0-cost-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1910504","commentId":1910504,"userName":"Kako K.","timestamp":1448704842,"content":"Thank you.

(I guess this even applies if Elrond is paired with Spirit Theoden, and you try to play a Snowbourn Scout as your first Rohan ally without any Leadership heroes, or similar Grima shenanigans...)\n\n- Hero Gandalf can play 0-cost off-sphere cards, but only off the top of the deck."}]}
