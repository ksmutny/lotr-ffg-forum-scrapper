We finished with a score of 124.\n\n \n\nJust wondering what your best score improvements were from one attempt at a quest to another. The first time we did quests like Journey Down the Anduin, and Conflict at the Carrock, we had pretty high scores but were able to drop them the second or third time.\n\n \n\nOur best improvement so far was from 171 to 124 on Journey Down the Anduin. Got any best score improvements and if you can remember, how you changed things up to get a lower score?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227482-best-score-improvement/?do=findComment&comment=2362362","commentId":2362362,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1471030638,"content":"Add me as a friend and you can compare my hcores with you in the web quest log"}]}
