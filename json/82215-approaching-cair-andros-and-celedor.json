For example, commit characters to the quest, go through all of the staging step, and there is an action window before quest resolution.  You can even play Galadhrim's Greeting at this moment to lower your threat in the player action and make this a willpower-based quest if you get below 37.\n\n2) Celador can't do anything other than commit to the quest while in the staging area.  As for whether or not he is \"ready,\" I'm not sure.  I'm of a mind to say that ready/exhausted do not apply to him while he is in the staging area.  While there, Celador is just an objective encounter card (his card text says \"objective - ally\").  Ready/exhausted are concepts that apply to character cards (heroes and allies).  He doesn't become a regular ally until text on stage 3B does that for you. If I'm wrong, however, and those concepts do apply, he's surely ready."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82215-approaching-cair-andros-and-celedor/?do=findComment&comment=868396","commentId":868396,"userName":"cyberlettuce","timestamp":1379432593,"content":"Another question about Celedor.

And IIRC the conclusion was that he could do so. So why shouldn't the players be able to heal Celador? Furthermore, there is nothing that indicates that you have to control the wounded character (you can heal another players characters, for example)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82215-approaching-cair-andros-and-celedor/?do=findComment&comment=868802","commentId":868802,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1379453067,"content":"mmm.....you may be correct on that one. i wasnt aware of that discussion.\n\nrich"}]}
