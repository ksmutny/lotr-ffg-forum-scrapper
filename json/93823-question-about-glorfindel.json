Not to mention that he has to be one of the most thematic hero's in the game... willing to sacrifice himself to slow down or hopefully stop the enemy.\n\nEdited November 20, 2013 by chuckles"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93823-question-about-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=913601","commentId":913601,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1385018622,"content":"Coming to the defense of Lore Glorfindel:\n\nI´ve used him in the nightmare decks recently.
