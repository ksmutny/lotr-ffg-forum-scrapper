An encounter card makes you raise your threat by 6, so you'd reach 53 threat. Then, with Favor of the Valar you'd drop your threat to 45, which means you are reducing your threat by 8. Now, Ramshackle Manor effect comes into play, and instead of reducing your threat by 8, you reduce it only by 1, which means your threat drops from 53 to 52, and you'd still die...\n\n \n\n2) Favor of the Valar doesn't reduce your threat \"by\" an specific amount, instead it reduces your threat \"to\" an specific amount, so it isn't affected by Ramshackle Mannor and in case you reach 50 threat or higher, you reduce your threat to 45\n\n \n\n¿?\n\nEdited September 28, 2017 by Rajam"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259537-about-murder-at-the-prancing-pony/?do=findComment&comment=3001715","commentId":3001715,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1506612440,"content":"I think since Favor of Valar sets *to* a specific amount rather than reducing *by* a specific amount, it would be Rajam's #2.  However, *if* Ramshackle nerfed Favor of the Valar, I think it would be in the form of Rajam's #1 -- it wouldn't end up at 49 unless Favor of Valar kicked in when threat was *exactly* 50, and going past 50 would make it not work at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259537-about-murder-at-the-prancing-pony/?do=findComment&comment=3001724","commentId":3001724,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1506612780,"content":"Sounds worthy of an official rules question!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259537-about-murder-at-the-prancing-pony/?do=findComment&comment=3001915","commentId":3001915,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1506619279,"content":"Seastan recently got a ruling in the context of the Dire keyword and A Elbereth, etc., which disallowed the planned shenanigan.

This is important because there are several ‘threat reduction’ effects in the game that do not use the word reduce.\n> For example, Elrond’s Counsel says “lower your threat by 3” but I think players understand that if I cannot reduce my threat, then I cannot use Elrond’s Counsel to lower it either. \n> Similarly, if I cannot reduce my threat then I cannot ‘set’ my threat to a value that is lower than my current one because I would have to reduce it in order to do that.\n> I think you will find that Vanish from Sight can still be a useful card when playing Mount Doom, especially when it comes to making fortitude tests, but you cannot combo it with A Elbereth! Gilthonial! to reduce your threat. \n\nBut Ramshackle Manor seems a little more nuanced than \"cannot be reduced\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259537-about-murder-at-the-prancing-pony/?do=findComment&comment=3002175","commentId":3002175,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1506629250,"content":"With this ruling it seem that sent your threat to 45 means \"reduce your threat to 45\" (and it work this way in many others games).

So if Ramshackle Manor is in play when Favor of the Valar triggers, you cannot reduce your threat by more than 1.
