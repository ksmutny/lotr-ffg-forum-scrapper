I asked for several reasons, that you covered.\n\nAnother reason i asked was CatC. If second hammer player was below whatever all those trolls levels are and my questing was above my quest characters are going to get hammered, even if i have a snare or two, bcecause i can't use snare until next round.\n\nThat question is actually different than the one you answered, just because my quest deck is toast. I'm not asking a question here, just trying to figure how i let my quest deck get so high, and why i didn't bring them out one at a time. Stupid, stupid stupid on my part. All those trolls. Ouch.\n\nYou answered my questions great. Thank you.\n\nEdited April 19, 2014 by dizpatcher"}]}
