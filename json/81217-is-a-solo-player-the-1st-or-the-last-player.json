Looks like all previous encounter cards is just discarded from play. Cose they cannot move to you new staging area but since there is no other player there is no other staging area anymore until stage 4 so remaind encounter cards just discarded. I play this way and looks like is only way right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81217-is-a-solo-player-the-1st-or-the-last-player/?do=findComment&comment=777167","commentId":777167,"userName":"Cutievalkyrie","timestamp":1364037362,"content":"That is why i could tell FFG didnt test this quest.
