But (at least) on ringsdb.com are some more cards with a changed text - e.g. A Burning Brand. Furthermore, even the image has changed. So it seems to me, that these changes are offical and not just a joke from ringsdb. Anyhow, not all cards which are different to mine are marked as errata'ed. Is there a reliable source of player cards which have been modified?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312365-cards-with-an-errata/?do=findComment&comment=4010992","commentId":4010992,"userName":"TrueLolzor","timestamp":1604614334,"content":"http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Errata=Has_Text_Errata [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Errata=Has_Text_Errata]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312365-cards-with-an-errata/?do=findComment&comment=4011096","commentId":4011096,"userName":"DatNerd","timestamp":1604648260,"content":"Thanks"}]}
