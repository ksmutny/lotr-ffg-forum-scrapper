We know the next cycle is done production already*, so all the playtesters are either playtesting the following cycles or have all been dropped as playtesters. Now there's the NDA and all, but announcing the development of the \"LOTR card game will continue\" to a room that likely contained a bunch of dropped playtesters doesn't seem like a wise move.\n\n \n\n*(In fact, based on product codes, we know that this cycle was developed before Annuminas, which came out 16 months ago)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265058-the-real-big-announcement/?do=findComment&comment=3118392","commentId":3118392,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1512888920,"content":"Good observation, Seastan.
