Note that an eliminated player's threat does not, however, increase beyond his threat elimination level (50, unless otherwise specified by the quest rules or by a card effect).\"\n\n \n\nNote that threat elimination in the above quote is not the same thing as score. For the eliminated player, score is threat elimination level (which they clarify cannot be higher than 50, even if your threat gain might have exceeded 50) + threat penalty of each dead hero. \n\nEdited November 29, 2016 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/235771-question-about-the-score/?do=findComment&comment=2519369","commentId":2519369,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1480447148,"content":"Huh, so that makes the self-sacrificing deck archetype way less appealing if you care about score.
