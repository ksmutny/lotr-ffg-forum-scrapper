That would allow for the coming APs and would also free up some space so the individual compartments don't need to be so full. When the compartments get really full it is tough to get the cards out. I may lay a ribbon or something in the tighter compartments to help deal with that.\n\n\nJB"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61566-the-flambeau-7004r-storage-solution/?do=findComment&comment=603574","commentId":603574,"userName":"jeffscottbrown","timestamp":1331197478,"content":"jeffscottbrown said:\n\n I recorded a brief video which shows how the Flambeau 7004R container works out for storing all of the current cards.
