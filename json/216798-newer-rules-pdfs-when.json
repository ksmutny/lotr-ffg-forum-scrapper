We didn't have the insert with us and went to get a PDF, but it wasn't available. It seems a few APs from Angmar are not available either, nor the last saga box. When will we see these added to the website?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216798-newer-rules-pdfs-when/?do=findComment&comment=2159345","commentId":2159345,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1460214270,"content":"\"'When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,...When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves.'\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216798-newer-rules-pdfs-when/?do=findComment&comment=2162210","commentId":2162210,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1460376095,"content":"I guess FFG wants people to buy the actual cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216798-newer-rules-pdfs-when/?do=findComment&comment=2172523","commentId":2172523,"userName":"soullos","timestamp":1460770163,"content":"I hope they come soon. It's crazy how long it's been since we had a rules insert uploaded to the site. I like to load these on my phone so I have the rules available when I play (granted, I need to start playing more, I'm so behind haha). Beats digging around for the insert itself."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216798-newer-rules-pdfs-when/?do=findComment&comment=2173410","commentId":2173410,"userName":"Iskandr","timestamp":1460848127,"content":"> I guess FFG wants people to buy the actual cards.\n\nIf this is the reason, then ugh. It'd be nice to hear something about it. I don't always remember to grab rules while I'm running out the door to the store or coffee shop to play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216798-newer-rules-pdfs-when/?do=findComment&comment=2176267","commentId":2176267,"userName":"Bellator Sardel","timestamp":1461030812,"content":"One of our guys is awesome.  He's put together a binder with a rulebook, all the rules inserts from each Deluxe Expansion and Adventure Pack, and a copy of the FAQ (I think).  And if I remember correctly, he also has a few copies of the Campaign tracking sheets and Scenario Scoring sheets.  I need to put one together for myself when I'm playing solo at home."}]}
