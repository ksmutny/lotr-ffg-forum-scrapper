(No one attacks during the Engagement phase.  Dunhere can still only attack during the Combat phase.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64890-2-questions/?do=findComment&comment=633892","commentId":633892,"userName":"alboy","timestamp":1337600928,"content":"Thanks for confirming the answer to question one.\n\nl know Dunhere can only use his ability in the combat phase, l take it the creature in the staging area can not attack back and only stays there if Dunhere did not kill him.\n\nAfter rereading what l said l know l must of confused you about my second question, this relates to Step one of phase 5 Encounter, Player engagement, dose this mean it is the only way of a player engaging with a creature who has a higher Treat level than you do and nothing more than this?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64890-2-questions/?do=findComment&comment=633901","commentId":633901,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1337602320,"content":" Yes, an enemy in the staging area that is attacked by Dunhere cannot attack back (where in the turn sequence would this occur?)\n\nAnd to answer your second question, yes - if you want to engage an enemy with an engagement cost that is higher than your threat, the optional engagement step of phase 5 is the only way to accomplish this (other than a card effect that says so, obviously)."}]}
