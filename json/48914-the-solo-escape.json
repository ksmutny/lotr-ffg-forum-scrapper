This quest for 2 and more players. But even that way is still to easy. I play many tmies with my  friend and never lose.  actually we dont lose solo game either. we need some new quests and encounter as quick as possible. Otherwise i start to look already for  Midlle earth ccg. Yes is old game but looks very interesting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48914-the-solo-escape/?do=findComment&comment=489947","commentId":489947,"userName":"cwmills2","timestamp":1308837657,"content":"The old game is very interesting, at least in its original \"Wizards\" form.  I'm afraid I never really liked the attempt to take it into \"Playing the bad guys\" and ICE eventually over-complicated the whole concept.   But FFG forgive me if I see some lineage between the current game and the old ICE product.  Oh, the games are completely different, but I still get some funny twinges of nostalgia from as I read the rules to the LCG."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48914-the-solo-escape/?do=findComment&comment=489984","commentId":489984,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1308841086,"content":"cwmills said:\n\nThe old game is very interesting, at least in its original \"Wizards\" form.  I'm afraid I never really liked the attempt to take it into \"Playing the bad guys\" and ICE eventually over-complicated the whole concept.   But FFG forgive me if I see some lineage between the current game and the old ICE product.  Oh, the games are completely different, but I still get some funny twinges of nostalgia from as I read the rules to the LCG.\n\n\n\nI use to play a lot of decipher lotr  tcg.
