There is usually no distinction between optional engagements, engagement due to engagement checks or engagement due to card effects. All of these would trigger Mablung's effect. This is true whether the game refers to you engaging an enemy or an enemy engaging you.\n\nIf there is a meaningful distinction, it will be explicit, such as the enemy \"Zealous Traitor\" from Heirs of Numenor: \"Forced: When Zealous Traitor engages a player, that player must deal 1 damage to each ally he controls. (2 damage instead if Zealous Traitor was not optionally engaged.)\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294045-mablung-tactics-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3680666","commentId":3680666,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1555444798,"content":"> 1 hour ago, bitzurock said:\n> \n> \"Response: After you engage an enemy, add 1 resource to Mablung's resource pool.

Meaning that with proper shenanigans you can trigger his ability multiple times in one single turn, like planning, questing, encounter, combat and refresh phase... all are very unlikely unless you devoted yourself and your deck to this single purpose but 2 or even 3 are quite easy to achieve in  a deck using the right cards and especially in combo with like tactic aragorn.\n\n \n\nMablung is your Las Vegas hero card equivalent....\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294045-mablung-tactics-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3681185","commentId":3681185,"userName":"bitzurock","timestamp":1555485031,"content":"Ok.
