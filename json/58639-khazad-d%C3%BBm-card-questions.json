So far... very fun!\n\nRan into a couple of questions though, and I wonder for those who have the set already or have been studying the cards - I need some clarification.\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nOrc Horn Blower\nOrc. Summoner.\n\nSurge.\n\nWhen Revealed: Reveal 1 card from the encounter deck and add it to the staging area.\n\nMy question: does this function basically like Surge 2, or is the When Revealed text just redundant (i.e. explaining the surge mechanic on the card)?\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nBook of Mazarbul\nItem. Artifact.\n\nRestricted.\n\nAction: Exhaust a hero to claim this objective. Then, attach Book of Mazarbul to that hero. (If detached, return Book of Mazarbul to the staging area.)\n\nAttached hero cannot attack and does not exhaust to commit to a quest.\n\n[Text from The Seventh Level 1A reads: Setup: Search the encounter deck for Book of Mazarbul, and have the first player attach it to a hero of his choice. Shuffle the encounter deck.]\n\n[Text from Rules Insert reads: Book of Mazarbul: This scenario uses the Book of Mazarbul objective card. If Book of Mazarbul is detached from a hero, either through a card effect or due to the hero it is attached to leaving play, then it returns to the staging area, and can be claimed by any player who triggers its action. A hero can also exchange to claim Book of Mazarbul even if it is attached to another hero. If Book of Mazarbul is removed from the game, it should be set aside and ignored for the rest of the game.]\n\nMy question: During set up, do you need to exhaust the initial hero to whom it is attached? Just going off the cards, it seems a bit unclear. The reading from the rules makes me think you only follow the Action text on the card when you are claiming it from the staging area by a hero after it has been detached at some point or to make an exchange.\n\nAppreciate your thoughts. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58639-khazad-d%C3%BBm-card-questions/?do=findComment&comment=576480","commentId":576480,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1326028883,"content":"About Orc. I think surge 2 is to powerful so they decide to make surge 1 + one more card by when revealed effect.

However perhaps they left the second card reveal as a \"When Revealed\" effect because it enables us to cancel the effect if we want to.\n\nBook of Marzabul: I think you're right about this. At the beginning of the turn you get the book without having to exhaust but then if you want to transfer the book or reclaim it after it was lost and moved to the staging area, you have to exhaust. I really like the book's effect, very interesting mechanic. I used it to good effect on Thalin during the one time I've tried The Seventh Level.
