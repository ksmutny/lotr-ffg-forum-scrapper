I've seen one place that sells the encounter sets individually, ToyWiz, but they only have some of the core set ones and I've never heard of them before (and the fact that they still list Hills of Emyn Muil as \"Pre-order\" kind of frightens me).\n\nDoes anyone know a good way to go about this without spending a ton of money buying multiple core (I actually already have 2 core sets, but I'm not buying any more)/deluxe sets? ToyWiz had them priced at about $1 each, and I'd totally be willing to buy several copies of each at that price."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75763-buying-extra-encounter-sets/?do=findComment&comment=735325","commentId":735325,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1355753660,"content":"only other place ive seen is Ebay\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75763-buying-extra-encounter-sets/?do=findComment&comment=735333","commentId":735333,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1355754526,"content":"I can't seem to even find any individual stuff on ebay, just the full packs. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75763-buying-extra-encounter-sets/?do=findComment&comment=735371","commentId":735371,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1355759544,"content":"Svenn said:\n\nI can't seem to even find any individual stuff on ebay, just the full packs. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\n\n\ni would keep checking, they may come up. also try posting on the forum (though youve already done that of course) asking to buy\n\nsome people will have extras somewhere\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75763-buying-extra-encounter-sets/?do=findComment&comment=735484","commentId":735484,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1355773483,"content":"I second Svenn's request.
