I have the core set and one expansion for it. Should I buy them according to their original releases or should I buy what ones I want to play?\n\n \n\nWelcome, both to the game and the forums!\n\n \n\nOpinion on this is kind of divided and there isn’t really a “right” answer. Picking up the APs in chronological order of release certainly gives you more options both in terms of player cards you can build with as well as Quests you can play (as picking up a random AP can leave the already thin narrative incomprehensible outside of the context of its cycle—not to mention without the associated Deluxe you may literally just not be able to play the Quest). But getting an idea of the type of deck you want to build and target-buying only those Deluxes and APs that are “Must Haves” for that deck archetype can be a much cheaper option in the short-term, even if it leaves you with fewer Quests you can actually play…\n\n \n\nI’ve talked about this a lot recently here so I’ll just quote myself from a previous post since it's all pretty relevant:\n\n \n\nAs for “Must Have” expansions…it kind of depends. There are several if you are trying to build a specific “theme” deck. Dwarves, for instance, want Return to Mirkwood, Khazad Dum and the two Hobbit boxes. Outlands and Gondor really want the Heirs of Numenor Deluxe and most of the Against the Shadow cycle to be able to do some deck-building within the trait-type.\n\n \n\nBut for my money, chasing any specific player cards is the wrong way to expand this game. Or at least, the less satisfying way.\n\n \n\nPersonally, I always recommend to new players to start with the Core Set and (difficulty aside, because it WILL be hard) see if they like the game. From there if they want to expand, I always point towards the first cycle—The Shadows of Mirkwood. Not because these quests and player cards are the BEST (they aren’t, though most of the quests are very solid and enjoyable) but because they are designed specifically to slowly teach players the finer points of the game quest-by-quest. Hunt for Gollum introduces some interesting treacheries and focuses on finding objective attachments, Conflict at the Carrock forces you to learn to deal with powerful Boss-type enemies and strategies to do so, Journey to Rhosgobel teaches you about treachery management and healing, etc.\n\n \n\nAnd while many of the player cards have since been replaced with more effective alternatives as the cardpool has grown, some are still very clutch (the Dunedain signals, the resource-fixing songs, A Burning Brand, Fast Hitch, Dain, etc.).\n\n \n\nYMMV, of course. I would never say that my way is the ONLY way. But I definitely think getting the expansions chronologically provides the best experience so that you, as a player, can grow along with the player and encounter cards. And after you finish Mirkwood, Khazad Dum and The Dwarrodelf awaits with a focus on Noldor and Dwarf player cards and more combat-focused quests (also secrecy, but that will take a LONG time to pay off in the cardpool) and that is a perfect place to slot in the two Hobbit Saga Expansions (with their very heavy focus on dwarf-traited player cards).\n\n \n\nAnyway, long comment is long. But whatever you choose to do, I think you’ll have a lot of fun. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201432-where-is-the-man-with-the-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2035357","commentId":2035357,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1454694853,"content":"> Just in case:\n> \n>  \n> \n> http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Dernhelm [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Dernhelm]\n\n \n\nI knew who it was but I didn't see any spoilers regarding that character.

May not always be worth it.\n\nIn case of Gandalf, you're exhausting 3wp/3atk/3def to ready two 2wp/2atk/2def and turn them into the two 2wp/3atk/3def guys. So, you gain either way, though slightly less for wp (only +1wp), but pretty **** good in atk and def (both +3). In case of Cirdan, you gain nothing in terms of wp, but you gain +4 for both atk and def.\n\nEdited February 7, 2016 by John Constantine"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201432-where-is-the-man-with-the-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2038109","commentId":2038109,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1454860344,"content":"12644743_10206100442773453_8636015631309 [https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/12644743_10206100442773453_8636015631309296643_n.jpg?oh=83eca08f0357e8f993e32ff8d96c0708&amp;oe=576CA6BF]12645161_10206100443973483_8458806469953 [https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/12645161_10206100443973483_8458806469953897469_n.jpg?oh=73d5d416a65a88990b27c2e642304b57&amp;oe=5739CA01]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201432-where-is-the-man-with-the-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2038110","commentId":2038110,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1454860367,"content":"12670446_10206100448213589_8685715784728 [https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/v/t1.0-9/12670446_10206100448213589_8685715784728092276_n.jpg?oh=b42bd1e9f3f4c0ee75cfc6a090f2e01c&amp;oe=57325257]12688388_10206100451093661_8704844691388 [https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/12688388_10206100451093661_8704844691388711841_n.jpg?oh=94758e6020f807153a9ea790c84eb1f5&amp;oe=572369EC]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201432-where-is-the-man-with-the-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2038111","commentId":2038111,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1454860393,"content":"12644896_10206100453133712_2110577455432 [https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/12644896_10206100453133712_2110577455432196535_n.jpg?oh=b53fcb67fc0b915fc1dcee6235eb8d8b&amp;oe=572FE73E]12651121_10206100454093736_2525883211256 [https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/12651121_10206100454093736_2525883211256319880_n.jpg?oh=a43368ba130131109f4065e985b8187b&amp;oe=573D937D]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201432-where-is-the-man-with-the-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2038112","commentId":2038112,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1454860428,"content":"12705722_10206100454573748_7506088839930 [https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xlf1/v/t1.0-9/12705722_10206100454573748_7506088839930631916_n.jpg?oh=ae468fc8ca9ccddda295ad589d6577ca&amp;oe=573C60F9]12662624_10206100455373768_3247897794452 [https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/12662624_10206100455373768_3247897794452640593_n.jpg?oh=d74fd830bb600f19fa6f74960736776f&amp;oe=5725FE4E]12670083_10206100456173788_1357353045705 [https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/12670083_10206100456173788_135735304570541976_n.jpg?oh=39bc0ed1fa1214150e5ecbe3040d1d8c&amp;oe=572AC19F]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201432-where-is-the-man-with-the-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2038115","commentId":2038115,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1454860637,"content":"I was hoping there wouldn't be some great Noldor cards so I could ignore this cycle.\n\n \n\n:( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201432-where-is-the-man-with-the-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2038116","commentId":2038116,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1454860867,"content":"Some great stuff!

I think it will be really helpful in 2-player setups where one player is handling the majority of Questing while the other is handling the combat (which is probably the most common 2-player setup I see). Sometimes the Encounter Deck is going to throw out more threat then you are prepared for on the flop while you may not need all your Attack on the other side of the table--this is a perfect way to get use out of those characters and get some progress down.
