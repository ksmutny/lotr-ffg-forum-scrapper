And same goes for having less than three copies of a card in a deck, it just makes things random and you might as well not have the card in a deck at all, unless you produce some crazy drawing, you're not going to get through more than one third of your deck.

For example a card like Beorn that costs 6 resources may be better as a two of because he's so expensive. Unless you are running some form of resource generation he can be difficult to get out, therefore you wouldn't want to bank on being able to draw and play him every game. However if you only had one or two copies, he can come out every now and then as an added bonus."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56269-deck-size/?do=findComment&comment=557317","commentId":557317,"userName":"Bungo_Underhill","timestamp":1321601302,"content":"silverhand77 said:\n\nI wouldn't say that having less than three copies of a card in your deck is a bad thing.

Sometimes it can be a fine line between having enough copies of a card in your deck so that you see it and have the opportunity to play it and whether or not you will actually get to play it often enough to make it a viable part of the deck, especially when there are other cheaper and easier to play cards that you might include instead."}]}
