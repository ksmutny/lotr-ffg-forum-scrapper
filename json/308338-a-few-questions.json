My quest cards say Along, but the core rulebook says Down...\n\nAs you pointed out, it is called both.\n\nPersonally, because the Wilds of Rhovanion quest is called Journey Up the Anduin, I've finally settled on calling the core set quest Journey Down the Anduin for symmetry's sake. YMMV."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308338-a-few-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3937840","commentId":3937840,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1589212690,"content":"Balrog will only enter play as a result of his Forced effect at the end of the quest phase, you're right.\n\nAnd if you manage to rush rush rush and finish the scenario before he comes out, you only have to choose two burdens.

Doom, Doom, Doom says:Â \n\nShadow.Â Â Â Flame.Â Â \n\nForced: At the end of the quest phase, remove 1 damage token from Doom, Doom, Doom. Then, if there are no damage tokens here, add The Balrog to the staging area. Forced: At the end of the quest phase, The Balrog makes an attack if it is in play.\n\nÂ \n\nSo... if there are no tokens (because they got removed via card effects), you FAIL to remove one via the Forced effect right? Then, the \"then\" clause shouldn't fire.... And the Balrog should never enter play, right? What am I missing?Â \n\nÂ "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308338-a-few-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3937891","commentId":3937891,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1589216537,"content":"I wanted to point this out as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308338-a-few-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3938005","commentId":3938005,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1589228378,"content":"That was addressed inÂ this thread, [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134548-doom-doom-doom-card-from-the-road-darkens-official-errata/]Â which amusingly features GrandSpleenÂ ðŸ˜€\n\nEdited May 11 by NathanH"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308338-a-few-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3938019","commentId":3938019,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1589229620,"content":"Hah!
