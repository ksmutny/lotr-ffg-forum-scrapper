Let's look at the obvious comparisons:\n\n \n\nErkenbrand vs Beregond: Beregond has better raw defense and tailormade attachments, but Erkenbrand is great for shadow cancellation. He makes a better mid-range defender, and can cancel shadows anywhere, not just for attacks against him. That makes chump blocking a lot less risky and turns Erkenbrand into a nice centerpiece of the overall defensive strategy. Still needs some healing in the deck and defense boosts.\n\n \n\nWarden vs. Defender of Ramas: Warden is more expensive but gets sentinel and leadership can afford it. Either is good in its sphere.\n\n \n\nDay's rising: Cool to have something that interacts with Sentinel rather than ranged. I see this on Beregond or either Aragorn rather than Erkenbrand. Also a nice boost to pass to the other player in multiplayer: leadership has better resource accelleration but for tactics or lore this could be great.\n\n \n\nDon't be hasty: Interesting little card.

There are what 4? characters in the entire game with a defense of 4 or more. I think you need to reacquaint yourself with the definition of mediocre.\n\n \n\nQuantifying cards in the vacuum of what sphere they're in is utter nonsense. Leadership has no usable scrying to check on shadow cards, so you arguing that it's just as likely the new shadow will be better is exactly the same as someone arguing the new one will be bad, ie pointless. With Erkenbrand there are no variables, everything you need to make the decision to use his ability is right in front of you the whole time, there's no randomness to account for. How is that worse/inferior to rolling the dice on a maybe? We've already agreed it's less flexible, that's not in dispute, dismissing it as inferior seems hasty if not outright stupid."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1375870","commentId":1375870,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1419200157,"content":"> I'm very intrigued by your comments Dan.

I see him working in a more traditional-style deck, because he allows Rohan to have a defender. Lately, I am especially interested in pairing Rohan with Gondor and Warden of Healing makes Erkenbrand's drawback not really a problem. It is also worth noting that Captain of Gondor works on Erkenbrand, as anti-thematic as that might seem. Built-in sentinel should not be underestimated, this allows other decks to worry less about combat and focus on other facets of the game.\n\n \n\nI don't have a specific deck for Erkenbrand yet, but I am confident that he will end up being a pillar in a new Gondor/Rohan cooperation archetype. The Rohan leaves play deck is a completely different style than this hero, and at this point I don't feel that archetype needs any more help. Once I was able to kill 3 enemies in the same round using only Éomer I was sold on that deck being legitimate. Now I am interested to see different decks based on Rohan characters. It should also be mentioned that actually defending with Erkenbrand has another advantage in that it avoids the recent encounter card hate against chump blocking."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1375923","commentId":1375923,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1419202164,"content":"Sounds cool!

In a mono lore deck that has trouble questing early on, 3 of these could be crucial.

The Day's Rising and Captain of Gondor both work really well on Erkenbrand and Beregond. All the other sentinel defenders have 2 or less defense, and Theoden is the only other character that has sentinel AND warrior. There are plenty of decent options for Captain of Gondor, but not many that can use both of these. The Day's Rising can fail on Erkenbrand a bit more often because of his ability and because of have 1 less defense, but I still think there are plenty of chances to get it to work and it's always nice to have more resource generation.\n\n \n\nI would argue with MNT that Erkenbrand's ability is worse than Balin's, but it's certainly not something that would prevent me from playing him.\n\n \n\nCaptain of Gondor is amazing and the only thing I'd like better is if it wasn't unique so I can use it on more than one character. (I'd make it limit one per character; It's just wishful thinking though :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] )\n\n \n\nIt kinda sucks that you have to pay 3 for a halfway decent defender ally, but 3 is a balanced cost for the Warden of Helm's Deep, and you should be able to afford it. An ally with 3 defense and 2 hit points can be pretty useful.\n\n \n\nIt sucks that Booming Ent starts with 2 fewer stats than Wandering Ent, but he has some pretty good potential for a lot more stats.\n\n \n\nI'm surprised by the fact that anyone can use Ride Them Down: no mount or Rohan requirement.

That seems like a much more common occurrence to me. I don't see how MNT sees this as similar to Late Adventurer when it removes characters from questing instead of adding them. I can see where it can have a similar outcome of saving a character from the devastation of a treachery, but by doing the opposite.\n\n \n\nWaters of Nimrodel has a ridiculously powerful ability, but it also seems over-priced to me. The effect deserves the price but how many people can afford 3 Lore resources and 3 threat? Also, it's pretty rare that I end up having enough damage distributed to my characters to make it worthwhile. Of course, you can build the deck around high HP allies and Heroes so you can make better use of the card, but I don't think I'd ever include 3 copies.\n\n \n\nAnd of course Treebeard is just awesome and sits as a cross being OHaUH Gandalf and Radagast."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1375994","commentId":1375994,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1419204840,"content":"It's simple.

No matter how you slice it, every single time you use Balin's ability you run the risk of leaving your board state worse than if you had not used it at all.\n\n \n\nI'm completely aware there you can use Balin's ability on more than 1 attack per turn, but that still doesn't change any of the above. Erkenbrand's strength is that at all points of the exchange the outcome is predictable, I've already said, twice, it's less flexible than Balin's, it's not however \"inferior\".  There's a few ways you can get more than 1 use out of Erkenbrand's ability (Stand Together and Hama, any readying effect, Eomund and Westfold Horse-Breaker if you want to keep a Rohan theme), all he needs is some healing to support him, which is no different than adding resource acceleration to support Balin.  It's a different approach, not a worse one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1376036","commentId":1376036,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1419206849,"content":"If Erkenbrand uses his ability and still dies - you're down ENTIRE HERO.

If Balin uses his ability to replace a shadow card for another defending hero and the hero still dies it's the exact same bloody outcome.  How is that MUCH worse than Erkenbrand dying??? Ridiculous\n\n \n\nBalin replacing a shadow and the ONLY bad thing is a second \"boardwide bad shadow\"??? Hyperbole!  Your luck must be so phenomenal if that's the case maybe you should quit LCG's and stick to the casinos?  \n\n \n\nErkenbrand needing some readying/healing is completely justified and necessary.  He completely negates the shadow, if he had no caveats stronger than throwing away resources it would break the game. It's an incredibly powerful ability sitting on the board from turn one, unlike waiting around for a Hasty Stroke.\n\n \n\nSorry I just don't see how NO shadow card being worse than MAYBE shadow card makes any logical sense.\n\n \n\n\"It's a different approach on the same kind of question - dealing with shadows, no matter what you say.\"  I'm pretty sure that's exactly what I said at the end of my previous post"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1376119","commentId":1376119,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1419211111,"content":"Erkenbrand and Balin each have there own pros and cons.

You all will most likely have a chance to play it before I do. I really wish I had time to play it through at least once, but I just didn't have the time. The location that came out was the \"Raven war camp\" I believe. I can't remember the time effect on it, but I feel like it might have dealt damage to characters. I could be completely wrong on that though.

If it's an attachment, it would only allow you to use the ability with that specific character (that's how I would make it, otherwise attachment doesn't make sense), so it has another fundamental weakness over the event.

We tend to think that more cards = more options, and while that is true, if we want to prevent power creep, we'll always end up introducing \"duds\", not because the \"dud\" is bad, but because there are too many good cards and the \"dud\" will never butt them out. I'm glad player cards don't come out any faster than they do. I'm lucky if I get to try out 30% of a cycle's cards, and I'd love to try somewhere around 90% of them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1399050","commentId":1399050,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1420818996,"content":"The biggest benefit I see in Don't Be Hasty is that it targets any character in play.  Late Adventurer is limited to characters you control.  This allows DBH to be a useful component of a support deck.  The ability to save another player's character from a nasty treachery or ready an emergency defender while allowing other players to focus their decks could be huge.  Though of course this is situational.  I'm just not so down on this card as I was when I first read it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1401268","commentId":1401268,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1420970958,"content":"DBH is not too bad. It's situational, true, but it makes decision making easier. Avoiding treacheries is only half of the story, and IMO not very important when you look at the current treachery cards. Keeping the balance between questing and fighting is far more important, and here is it where DBH is shining.\n\n \n\nImagine the following scenario: you're playing The Antlered Crown and you're at stage 2. You wanna make it through as quickly as possible, so send all your characters to the quest. However, you draw a nasty enemy from the encounter deck you is going to attack you this round. Fortunatly you can play DBH to call back one of your adventurers to block that enemy.\n\n \n\nThat's the reason why I think DBH is better than Late Adventurer. You can keep DBH in your hand until you desperatly need it, and meanwhile you can send one extra character to the quest. Late Adventurer can do this only once, and then it is gone."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1406028","commentId":1406028,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1421246556,"content":"Finally got around to playing the scenario. It's pretty cool. I played Eowyn, Eomer, Imrahil with a similar deck to what i used at start of VoI. Since this scenario used the same encounter sets as the First scenario in VoI. Lots of card draw hate.\n\ni lost in first attempt, but it was close. Modified my deck a bit and then won the second time, but it was still down to the wire. Overall I was satisfied with the challenge, but a second attempt victory makes it probably the least challenging of any final cycle scenario we have had.\n\nTons of time effects in this one for quest cards and locations. Once locations are cleared out of the staging area things get much easier. The first few rounds of the scenario are the most difficult. I liked that the boss could jot be engaged until the unique location is explored or otherwise he could be taken out almost immediately. It took 12 rounds to beat and it felt like i had to work for it.\n\nI like the deck i used on it, and wonder how other deck will fair.\n\nIn terms of the time mechanic, it's okay, but i think it adds to much extra in game tracking which pulls me further away from the theme of the game. The game already is quite heady, and triggering all the time effects became a bother after awhile. I'll be happy if this mechanic is used infrequently in the future."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1406232","commentId":1406232,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1421255213,"content":"Great to hear that you had fun, Tracker1!\n\nAs for your last note, I think they added too much time.. Time on every single quest and in this scenario like almost every location. If they did it on a less regular basis and made it even more punishing to let Time X trigger, imo it would have been more of a 'wow' effect and it would give you more the feeling of being on a hurry. In VoI it was done pretty okay, but further down the line it's less exciting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1408489","commentId":1408489,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1421377010,"content":"So finally got my hands on The Antlered Crown and played a single game last night which I won.\n\nI actually really like the quest and the way it has been designed but it is definitely the easiest of the final quests for each cycle with even Return to Mirkwood being harder with its threat gains of 8, instant 4 damage to heroes (gollums bite) and multiple copies of both Attercop, Attercop and Hill Troll. I actually found it easier than The Fords of Isen which uses two of the same encounter sets but features much more hand/drawing cards hate. \n\n \n\nI managed to utterly demolish the quest after some particularly nasty starting turns in which I ended up with 3 damage on Glorfindel, 2 damage on Elrond, 3 damage on Celeborn and 2 on Elladan due to Dunlending Battlefields time effect triggering whilst both decks had 5 cards in their hand. With first turn Asfaloth I was able to consistently keep locations under control and only had one location time effect trigger throughout the whole game and only because of a particular treachery appearing more than once. Stage 2 I was able to clear before the time effect triggered (only 1 counter was left) and stage 3 I cleared before time ran out as well (finished it with only one counter remaining). The Raven Chieftain only attacked once (feigned voices was used the other time) and there was no active location (had just cleared Raven Chieftains Camp) so he didn't remove any time counters. I managed to avoid enemies being revealed from the Raven deck pretty much every time I could and only had the two that are added to staging at the start of the game, the two that come out due to the effect of stage 2 and the one that comes out (playing two handed) due to the effect of stage 3 enter play at all (so the minimum amount). \n\nI used two test of wills at crucial moments to minimize direct damage effects and also used two hasty strokes (one saved a hero from dying).\n\nI managed to defend against an 8 attack Dunlending Bandit and Elrohir lived through it (6 armour from shield and steward and cloak of lorien and then no shadow effect so only 2 damage). \n\nI also managed to kill TWO Raven Warriors the same way by attacking them with Haldir while in staging (both decks had low enough threat to just leave them in staging both times) who had 6 attack (dunedain mark and bow of the galadhrim) and then doing the final point of damage with a Galadhon Archer BOTH times who only cost 1 tactics resource each time thanks to O Lorien. Completely avoided their when engaged effects. \n\nI also even explored the Raven Chiefs Camp before the time effect could trigger. I also removed two very nasty condition attachments the turn they appeared with power of orthanc removing two instead of one which is normally the case and doing so before either of them could trigger a single time (one of which would have put the final point of damage on at least one hero if not more).\n\n \n\nShortly after the second turn and having all the damage on heroes stack up from the single location time trigger in the game (Dunland Battlefield) I had to take an undefended attack of 2 damage and Haldir also got left on a single hitpoint. I thought for SURE I was going to lose with all the damage on heroes and no healing in sight. Somehow even though I didn't draw a Warden of Healing until the third last turn and even though this quest has lots of direct damage effects I still managed to utterly crush it and pull off all that is mentioned above and then some. Probably one of the best games I've ever had to be completely honest, after the horrible start and the single undefended attack I had to take almost everything changed immediately and I managed to handle everything that appeared and quickly clear the staging area and kill all enemies. Two PERFECTLY timed Test of Wills stopped further direct damage leading to an instant loss. Several combat strategies (especially the way I dispatched both Raven Warriors) including Haldir taking enemies out before they could attack and well timed Feigned Voices allowed me to devastate the Dunlending Douchebags. Asfaloth alone kept locations well and truly under control. \n\nEpic and very fun game but now I'm just annoyed I can't even log it yet and have to add it to my list of games I need to eventually log for Old Forest and Barrow Downs  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"}]}
