So, an effect that instructs you to search for an enemy, reveal it, and add it to the staging area will not trigger Thalin's ability.\n>   Cheers, Caleb\"\n> \n> This response led to a lot of discussion and I thought I would ask some follow up questions to try to better under the scope, particularly for cases where the player has no control over the selection of the card being revealed.\n> \n> For all of these questions, suppose that Thalin has been committed to a quest and no effect has removed him the quest.\n> \n> Question 1) If an encounter card is revealed with the surge keyword, then by the core rules we are told to \"reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck\". If this additional card is an enemy, does Thalin's ability apply?\n> \n> Question 2) What if an encounter card has an effect that states \"Reveal a card from the encounter deck\" (for instance, Massing at Night from the Core set). Would Thalin's ability apply to any enemies that were revealed in this manner?\n>  \n> \n> Question 3) What if a quest stage is completed (during the quest phase, so heroes are still committed to the quest) and the next stage states to reveal one or more card from the encounter deck (for example, Journey Down the Anduin 3B: Ambush on the Shore). Would Thalin's ability apply to any enemies that were revealed?\n> \n> Thanks in advance.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nCaleb's Response:\n\n> Hi Richard,\n> \n> Thanks for following up with me.\n> My ruling with regard to Thalin was based on the use of the language “by the encounter deck” as opposed to the more prevalent phrase “from the encounter deck.” A strict reading of the core rules makes it seem encounter deck only reveals 1 card per player during the staging step. However, after reviewing other player card effects that use the language “by” and “from” the encounter deck, it seems clear to me that both words were used to mean the same thing from the beginning of the game.\n> Therefore, I am changing my answer to the question that sparked the debate to say that Thalin’s ability will trigger against each enemy revealed “by” or “from” the encounter deck while he is committed to the quest. This includes enemies that are revealed by a surge effect or through card effects that instruct you to search “the encounter deck and discard pile” for that enemy. Essentially, the phrases “by the encounter deck” and “from the encounter deck” should be taken to mean any card that originated from the encounter deck or discard pile.\n> Some exceptions to this rule would be:\n> - Enemies that were previously set aside and revealed during the quest phase\n> - Enemies that are revealed from some other deck (i.e. the Underworld deck in The Steward’s Fear)\n> I will make a note to add this rules clarification to the next FAQ.\n> Cheers,\n> Caleb\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nFinal thought: I like it much better this way as it is simple and consistent.  "}]}
