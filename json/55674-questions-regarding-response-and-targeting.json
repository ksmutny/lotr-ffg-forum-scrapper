You cannot wait.\n\n \n\n\"When a Son of Arnor or Dunhere want to Attack an enemy in the Staging Area does that enemy also receive their usual Attack and Shadow Card or not?\"\n\nNo. The enemy does not get to attack nor do they receive a shadow card.\n\n \n\n\"The Forest Spider has a Forced Effect that reads something like \"When the enemy is engaged...it gains a +1 to Attack...\" or something similiar to that.

If it's the latter then what's the point of the effect? Why not simply give it NO effect and an Attack of 3?\n\nI appreciate everyone's help!\"\n\nThe Forest Spider gains +1 attack any time it is engaged. When a player engages an enemy the enemy is still said to have engaged the player (this is straight from the rules). This +1 to attack is ONLY for the turn it engages though.

According to the card text, Son of Arnor allow you to choose an enemy card in the staging area or currently engaged with another player and engage that enemy. Usually you play your allies in the Planning phase, so the enemy will get its attack later on in the Combat Phase. To avoid the attack of the enemy, you would need the Son of Arnor entering play after enemy attacks (e.g. with the use of Sneak Attack).\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55674-questions-regarding-response-and-targeting/?do=findComment&comment=550657","commentId":550657,"userName":"LEGA","timestamp":1320227816,"content":"Svenn said:\n\n\"The Forest Spider has a Forced Effect that reads something like \"When the enemy is engaged...it gains a +1 to Attack...\" or something similiar to that.

Will Spider have 3 attack at the next round or 2?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55674-questions-regarding-response-and-targeting/?do=findComment&comment=550674","commentId":550674,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1320229512,"content":"@ShadowGhost\n\nYou are correct. Son of Arnor only allows you to engage an enemy and not attack them. Once engaged that enemy works as a normal engaged enemy.\n\n@LEGA\n\nIt doesn't matter if it attacks or not. The +1 attack expires at the end of the round. There is no requirement that it must attack in order for this to resolve. Feint would be a good way to avoid the 3 attack power Forest Spider. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55674-questions-regarding-response-and-targeting/?do=findComment&comment=550689","commentId":550689,"userName":"Valyrian Steel","timestamp":1320230431,"content":"Also a point of clarification, I believe Aragons response would be played immediately after her commits to the quest and not at the end of the questing phase.
