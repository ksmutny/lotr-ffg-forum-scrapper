Being able to discard locations and enemies from questing succesfully on the stage 3 cards helps somewhat in countering this. Also engaging enemies during staging with the stages special effect also helps offset this. It is hard but I was able to overcome it just."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125107-4b-of-3rd-quest-of-road-darkness/?do=findComment&comment=1304106","commentId":1304106,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1413669167,"content":"Mmmmh, another question about this scenario:\n\nEach player must resolve first his quest phase before passing the starting of quest phase of next player?\n\nIn Foundations, each player reveals his cards, and just after, each player resolve their quests.\n\nNow, it seams, each player must do his starting of quest pahse and resolving step before the next player starts his quest phase, maybe i'm wrong?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125107-4b-of-3rd-quest-of-road-darkness/?do=findComment&comment=1304158","commentId":1304158,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1413676060,"content":"Nope, not wrong. In player order, do the commiting step, staging step and quest resolution in one go.
