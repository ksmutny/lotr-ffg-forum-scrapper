Not a normal deck, but a deck with one copy of each player card in the game (excluding boons and treasures), just to see how much there are. I can't publish it because it says: \"Contains too many copies of a card (by title)\".\n\nI searched the deck and I obviously found two Gandalfs, Bofurs and Anborns but that isn't ilegal. I dont believe there too much player cards since the deck has got less than 500 cards on it and Seastan's Horn of Gondor combo deck has got more than 80.\n\nI don't know what to do..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221594-weird-problem-in-ringsdb/?do=findComment&comment=2246768","commentId":2246768,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1464894160,"content":"Do you have allies that match your heroes?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221594-weird-problem-in-ringsdb/?do=findComment&comment=2247263","commentId":2247263,"userName":"Sorcerious","timestamp":1464904634,"content":"It's bound to be something like that... If you're adding every card in the game, there are very few heroes who also haven't got an ally version (maybe if you combined Beravor, Eleanor and Brand son of Bain).
