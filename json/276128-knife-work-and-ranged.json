B has been targeted by Knife-work plus the kicker. A has an engaged enemy.\n\nNow A declares an attack against the enemy. B joins in with a Ranged character. The enemy dies. Does B draw a card?\n\nKnife-work is worded \"…each time he attacks and destroys an enemy this phase.\" Does this apply:\n\n* to B's character, in which case has he should draw a card in the posited situation, or\n\n* to B the player, in which case he did not declare the attack, so arguably he shouldn't draw a card…?\n\nIn other words, should the \"he attacks\" be interpreted as \"he participates in an attack\" or \"he declares an attack\"?\n\nEdited May 17, 2018 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276128-knife-work-and-ranged/?do=findComment&comment=3336331","commentId":3336331,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1526589023,"content":"In the example above, the targeted player would draw."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276128-knife-work-and-ranged/?do=findComment&comment=3338264","commentId":3338264,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1526679787,"content":"To me it should be interpreted as \"the player declare an attack\".

Then, the players as a group may spend 2 Lore resources to have the chosen player draw 1 card each time he attacks and destroys an enemy this phase."}]}
