It is quite difficult sometimes to interpret the exact meaning of the cards.

Does the +1 count if the player decides to engage the Forest Spider, or only if the Forest Spider engages the player? The spider says +1 when engaging the player, and the rules say the player may engage one enemy each turn, so the wording sounds to me like you can avoid the +1 if you choose to engage the spider, which seems thematically consistent as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111575-forest-spider/?do=findComment&comment=1217615","commentId":1217615,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1408652431,"content":"Whether or not you choose to engage the spider, it is still engaging you and the +1 still triggers.  Some other encounter cards say \"if you do not optionally engage...\" which would be the case you are describing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111575-forest-spider/?do=findComment&comment=1227734","commentId":1227734,"userName":"jimjim19681968","timestamp":1409141431,"content":"A further forest spider question.\n\n \n\nThe forest spider engaged me and I sent it back to the staging area with an event card.\n\n \n\nHe then re-engaged me.
