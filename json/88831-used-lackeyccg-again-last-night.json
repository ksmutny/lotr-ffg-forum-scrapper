I remember downloading it when it was still in it's early stages and getting frustrated with different things like shadow cards and shuffling discard piles back into their respective decks. \n\n \n\nI have to say that I feel way more comfortable using this tool to play with friends on the other side of the country than I did when I first tried it. Also I like the Censored/Uncensored cards. That way we can use all the latest cards and quests just as long as you have the reference cards.\n\n \n\nOverall I am excited about taking my board game hobby to the next frontier.  Space...err the interwebs. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88831-used-lackeyccg-again-last-night/?do=findComment&comment=845288","commentId":845288,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1377011882,"content":"Hmmmm maybe i should try it again since is only one on mac"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88831-used-lackeyccg-again-last-night/?do=findComment&comment=846050","commentId":846050,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1377074829,"content":"I never heard of Lackey....I am currently using OCTGN and am also very happy whit it.

The maker of the LotR LCG plugin for Lackey does and has great respect for FFG.\n\nBesides I was green with envy because I only have Mac. Finally I went through the trouble to install windows and finally getting to try octgn. My feelings compared with lackey? Meh. Greater layout maybe, but that's about it. Prefer a program that lets you play online AND solo if you want to without a lot of complications. Oh, and if the rumors are true Lackey is around the corner for appearing on iPad. I still want to see it before I believe it but it's way closer than octgn is. Also, the card scams for the lackey plugin is way better than the octgn are. I had to use some images for a third program, CardWarden for iPad, and took images from octgn at first. Seriously, I couldn't read the card text on some of the quest cards. It was just terrible."}]}
