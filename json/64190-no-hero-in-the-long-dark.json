Much like Ewyon his abilities are simply not relevant for the majority of the game. While having a hero that can one shot most monsters is great.. you might have noticed that a fully powered up Gimli is way way way over powered. Many of his hits are not being used. If you are combining him with a range character form another team for example.. say Legoas he is hitting for 5 from turn 1.. 6 if you have Dain out. Add a simple blade or axe and we have him hitting say 8. This is of course with out even having a plate and a bunch of wounds.\n\nMy point is that you can run other heroes that have effects much more beneficial for longer right to the end game.. if you run Gimli a lot I am sure you have noticed that you end up with way way more attack power than is needed for most turns. This is a waste. So look to other heroes that have ubr game constant effects… Dwalin for example… he also hits for 6 on turn one with ranged support….\n\nAnd finally Legoas …I'm not going to say that he is crap.. but Brand owns him in almost all ways. There are a few deck archetypes that require Lego.. and yes he is a good card… but Brand defends better, Brand quests better, and has a more relevant effect. He dose have more threat, but I feel that the ability of Lego really works against you if you are not drawing mobs.

It's out there 1-3 turns, depending on when you draw it and how many copies you get. Stand and Fight lets you up that count sometimes, but not every game. \n\nMapmaker is resource-intensive. If you are paying the cost to up his willpower, that means you're not playing other lore cards with him. They're just dead cards in your hand, and sometimes you are going to want to have those on the table more than you are going to want to have a higher willpower from Mapmaker (even when you desperately need it).\n\nIn a multi-player game, I would agree that Eowyn is a \"training wheels\" card, but in solo play she is a requirement if you want to overcome the quest area. She minimizes the number of characters you need to send on the quest each round. Sometimes, it's nice to know I only have to send her so that I can engage and fight off more enemies with my other characters. I have tried running other spirit heroes in her place, and every time I have compared my results from round to round to what they would have been if she had been on the team instead. In every instance, without exception. I have wished I had run her instead. I had many rounds where my threat increased 2-4 points but wouldn't have had she been questing instead.

Brand shouldn't be questing, and I did mention the \"Quest by Death\" deck archetype as being unique to Lego. BUT it only works if you are regularly drawing mobs. That deck can completely fail if you either draw nothing or if you draw stuff you can not deal with in a one-shot. While Brand augments other cards though untap.

It says so right on the box. They design the game to be able to be played in all modes.. This isn't even something to discuss.. it is like making a massive post to explain to us that water is wet.\n\nThe question is …\n\nCan the game design truly support solo, 2player, 3 player and 4player all at the same time.. and support all modes equally.? The answer is no.. no it can't.\n\nAny board game player will be very aware of the problem called scaling. This means that the game goes out of balance the more or less players (in this case) you add or subtract. Scaling gets its naming from the idea of going out of balance and inherently implies that there IS a balance to go out of balance in the first place… An optimal setup for the game. In Arkham Horror you can play solo, this is a supported game mode.. there is even rule variants in the official rules to handle it.. BUT can anyone really sit here and say a single investigator is the optimal setup for Arkham Horror?… no.. absolutely not. …. in for this particular game, LoTRlcg , it is 2 players.\n\nNo one is saying solo is not fun, or there will nvr be a solo orientated quests or w/e…. … what I am saying, though, is that 2 player is the most balanced of all the modes, and this can not be some random accident… when they design cards they design for 2 player.. sure, they take into consideration solo and 3/4 player.. but it is for 2 player games that the cards get designed for at 1st consideration.\n\nSupporting other format is not the same as designing for it.

Where I take issue is that they promote the product as being for 1 player as well. It's really not.\n\nWhen I play with another person, I use the deck that I also run in solo games. The deck has an 80-90% win ratio against any particular scenario. When I play with another person, that player has to bring combat to handle the additional onslaught of enemies that I cannot. In fact, the assistant deck - as I have come to call it - is basically tactics with a lot of ranged so that I can pull an enemy and then my partner can help me kill it. That is his/her role.\n\nSo what this means is that when I am in solo mode, I'd better not run the assistant deck as the solo deck because I will lose. And do lose - I have tried to win solo with Tactics + another sphere multiple times and have come to the inevitable conclusion that it simply can't be done. Maybe down the road that will change - Hama was a great addition for Tactics in solo play - but they have a long way to go.\n\nI disagree with the assessment that a game can't be scaled properly for multiple players, starting with one player and going from there. I have about 50 suggestions. I think what has happened is that FFG severely underestimated how popular solo play would be in a board/card game and didn't develop this game correctly. As a result, half or more of all the player cards that come out with each pack are essentially wasted cardboard for people like me, who don't have a lot of free time with friends to spend sitting around the kitchen table hacking through a fantasy-based cooperative card game. The time I spend playing is usually after a long day at work when I am just getting home and needing to unwind. Would I like to be able to use ALL of the cards I PAID for when I play this game? Sure would! Is it realistic to do so?

I am not \"complaining\" that solo is unbalanced or that the quests are \"uber hard\" for solo players. As far as I'm concerned, this is only true of Escape from Dol Guldur. The 1B side of the first quest card might as well read: \"When Revealed: If you are the only player, you lose the game.\" But other than that I have beat every scenario at least once, and most of them multiple times. I can even kill both Hill Trolls in Journey to Anduin before they ever engage me almost every time. \n\nThat said, solo players do have a right to complain. We want the entire product that we are buying from them to be useable. I'm to the point that I am about to stop buying if the packs are as junky as the last 3 have been. From them, I have taken Arwyn Undomiel, Elrond's Counsel, and the Gondorian Warden and added them directly to my deck. I would love to use Word of Command but  I'm not making room for Rhadagast just to do that, and Gandalf is too unpredictable to bother with it. Maybe if/when they make more, it will be playable.\n\nI'd even go so far as to say that the Leadership and Tactics cards in the last 2 packs aren't any better than anything I already have in the assistant deck that I hand to my partner when I'm doing a 2-player game. The way I look at it, I paid $5 for the encounter pack and $1 a card for everything else I use. That is just too much IMO. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say the people in charge aren't doing as much playtesting as they should be. They probably don't have the time to do so adequately with a new pack coming out every single month."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64190-no-hero-in-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=635528","commentId":635528,"userName":"Boris_the_Dwarf","timestamp":1337866792,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nhaving played this since the beginning i can offer some insight on the problems you state above- the thing is you have to take a very different approach when playing solo….as i ve said ive never played any other way- however i still know mulitplayer strategies and support tactics- all this falls apart in solo\n\ni have had a lot of success solo- ive won against all scenarios (except guldur) - however you just have to accept a lower win ration than multiplayer\n\nnow onto the case of being able to use all cards- i reccomend you search for a topic i posted a while back in which i raised concern over some cards….im not going to repeat it as i was about torn apart by multiplayers and was even insulted on my income (dont ask)- however i shall give you a link when i find it\n\ntry here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=631266]\n\ni have to say that despite my post i linked there- i dont feel quite the same way now- id certainly say more than half are useful in each pack, in not often all of them\n\nas for sidetracking the thread- i think this one had ran its course anyways given we know there is indeed a hero happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\n\n\n \n\nI will definitely read that. I don't think a solo player has to accept a lower win rate. I think a solo player has to accept that the game becomes dull very quickly because you can only play the same basic deck over and over again if you want to do well. A lot of people don't get it from what I've seen on these boards, but questing is how you win, in general. Sure there are specific conditions along the way of each quest card - including sometimes killing an enemy - but if you can't overcome the staging area threat each round, you will lose no matter how many enemies you kill or how many allies you have. The first thing I would have done if I were a designer is I would have started the threat level of heroes lower, put willpower at a minimum of 3 instead of 0, and then required the first player to always be the first and last player to flip a card. What this means is that if another player flips an encounter card during the quest phase, then the first player must flip an additional card. I'm sure someone will disagree but IMHO that solves your scaling problems right there. Regardless, what's done is done."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64190-no-hero-in-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=635534","commentId":635534,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1337867100,"content":"well your opinion is certainly valid….… i just guess its a case of personal opinion\n\nnow myself personally….since early may last year ie 12 months ago- i have played many hundreds of games- an embarrising amount some might think- and i havnt got bored once- however this may be down to my strong love for tolkien and the theme- i get alot out of just looking at the artwork- this doesnt work for everyone- especially 'boromir' (likes to win if you werent around for the article) type players\n\ni also havnt got bored of different combos yet- now maybe this is down to me sticking with one type of deck for many games, maybe my 'pippin' side works a bit slower than everyone else- but either way, again its opinion based\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64190-no-hero-in-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=635765","commentId":635765,"userName":"Serazu","timestamp":1337918011,"content":"I always play solo too and, although I greatly appreciate richsabre, who is a real gentleman, in this case I have to agree with the majority or, at least, the majority in the last pages of the current topic: when I play solo, I really have no choice; it's either Spirit + whatever or defeat."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64190-no-hero-in-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=635774","commentId":635774,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1337921606,"content":"Serazu said:\n\nI always play solo too and, although I greatly appreciate richsabre, who is a real gentleman, in this case I have to agree with the majority or, at least, the majority in the last pages of the current topic: when I play solo, I really have no choice; it's either Spirit + whatever or defeat.\n\n\n\nwhy thank you sir happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\nnot that i want to change the topic of this thread into an advice thread…and im sure you'll have tried it anyways…but have you you given lore a shot instead of spirit? infact id go as far as saying i find it much easier to win with lore (using card draw and protector of lorien/ or big resource draw and map maker) than spirit\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64190-no-hero-in-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=635782","commentId":635782,"userName":"Serazu","timestamp":1337923357,"content":"Oh, yes, yes.

I will try to not get in this discussion again.. but seriously .. give it a try.\n\n\n \n\nI have, and it has always ended in disaster. I've even compared round to round what would have happened if I had run Eowyn instead of Frodo. Without exception, I have noted that I finish the quest faster with Eowyn, and more often than not, my threat skyrockets with Frodo on the team - this is not because of his ability, either; it's because I fall behind in questing very quickly. When you go from putting a token or 2 on the location card every round to having to raise your threat by 1-2 points every round, what happens is that you are not clearing the staging area. What it boils down to is that you need 1 quester, 1 blocker, and 1 attacker when choosing heroes. Obviously, it's nice if the heroes can do other things to, but those are the primary requirements. What role does Frodo play, exactly? Is he the blocker? Then who is the quester? Frankly, there's no one else that can quest as great as Eowyn, and certainly not at her threat cost. I'd rather tap down one character and hold the line on the quest stage than tap down 2-3 characters leaving me less to block and attack with, and then still not at least hold the line on the quest stage. \n\n1 game - the most memorable example - I compared round to round what would happen if I had kept Eowyn instead of Frodo. With Eowyn, I won the game in 5 rounds. My final threat was 20. (My starting threat was 24.) With Frodo, I lost the game in 12 rounds with a final threat of 39 (My starting threat, by the way, was 22). What was the difference? I couldn't keep pace on questing because I was having to fight too much stuff. Eowyn could hold the line, freeing up 2 other characters to block and attack. But with Frodo on the team it took everything to do what Eowyn was doing on her own, and I couldn't spare it for the 2 rounds I needed to clean-up the enemies that were engaging me. What was the quest, you ask? Passage to Mirkwood. The entry level adventure. I'll go get a sandwich while I let that sink in."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64190-no-hero-in-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=635960","commentId":635960,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1337948363,"content":"@lleimmoen - thats an intersting point you make - i was about to say at first 'cancellation is a spirit thing, it wouldnt go with any other sphere' but then i realised you're right- there are a good few shadow cancellation cards across the spheres! i think its because treachery cancellation is much more powerful in general\n\n@boris - thats also an interesting post- however i have noted the opposite! as soon as i ditched the rather lovely eowyn i started winning more….and i mean a whole lot more…..there are players who swear by her, and some hate her….i am about in the middle- i see her use, especially for solo as she opens up a slot for a fighter/defender, but i also see other just as good (or in my opinion better) strategies\n\n…for instance that 'slot' could be freed up by a unexpected courage hero, or a fast hitched (and buffed up with protector of lorien) hobbit, or again map maker with a ton of resources spent to buff him up to double eowyns base willpower…another favourite willpower killer of mine is dain, bifur and gloin, with a few dwarf allies….each one of them gettting dains +1 willpower really adds up\n\nthe draw back to my own plans are of course you have to buy them cards…thus alot of my games are slow to start then really take off"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64190-no-hero-in-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=635995","commentId":635995,"userName":"Boris_the_Dwarf","timestamp":1337951659,"content":"richsabre said:\n\n@lleimmoen - thats an intersting point you make - i was about to say at first 'cancellation is a spirit thing, it wouldnt go with any other sphere' but then i realised you're right- there are a good few shadow cancellation cards across the spheres! i think its because treachery cancellation is much more powerful in general\n\n@boris - thats also an interesting post- however i have noted the opposite! as soon as i ditched the rather lovely eowyn i started winning more….and i mean a whole lot more…..there are players who swear by her, and some hate her….i am about in the middle- i see her use, especially for solo as she opens up a slot for a fighter/defender, but i also see other just as good (or in my opinion better) strategies\n\n…for instance that 'slot' could be freed up by a unexpected courage hero, or a fast hitched (and buffed up with protector of lorien) hobbit, or again map maker with a ton of resources spent to buff him up to double eowyns base willpower…another favourite willpower killer of mine is dain, bifur and gloin, with a few dwarf allies….each one of them gettting dains +1 willpower really adds up\n\nthe draw back to my own plans are of course you have to buy them cards…thus alot of my games are slow to start then really take off\n\n\n\nWhat you say makes sense, but it's also different than boored's \"challenge.\" You can't just drop Eowyn for Frodo.
