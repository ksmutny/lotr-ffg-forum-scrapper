That would be awesome. But even still, the fact that you actually got 30 attack on him instead of just theorizing about it is pretty amazing. Nice job!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60623-megolas-legolas-with-attack-30/?do=findComment&comment=595906","commentId":595906,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1329623771,"content":" By this point I was on my third run through of the encounter deck trying to find Golum who has escaped.  I had every card in play from both decks.\n\nThe reason I tend to pile everything onto Legolas is because Brand is in the other deck, so if he helps Legolas destroy something, Legolas can ready again.\n\nI also had a fully equiped Bilbo in play with 3 Dunedain Warnings, Burning Brand, Fast Hitch, Protector of Lorien and Song of Mocking to shunt damage onto Frodo if needed.\n\nIt seems like power playing but actually both my decks are themed - One is Dunedains/Eagles and the other is Hobbit/Silvan."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60623-megolas-legolas-with-attack-30/?do=findComment&comment=596064","commentId":596064,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1329658933,"content":"scottindeed said:\n\nThe reason I tend to pile everything onto Legolas is because Brand is in the other deck, so if he helps Legolas destroy something, Legolas can ready again.\n\n\n\nBrand is a superstar isn't he.. BUT if your playing solo his effect dose nothing, it only triggers when attacking into somone elses staging area..so in a solo game he dose not have a untap effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60623-megolas-legolas-with-attack-30/?do=findComment&comment=596100","commentId":596100,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1329667007,"content":"scottindeed said:\n\nI also had a fully equiped Bilbo in play with 3 Dunedain Warnings, Burning Brand, Fast Hitch, Protector of Lorien and Song of Mocking to shunt damage onto Frodo if needed.\n\n\n\n \n\nBetter put the song on Frodo."}]}
