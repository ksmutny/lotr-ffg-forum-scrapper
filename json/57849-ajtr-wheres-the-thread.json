I write ONLY about solo play, for multi this may actually work sometimes\n\nYou need snowborn scout (leadership) and ride to ruin (spirit). Alternatively you can use multiple ride to ruin, riddermark finnest, but basically, you'll want to play leadership + spirit.\n\nThen you need a way to heal the eagle repeatedly. So you can either use Radagast or Glorfindel. If you play Glorfindel, your deck building possibilites are very limited solo . And your resources will be crippled (as you will need to pay 1 to heal eagle every turn). On the other hand, if you do not play Glorfindel, but Radagast, you have more space to breath with your hero lineup, but you now need 3 cards to pull off this \"great\" combo. And it will not happen much because your won't be drawing it consistently, some pieces will be missing all the time.\n\nAnd if it somehow happens, what will you get at best? Assuming you start healing eagle by turn 3, you can't really stop the clock ticking, you can just slow it a little bit. But not much, while you are still in stage 1, eagle will be getting beaten a lot by his wounds and by encounter deck and you won't be doing much progress because you will not want to move to stage 2.\n\nExploring Rhosgobel during stage 1 and healing eagle with Glorfindel / Radagast is a funny thing to do, but is very unreliable, does not help you much and designing deck over this will probably drop your chances against other quests.\n\nJust a remainder, all I wrote is about solo play. In multi, you have 6 heroes and 2 decks. It is much easier to design decks that take advantage of such tactic. The question is, wouldn't adding Shadows of the past be much easier to pull off and yet more effective?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57849-ajtr-wheres-the-thread/?do=findComment&comment=570172","commentId":570172,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1324482137,"content":"I don't think it is unreliable to explore Rhosgobel during stage 1.

You can't reduce Wilyador's threat and there are many treacheries and ahdow effects that jurt the mighty eagle. Perhaps if you have Beravor and Bilbo and Gléowine it might make sense to draw some more cards.\n\nI still wonder why they even made it possible to travel to Rhosgobel in stage 1.
