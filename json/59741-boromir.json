That way he is perfect to handle the Wargs - first he is able to defend against them. If the Wargs get a shadow effect while attacking Boromir, ready him, if they don't keep him exhausted.\n\n3) Raising your threat by one point is a good price for a higher flexibility of play. You don't have to plan for every possible worst case scenario, because you have Boromir's action to get an additional defender/attacker.\n\n4) He gets more valuable when you give him some attachments that boost his attack and defenive stats. Card synergy is a keyword when using Boromir.\n\n \n\nI don't say that he's perfect, Gimli is IMO still the tactics no 1, but he certainly can be a helpful ally (in certain scenarios (Wargs!)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59741-boromir/?do=findComment&comment=587001","commentId":587001,"userName":"goblin981","timestamp":1327906865,"content":" Oh I see.  Yeah that is pretty good."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59741-boromir/?do=findComment&comment=587019","commentId":587019,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1327908862,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\n2) His ability is an action and not a response, so you'll only use it when it's neccessary and you want to use it, unlike Aragorn or Price Imrahil.\n\nUuh, Responses are also optional, you do not have to use Aragorn or Imrahil effects.

Most of the times you pay a resource and then you draw a location and Aragorn spents your coin in some tawdry Elven tavern. In Boromir's case you only activate him when he's needed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59741-boromir/?do=findComment&comment=587204","commentId":587204,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1327930183,"content":"Oh I see what you meant now.
