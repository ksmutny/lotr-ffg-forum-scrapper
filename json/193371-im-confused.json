I've read that in order to access anything beyond the Adventure Packs for the core set, I have to buy the expansions and then I can play the Adventure Packs that coincide.\n\n \n\nI guess my question is...why?\n\n \n\nI see videos of people mixing all sorts of cards together so I'm not entirely sure why I would need to buy anything specific to make certain cards useable.\n\n \n\nCan someone please enlighten me? My wife and I are enjoying the game, and I know she would be happy with some of the cards I've read about but I want to better understand this so I can make smart purchases of things we want and can use."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193371-im-confused/?do=findComment&comment=1889584","commentId":1889584,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1447256429,"content":"Later adventure packs key off of encounter cards that are provided in expansion sets (Khazad-dum is required for Watcher in the Water, for instance)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193371-im-confused/?do=findComment&comment=1889601","commentId":1889601,"userName":"Bohrdumb","timestamp":1447256971,"content":"> Later adventure packs key off of encounter cards that are provided in expansion sets (Khazad-dum is required for Watcher in the Water, for instance).\n\n \n\nSo, some quests would be unplayable without having certain expansions?\n\n \n\nBut what about the players cards?
