When you flip the new quest card to side B, any \"when revealed\" effects resolve immediately. The only exceptions to this rule are the quest cards in Flight From Moria, which are not flipped over until the staging step during the NEXT round.\n\nAll of this takes place during the quest phase, so a character like Thalin will still damage any enemies revealed via quest card effects."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63206-question-on-quest-timing/?do=findComment&comment=620400","commentId":620400,"userName":"Thukam","timestamp":1334984338,"content":" So do Dol Guldur Orcs deal their damage if they are revealed during the movement from (X)B quest card to (X+1)B quest card?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63206-question-on-quest-timing/?do=findComment&comment=620401","commentId":620401,"userName":"Thukam","timestamp":1334984381,"content":" Ehm, from (X)B to (X+1)A, obviously"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63206-question-on-quest-timing/?do=findComment&comment=620411","commentId":620411,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1334985894,"content":" I don´t understand the question exactly I am afraid. \n\nIf the Orcs are revealed somewhere in the quest phase they deal damage.

Sometimes this change happens during combat phase (for instance if you are using Legolas, Blade or Gondolin or if you remove an enemy blocking the way - like the Troll in the Journey down the Anduin quest).\n\nIf the stage change happens at the end of quest phase, while you are putting progress tokens, are you still considering questing? Are your characters still committed to a quest? What about some enemy like Dol Guldur Orcs [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/dol-guldur-orcs-core] reveal as a consequence of the new quest card?
