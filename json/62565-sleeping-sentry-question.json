The answer has been that the defending player is the player with whom the enemy is engaged. I think this is also true for \"undefended attacks\": In that case, there is no defending character, but still a defending player.\n\nÂ \n\nGreetings,\n\nPete"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62565-sleeping-sentry-question/?do=findComment&comment=612410","commentId":612410,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1333301829,"content":"cheers that makes sense"}]}
