mean, Unexpected Courage certainly makes Dori better, but he makes practically every other Hero better as well, and most other heroes have something better to exploit than 1/2/2 and an exhausting effect that only is useful in *very* rare circumstances.  I'm looking for something that would make *Dori* useful relative to other heroes, and an out-of-sphere two-cost attachment you'd play on one of your other heroes instead isn't it.\n\n \n\nComplicating matters is that if it were *specifically* a Dori toy, it would've need to have been in Dori's pack.  So while this would make Dori more useful:\n\n \n\nTactics attachment cost 0 -- Dori's Courage.  Attach to Dori.  When Dori exhausts for a reason other than to quest, attack, or defend, ready him.\n\n \n\nIt's not an option.  That would finally make his lame ability useful, though, and help him in some other situations as well.  It'd even enhance his ally version who actually is already useful.  But too late for that.\n\n \n\nFurther, cards that are tied to one specific hero aren't terribly interesting, even though they're always useful for that specific hero.  What I want is something that helps out Dori a lot, but doesn't have to be used with Dori.  And that means synergy with his rarely-useful ability.\n\n \n\nSo his ability\n\n1) Exhausts after defender is declared\n\n2) Adds his defense to another hero's defense for one attack.\n\n \n\nThe edge case where this ability is useful is where you don't need Dori's attack or defense for anything, but you need to buff a hero defender to take some massive attack (or another player's hero when Dori's player has no enemies).  I see two angles:\n\n \n\n1) Get rid of the exhaust cost somehow.  Without the exhaust, Dori can buff a defending hero and still attack (making him solo-friendly), or potential buff multiple hero defenders in a multiplayer context.\n\n2) Give some extra benefit for adding defense.\n\n \n\nFor #1, something like this would really help Dori\n\nTactics 1 attachment -- Unexpected Valor.  When a Hero exhausts not to quest, defend, or attack, exhaust unexpected valor to ready him.\n\n \n\nThis makes Dori useful even in solo, and the attachment is in-sphere.  It's also extremely useful for other heroes with an exhaust ability (Beravor, Denethor, Elanor, Haldir, Galadriel, Merry), but most of the other heroes have once per round limitations and only Dori has the attachment in-sphere.  The attachment would also be handy for attachments that exhaust themselves and the hero, but again that's not repeatable and only in-sphere for Great Yew Bow.\n\n \n\nFor #2, something like this would be useful\n\nTactics event (cost 1?) -- Counter-stroke.  After a hero defends without taking damage, do damage to enemy equal to the hero's attack.\n\n \n\nWith that, Dori's loss of action advantage can be worth it, because by buffing the defense of a good *attacking* hero he can potentially enable substantial direct damage.  Suddenly Dori becomes useful in a Gimli deck, serving as a defender most of the time but enabling the occasional massive counter stroke.  But it's also a card that doesn't require Dori to be in play to be handy in a deck.  (Maybe it should be \"after a character defends\", though?)\n\n \n\nThe cards I like to see the most are the ones that are useful on their own, but also makes other cards not currently useful to be more generally useful.  And I see a binder hero as more tragic than a binder ally, event, or attachment.  Cards that synergize with binder cards expand the effective card pool by more than one card, and how cool is that?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196068-certain-cards-youd-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=1943596","commentId":1943596,"userName":"webslinger9","timestamp":1450463258,"content":">
