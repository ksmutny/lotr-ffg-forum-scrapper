Mind you, I'm specifically referring to the trilogy, because the game itself is centered around those times. One can argue about Glorfi's stand vs the Nazgul outside Rivendell, but this isn't enough to merit the \"Valour\" keyword.

Eat a ton of threat on turn 1 and just wipe out all the monsters. There could be a solo deck here that doesn't quest at all (practically). Threat reduction, token placers, blades etc etc. These high monster eDecks could lead to a entire new way to play. Doomed will also make a big play for solo, but in multiplayer there could be problems with how it effects the entire table.\n\nStill I think in multi-player Frodo looks like the fastest and most reliable way to have a single player hit 40 while having the other players quest and stay under. Whack a Battle + Mocking Song and you have some powerful wound absorption across the entire table, especially when you build with other absorb effects. Mocking isn't unique or limited in any way, you could have 3 on Frodo easy.\n\nNot been as excited for a set for a while, this new keyword is very exciting for the changes in deck building it is encouraging and unlike Secrecy it is much easier to hit the threshold. At first I thought it might lead to a drop in the need for as much threat reduction, but having 40 threat could make those reduction cards more important not less.\n\nEdited January 30, 2015 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133432-the-wastes-of-eriador/?do=findComment&comment=1428590","commentId":1428590,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1422662185,"content":"I am of the opinion that we will get a card or two that allows the Valour player to reduce or set their threat to 40.  The reason is that once you are at 40 you are only a couple of Doomed cards away from losing.\n\n \n\nOr perhaps a way to convert threat to damage?  That would be a twist."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133432-the-wastes-of-eriador/?do=findComment&comment=1428594","commentId":1428594,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1422662534,"content":"I'd be disappointed if there was a 40 reset of some sort.

I'm asking for a situational card. The Door is Closed is a great example.

Spheres should be \"balanced\" - in that they have approximately equal levels of power to affect the game in a positive manner and ensure victory.\n\n \n\nNow, there might be certain quests that favor a particular color, and spheres should be better/worse at certain things in relation to one-another... But saying \"things shouldn't be balanced\" is rather silly.\n\n \n\nLet's pretend that there are only two important parts to this game, Questing and Combat. It's very likely that Questing and Combat are not EQUALLY important in every quest and in every stage of the game.\n\n \n\nIf each compenent to the game has a particular coefficient based on how \"important\" it is, then each color should have a second coefficient that represents how good it performs that task.\n\n \n\nFor example, let's pretend that the game was actually extremely Combat-Orientated and there were only two parts to the game (obviously incorrect). 0.33*Questing + 0.67*Combat.\n\n \n\nThat means that two \"balanced\" spheres might have power coefficients of (3, 1) for Spirit and (1, 2) for Tactics. Even though Tactics is only twice-as-good as combat compared to Spirit, while Spirit is three-times-better than Tactics at questing, the actual strength of the two spheres are BALANCED.\n\n \n\nVersus \"homogenous\" where each Sphere has very similar power-coefficients for every single major part of the game.\n\n \n\n(Also, i do think it's sort of strange to say that Tactics doesn't actually have Shadow Card cancellation? Feint and Thicket of Spears. Sure, it doesn't work on Nightmare-Balrog or Sleeping Sentry on a Cave Bat, but...)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133432-the-wastes-of-eriador/?do=findComment&comment=1431568","commentId":1431568,"userName":"blackhathedgehog","timestamp":1422902464,"content":"> I understand the opinion that we shouldnt be blending the spheres.

Even \"strictly inferior\" cards are not a waste of cardboard. If there existed a different version of Test of Will that canceled a \"when revealed\" for 1 resource + 1 random discard, it would be worth running 3 copies of Test of Will + 3 copies of sh*tty Test of Will against certain quests.\n\n \n\nThis is even more-true when talking about different Sphere: In one-player mode, Dawn Take You All! is almost always a strictly inferior version of Hasty Stroke: it costs one more mana and only works on face-down shadow cards. (it can cancel \"uncancellable\" shadows like Nightmare Balrog, so it's not always strictly inferior).\n\n \n\nHowever, DTYA! exists in a sphere with greater access to resource acceleration, and its cards are generally budgeted at a higher cost than other spheres. Shadow-Card cancellation is also a \"tertiary\" power-budget for Leadership. It puts has primary/secondary budgets for resource-acceleration, AoE buffing/debuffing effects and ally-mustering.\n\n \n\nAnyway, the key part would be to give Tactics some sort of cancellation that fit its particular power-budget and themes. Giving them a Burning Brand would be rather inappropiate - espiecially in the context of Beregond.\n\n \n\nSimilarily, an Event might be a little abusable when it comes to Hama, since then you could have 6 \"Feints\" when combined with a good defending ally such as Defender of Rammas (though this would be less of a problem if it cost 2 resources).\n\n \n\nA probably more-thematic way of doing it would be a 2/3 resource ally that had a Burning Brand effect.

In any case, I think that if Tactics would have cancellation, it would sacrifice a character (like you did) or maybe a weapon attachment. I think discarding a weapon (or armor) attachment would be a great way to bring the power of the card down while still keeping it playable in many decks, though I'm not sure how you would justify it thematically.\n\nI also believe that a shadow cancellation card that limits itself to only working on a defender with 2 or less defense or requires discarding an (armor?) attachment from the defending character offers similar balance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133432-the-wastes-of-eriador/?do=findComment&comment=1433201","commentId":1433201,"userName":"blackhathedgehog","timestamp":1422988089,"content":"Sure.\n\n \n\nPart of that was just being a demonstration of how you can offer different tertiary abilities to spheres that also fit the theme of the decks...\n\n \n\nA semi-squishy Burning Brand defender would make a good blocker against enemy adds since you prevent the occasional Sleeping Sentry from a 1-attack minion.

You could have a 4 player game with all mono-Spirit decks and it would likely do alright. If you play 4-player, you are practically required to have at least on player playing heavy Spirit, otherwise you wont stand a chance because you wont have the cancellation and location control you need. This is not healthy. If you still want to let Spirit specialize in those things, then give a sphere or two a weaker/more restricted means of dealing with some of these effects.\n\nThis has nothing to do with my favorite sphere. This has everything to do with more balance between spheres. I don't think that cancellation really needs to be a specialty of Spirit since there is nothing about \"spirit\" that says \"cancellation\" to me. If anything, Lore should specialize in cancellation."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133432-the-wastes-of-eriador/?do=findComment&comment=1437494","commentId":1437494,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1423225112,"content":"I want to second Joezim007 in this and also, danpoage probably would.

In any case Elladan is a great example of why that attachment would be too strong for Tactics. Of course, you could a Limit to it by exhausting it or something, but even being able to use a Tactics card to lower your threat practically every turn is outrageous. Tactics should not have repeatable threat reduction"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133432-the-wastes-of-eriador/?do=findComment&comment=1441328","commentId":1441328,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1423482418,"content":"> Changing the subject a bit...\n> \n> But I was wondering, what does Ranger of Cardolan say?
