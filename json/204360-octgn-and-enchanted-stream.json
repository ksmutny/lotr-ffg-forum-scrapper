Click it, and you won't draw.\n\nIt may be useful for you to know in future that you can also lock cards on the table, which will prevent them readying and (in the case of heroes) gaining resources when you hit CTRL+N."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204360-octgn-and-enchanted-stream/?do=findComment&comment=2083400","commentId":2083400,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1457048663,"content":"Talking about OCTGN, is there a way to play solo two-handed here?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204360-octgn-and-enchanted-stream/?do=findComment&comment=2083414","commentId":2083414,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1457049285,"content":"There is - I've answered the two-handed question before in the comments on my blog so I'll just copy and paste my response from there:\n\n \n\nStart two copies of the OCTGN client. It’ll tell you another instance of OCTGN is already running, do you want to close it, obviously say no. DON’T log in. Start a game in one window, then go to the other and if you wait a bit you should see your own game appear and be able to join it.\nOnce in game, obviously you can do it by just switching between windows to control the different decks, but if you want to control everything from the one window as I do, after loading up the second deck in the second game window and taking a mulligan if you want to, you go back to the window you’re going to be using and right click to take control of each of the other deck’s heroes, its hand, its deck and its discard pile. You will then be able to control both decks from the one game window.\nHowever you must remember that if controlling everything from the same window, the second deck will not automatically draw a card when you ctrl+N, you have to do this manually. Also ctrl+N will not move the first player token, so you have to keep track of that yourself as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204360-octgn-and-enchanted-stream/?do=findComment&comment=2089601","commentId":2089601,"userName":"Daesthai","timestamp":1457385262,"content":"@wolframius @Pocketwraith [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/user/262787-wolframius/]\n\n \n\nThanks so much!!"}]}
