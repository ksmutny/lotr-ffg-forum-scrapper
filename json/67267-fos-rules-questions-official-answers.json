Once a hero is dead, it counts as dead for scoring unless a card effect brings it back into play as a hero card. If a hero becomes attached to a Nameless Thing, it has not been brought back into play as a hero.\n2. Yes. You are considered to be the only player in the game while you are at your own separate stage 4.\n3. Technically, you could make an argument that they do not apply. However, the intention of the rules was directed at resolving encounter cards and player card interaction (i.e. playing an event to heal my partner's characters); it was not meant to circumvent the uniqueness rule. Furthermore, once players are rejoined it creates a problem with multiple copies of unique characters in play (or thematically the idea of Faramir being in 2 places at once), so I would rule the uniqueness rule does still apply, and I will see about updating the FAQ to include this clarification.\n4. When I update the FAQ it will probably state that while separated players ignore other player cards \"except for uniqueness\" meaning that Elladan and Elrohir would lose their boosts until rejoined.\n5. If a player is eliminated at stage 4, that staging area is eliminated as well. The encounter cards would simply be discarded.\n6. A hero shuffled back into the deck is not dead unless the effect that shuffled him in the deck says he is dead. If that was your last hero in play, however, you would be eliminated from the game at that time.\n\nThe answers to 2,3,4,5 are as I expected.\n\nThe answers to 1 and 6 seem slightly contradictory as (6) states that the Lost and Alone hero is not dead, but (1) seems to imply that he is."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67267-fos-rules-questions-official-answers/?do=findComment&comment=656300","commentId":656300,"userName":"mason240","timestamp":1341923445,"content":" Cool, I will put that information up on the scenario page at lotrlcg.com [http://lotrlcg.com/pages/scenario.php?Scenario_Key=1018].\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67267-fos-rules-questions-official-answers/?do=findComment&comment=656310","commentId":656310,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1341925416,"content":"mason240 said:\n\n Cool, I will put that information up on the scenario page at lotrlcg.com [http://lotrlcg.com/pages/scenario.php?Scenario_Key=1018].\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nI like your site, especially the average encounter stats.

A hero shuffled back into the deck is not dead unless the effect that shuffled him in the deck says he is dead. If that was your last hero in play, however, you would be eliminated from the game at that time.\n\nThe answers to 2,3,4,5 are as I expected.\n\nThe answers to 1 and 6 seem slightly contradictory as (6) states that the Lost and Alone hero is not dead, but (1) seems to imply that he is.\n\n \n\n \n\nI have some follow-up Q&A that clarify a couple of points further:\n\nMy questions:\n\n \n\n1. When separated on stage 4 in multi-player, as you say each player counts as first and last player. But would you still pass the first player token back and forth in the refresh phase, even though this will have no in-game effect until the players are reunited?\n\n \n\n2. I am a little unclear about your answers to my questions (1) and (6) - is a hero considered to be dead once he has been reshuffled into the deck, or not?\n\n3. A separate question - the situation where Forest Snare has been attached to a Nameless Thing as a result of the action on Nameless Thing. I can't see any reason why the effect of Forest Snare (\"Attached enemy cannot attack\") would not apply in this situation. However, this seems a little silly. I suspect that what is needed is a ruling that cards attached to Nameless Thing by its effect are treated as if they are blank for all other purposes apart from their printed cost.\n\n \n\nCaleb's answers:\n\n1. You still pass the first player token. The rules specifically address this point.\n2. Under the heading \"Hit Points and Damage\" the rulebook explains that hero cards in the discard pile are not shuffled back into the deck or returned to hand by card effects, unless they specifically target hero cards in the discard pile. So, once a hero has been killed, it is considered dead until you play a card that specifically returns that hero to play.\n3. I like this question a lot because I think it's the beauty of card games when something unintended and fortuitous like this happens. There is absolutely no reason why a Nameless Thing that attaches a Forest Snare to itself should ignore the text on that Forest Snare. In other words, if you top-deck a Forest Snare with the Nameless Thing's text, then it cannot attack. I would laugh out loud in a game where that happened!\n\nMy further questions:\n\n\nI think we got our wires crossed regarding my question (2) - my questions are:\n\n(a) a hero who has been shuffled into the deck by Lost and Alone - is he considered \"dead\" for scoring purposes if he is still in the deck at game end? (I think your answer is \"no\")\n\n(b) a hero who has been shuffled into the deck by Lost and Alone and has then become attached to a Nameless Thing, and is still attached to a NT at game end - is he \"dead\" for scoring purposes? (again, I think your answer is \"no\")\n\nAlso, regarding the Forest Snare situation - I understand your ruling, but doesn't this open up a number of potential even weirder situations. For instance, if Gleowine has become attached to a Nameless Thing, what rule stops me from exhausting Gleowine to draw a card? He is in play, and I still control him…\n\nCaleb's answers to these:\n\nA & B - I think we understand each other now.\nThe difference between Forest Snare and Gleowine is that the Forest Snare is an Attachment. When attached to a legal target, it applies its text. Because Gleowine is an Ally, you can only use his ability when he is in play, in front of you. Obviously, if a Feint is attached to Nameless Thing, you can't pay 1 and discard it to prevent the Nameless Thing from attacking you. Nor can you exhaust Gleowine to draw a card. But the Forest Snare is different: because there is no way of distinguishing a Forest Snare that you played on a Nameless Thing versus one that was top-decked by it's Forced effect it has to work this way.\n\nApologies for posting this at length but I know many people prefer to see the full answers rather than a summary."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67267-fos-rules-questions-official-answers/?do=findComment&comment=656662","commentId":656662,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1341969535,"content":"So to summarise all this:\n\n1.
