I was under the impression based on the articles online here from FFG, that each participant would receive the mat, promo card, and deck pack. At my event,  it was one set per table. Assuming each item goes to one person, that means in a game of four there's one person that gets nothing.\n\nIs that normally how things go? Did my store run it wrong? Granted I did an early sign up to secure a seat and didn't ask so maybe this is normal and I misunderstood. My store definitely did not have enough stock to give more than one set to each table. If this is normal it kinda makes it not worth it to go really.\n\nThe event was fun, but it was a little expensive if you have a 25% chance of walking away with nothing when you can just wait for the product to come out and pay roughly the same price to own it.\n\nThe sentence above the image of the playmat is what I'm referencing: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/8/24/the-woodland-realm/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/8/24/the-woodland-realm/]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit:\n\nJust for anyone who reads this in the future, this was resolved. My store got in touch with FFG to clarify a few things, and wound up ordering more kits to cover the players as one kit per player, rather than the initial one kit per table they had ordered.\n\nMy store contacted me and then I was able to pick up the entire kit with no issue.\n\n \n\nEdited October 29, 2018 by TheGuardian118\nUpdate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284509-fellowship-event-question/?do=findComment&comment=3502736","commentId":3502736,"userName":"soullos","timestamp":1539484874,"content":"From what I understand each kit comes with 4 copies of everything, not 3.

The deck is made up of 14 mini encounter sets, that you then pick seven to build your encounter deck. If you're going against another team, you pick seven for them and they pick seven from you, but from what I could tell they'd need a kit also as there's only a single 1A quest card, and one copy of a unique location that starts in play. The store had one kit per table, not per player.\n\n \n\n> 6 minutes ago, GrandSpleen said:\n> \n> I'll also say that giving one player the mat, one player the scenario, and one player the alt art card, and one player nothing--- that's a really, really weird way to do this.

If we played competitive then we could do 2v2 or something and split prizes that way. As my table was all strangers, even a 2v2 team would have left things hard to split. We decided at my table it would be most fair to role a dice and let high number pick first. Another table was a whole family so they had it easier, though that was an expensive kit for them!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284509-fellowship-event-question/?do=findComment&comment=3502773","commentId":3502773,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1539491469,"content":"Man, that is unfortunate.  So in the past a 'kit' typically supported 4 players, and included 4 mats, 4 copies of the scenario (and the promo art card is packed inside the scenario itself, so that's intended to be one product).  This year a 'kit' seems really only intended for 1 person, but it's advertised as supporting 4 players?  Weird."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284509-fellowship-event-question/?do=findComment&comment=3502782","commentId":3502782,"userName":"Zura","timestamp":1539494615,"content":"This makes me worried about my fellowship event that's happening next month (europe, yay).

They are a great store and I'm really lucky to be near them. This is the first event ever where I left feeling disappointed since I found the place so I'm sure this was just a fluke or misunderstanding between the players and the person who ran it or something I missed that I should have read before signing up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284509-fellowship-event-question/?do=findComment&comment=3503456","commentId":3503456,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1539565761,"content":"That's odd, sorry to hear, @TheGuardian118 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/274633-theguardian118/]!

Our store pretty much refused to get more than one kit even though we could name at least seven people that wanted to buy/participate in a share. He then wanted to charge at least double what he paid for it to let us get shares. The only reason they got divided the way they should was because we were making sure they got divided. All it would take is one guy who was just trying to cheat the system to say \"I get two decks and three mats in one share!\" \n\n \n\nIt's not that LGS operators are stupid, it's that they simply can't keep up with the detail of every single product (or kit) they get. \n\n \n\nI'm not happy at all about the way these kits were released. My store barely knew about them in time to order one. He refused to order more than one due to the usual uncertainty of these things, and they sell out in less than a day.
