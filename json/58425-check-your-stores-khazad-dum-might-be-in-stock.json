It doesn't have that \"cardboard, rigged feeling\" of the base set + Mirkwood AP cards. It's similar to Osgiliath quality, but not as glossy and washed out (the colors are the same, so no worries there). To me, it feels strudier too and I'm glad for that. The previous card quality was too frail for my tastes, forcing me to sleeve.

I'm 100% happy for the change.\n\nI won't go in detail of each of the cards, someone over on BGG has a spoiler thread up, but I do like what I see. The quests are ratings for 3, 5 and 7, so a nice spread there. Nearly every player card is dwarf centric, so being a fan of dwarves I'm ecstatic. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] One thing to note is that one encounter deck is not used at all in any of the new quests, it will be used for future quests in the upcoming AP.

Or the is AP's encounter deck really going to be that big? I wonder...\n\nI'm happy with it overall.
