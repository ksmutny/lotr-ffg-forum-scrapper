These are the ☺ Fellowship sphere cards: Aragorn and Banner of Elendil, as well as the boon cards: Esquire of Rohan and Esquire of Gondor.\" \n\nMy thought process also lead to the idea of sneaking Boons in regular games, but this nugget of text from the Black Riders rulesheet (pg 4) seems like a no: \"Boons are neutral player cards that must be earned by playing through a scenario in campaign mode in order to be used. Players are not allowed to include these cards in a game until after they are earned, unless a scenario directs them to do otherwise.\"\n\nThe rules for boons state they are cannot be included in a game unless they are earned, which implies that they can't be sucked into a game by a contract's setup effect. However that text is omitted from discussion on the Fellowship sphere cards. I know that you can always just play with the cards however you want but it would be fun if this actually worked with the rules as written!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302671-burglars-turn-banner-of-elendil-in-non-saga-games/?do=findComment&comment=3835958","commentId":3835958,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1574605076,"content":"Is the Banner technically a boon?

It is a shame though because some of the biggest/most flavorful \"scores\" exist in the boon cards. Like what kind of amazing burglar would dare to steal Anduril? Or sneak up on Galadriel and pluck a few strands of her hair? Or her phial for that matter? My first thought had been the Treasures as well but then I realized they don't even have the Attachment card type so they were right out 😔\n\n@dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/] I think I'll try it with Burglar's Turn next time a friend and I play through a saga quest just to get a feel for it! Ally Galadriel is another way to cheat a Banner into play; between that and reforged and harvest you could have a pretty consistent orange splash in a standard deck. I've just always been fascinated with getting the exotic/exclusive cards into more games haha"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302671-burglars-turn-banner-of-elendil-in-non-saga-games/?do=findComment&comment=3836839","commentId":3836839,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1574715174,"content":"Not the exact topic of this post, but i was thinking that with a consistent way to fetch ring of barahir (in another deck) and several artifact put in play by this contract,  you can pump hp of an hero to the point of taking undefeated attack almost every turn as long as you bring healing.  This can change the way to model your defense in mid-late game."}]}
