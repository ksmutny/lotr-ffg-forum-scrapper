My house rule is \"If it thematically feels like it should be a ranged attack, it's a ranged attack.\" Which, when translated to actual rules, looks like this:\n\n \n\n1) The Ranged keyword is unchanged from the standard rules; specifically, it does not, by itself, allow you to attack into the staging area.\n\n2) A ranged attack is an attack made by a character with the ranged keyword against an enemy not engaged with him.\n\n \n\nTherefore, if Dúnhere attacks an enemy in the staging area, it's not a ranged attack. But if Legolas uses Bow of the Galadrim, it is a ranged attack. (By the official ruling, it wouldn't be).\n\n \n\nOne result of this is to \"solve\" the thing that always bugged me about Hands Upon the Bow. It requires a character with the Ranged keyword, but doesn't explicitly specify that the attack is a ranged attack. Therefore, when Bard the Bowman puts his Hands Upon the Bow to take a shot into the staging area, he... somehow doesn't trigger his normal \"enemy has -2 defense\" ability, that only triggers on ranged attacks? That feels \"wrong\" to me, so I house-ruled the problem away. This makes the Bard + HUtB combo quite a bit more powerful, but I don't think it unbalances anything -- and it greatly improves my enjoyment of the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238535-attacks-against-enemies-in-the-staging-area-are-considered-ranged-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=2655506","commentId":2655506,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1487934354,"content":"Asked Caleb about Haldir's action - if it considered as a ranged attack when attacking an enemy engaged with another player:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Hi Jan,\n> \n> When Haldir uses his effect, it is not considered a ranged attack.

I would have thought that the attacks against other players would be Ranged attacks, but if Caleb's ruling is that you specifically have to be using the Ranged keyword rather than some other ability for it to count as a Ranged attack, then even Haldir's special-ability attacks against enemies engaged with other players won't be Ranged.\n\nIn this one case, I think Caleb may be wrong. I mean, as the game designer, he's obviously right in this ruling, because the rules are whatever he makes them. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] But I think it's the wrong rule from a thematic standpoint, and that a rule of \"It's a Ranged attack when it would make sense for it to be a Ranged attack, i.e. when a Ranged character has the opportunity to attack an enemy not engaged with him\" provides a more thematic experience and thus more enjoyment. I believe that Hands Upon the Bow should be a Ranged attack, and so should Haldir's ability.\n\nBut enough about my pet peeve / favorite house rule. I'm glad we have a ruling that clarifies all kinds of \"Is this a Ranged attack?\" situations; even if it's not the one I would prefer, it's a ruling that will clear up several other card interactions besides Haldir."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238535-attacks-against-enemies-in-the-staging-area-are-considered-ranged-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=2656798","commentId":2656798,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1488010050,"content":"That ruling contradicts the very explicit definition of ranged attacks in the FAQ, which is odd."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238535-attacks-against-enemies-in-the-staging-area-are-considered-ranged-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=2656897","commentId":2656897,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1488028559,"content":"> 6 hours ago, NathanH said:\n> \n> That ruling contradicts the very explicit definition of ranged attacks in the FAQ, which is odd.\n\nYeah, it does.  It's possible the FAQ entry was meant to say the following (and they instead haphazardly used \"with\":\n\n> Quote\n> \n>  \n> \n> Q: What counts as a “ranged” attack?\n> \n> A: A ranged attack is an attack made by a character with via using the ranged keyword against an enemy engaged with another player.\n> \n>  \n\nAlternatively, the new ruling could be wrong :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nEdit: In hindsight, I realized that using \"with\" in the FAQ sentence can actually mean using, so the FAQ entry can still make sense.  The problem with the FAQ entry is it COULD mean something entirely different.\n\nWith:\n\n1) characterized by having (how we interpreted the FAQ entry originally)\n\n2) using or showing (how it is meant to be interpreted)\n\nSo if you aren't using the Ranged keyword as a part of the attack, it's not a Ranged attack. \n\nAnd our interpretation that simply having the ranged keyword was enough to constitute a Ranged attack (and attacking an enemy engaged with another player) was wrong.\n\nEdited February 25, 2017 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238535-attacks-against-enemies-in-the-staging-area-are-considered-ranged-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=2656927","commentId":2656927,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1488031178,"content":"> Quote\n> \n> Bow of the Galadhrim\n> The Nîn-in-Eilph\n> Item.   Weapon.   \n> Restricted.  \n> Attach to a Silvan character with the ranged keyword.

Parsing the language of the most common words like \"with\" gets old.\n\nBut here, no, since that makes no sense that can't be the meaning in *this* instance. So here it has to mean the \"a character who possesses the Ranged keyword\" meaning.\n\nBut man, I wish FFG would start writing their card game rules in the same kind of \"legalese\" that MtG went with, where there's a standard phrase, made unambiguous by the rules clearly defining the phrase, for every specific effect.
