You could even chump blcck with one and get the others pumped up. They have 3 hitpoints, too, what makes them great at soaking damage and defending.\n\n \n\nNot sure on Linhir Sea-Captain. How many Spirit heroes are there that really Profit from not exhausting? How often do you want to wait for the effect and Count on it showing up? And what should linhir sea captain do with his Action as he is strait out bad at everything except questing? Low expectations for this one :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\n \n\nWinfola surely isn't very useful in a great amount of decks, but we have quite a few Cards that work with removing characters from the quest and Winfola enables some wanky Combos :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] It's ok as a one of for questing only heroes and awesome if someone runs Elfhelm (2WP for 1 as an attachment is really good)\n\n \n\nThe Houses of Healing - Important Name, big effect. We recently got many healers and it should be easy to achieve a cost of 2 or 3 what is low for the effect as all alternatives cost 5. Most likely it will end as Sideboard Card if you expect someone to bring caldara (or Boromir :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])\n\n \n\nNa'asiyah. First of all I think she is super thematic. Having a corsair hero seems odd, but don't letting her pay for allies Shows that she doesn't really have Support from the free People and only helps us, because she got betrayed and we aren't the Monsters she was told we would be. Gameplay wise the Limitation doesn't seem that bad as you will often Play at least 1 attachment or Event per round where you could use her ressource. Getting 2 Points of stats for 1 ressource is a good deal and not having a Limit can really make her insane, without taking potential attachments into account. She is made for combat and combat only. I think the often laught at sword of numenor might be really good in the right quest on her. Stack two and with some readying effects she sweeps the board (merry with fast hitch could to the trick or example). Also jsut bringing her with ressource boosting (someone said rune master and dunedain mark?) to slaughter huge threats. I am excited to test how reliably you can boost her without Feeling to tunnel completly on her (easier in multiplayer for sure!)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231084-storm-on-cobas-haven-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2433180","commentId":2433180,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1475004550,"content":"This pack makes me wanna rebuild my Treebeard deck. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231084-storm-on-cobas-haven-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2433230","commentId":2433230,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1475006857,"content":"> This pack makes me wanna rebuild my Treebeard deck.\n\nRune-master makes me want to actually get caught up on the Grey Havens to augment my Dunedain deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231084-storm-on-cobas-haven-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2433422","commentId":2433422,"userName":"donkler","timestamp":1475014521,"content":"Na'asiyah is going to be great. She is going to be an amazing defender since you get to choose how much you want to pay for her defense boost after the shadow card is already revealed.
