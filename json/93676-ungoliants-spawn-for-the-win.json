We knew it was in the discard pile. Do we reshuffle, or, do we keep playing and wait until we reshuffle the discard pile and find it that way? Also, what if the Spawn comes up as a shadow effect and is discarded? Sounds like we are missing something. Thanks \nTim. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93676-ungoliants-spawn-for-the-win/?do=findComment&comment=911114","commentId":911114,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1384751807,"content":"The quest tells you to search (in encounter deck and discard pile) for one spider per player to add to the staging area.

And the discard deck. Lol, well at least we would have beaten it, we were loaded for bear. Can't believe I didn't get that, oh well, we had fun until we ran into that. Thanks a lot for the help.  "}]}
