It is the same with theodred? Or as its spelling says \"choose a hero\", it cannot target Beorn ?\n\n \n\nWhat about Gaining Strength ?\n\n \n\nI would say that I can use Gaining Strength on Beorn, but I can't target it with Theodred, but I'm not sure at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127898-beorn-and-theodred/?do=findComment&comment=1347531","commentId":1347531,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1417015775,"content":"Bifur doesn´t target Beorn.

Beorn targets Bifur.\n\n \n\nBeorn's not targeting Bifur either. The \"to\" in Bifur's ability means that the first and second half of the ability are separate effects but the second effect is dependent on the first effect's completion. The first effect simply targets the resource. I would say that the second effect targets Bifur's resource pool.\n\n \n\nGaining Strength, Errand-Rider, and Bifur all say we're adding to / discarding from a \"hero's resource pool\", so I assume that the resource pools are the targets and therefore they should all work."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127898-beorn-and-theodred/?do=findComment&comment=1348421","commentId":1348421,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1417074354,"content":"The \"first effect\" doesn´t target anything: it is a cost which can be paid by anyone (unless you would argue that Beorn´s immune effect makes it so that he cannot gain that ability).\n\nAnd if the target in the \"second effect\" had been Beorn´s resource pool then it  couldn´t trigger because of the immune effect, so for simplicity´s sake \"Beorn targets Bifur\" is still quite accurate enough."}]}
