Determine combat damage. This is done by subtracting the defense strength of the defending mcharacter from the attack strength of the attacking enemy. The remaining value is the amount of damage that must immediately be dealt to the defending character, possibly destroying that character....\n\n \n\nSecond: Here is the text of Harbor Master:\n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> Response: After a card effect adds any number of resources to the resource pool of a hero you control, Harbor Master gains +1 [Defense] until the end of the round.\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n\n \n\nThe reaction (=card effect) is triggered once and you get one resource for each damage dealt to Gloin as a result. We conclude: The card effect (=reaction) is only triggered once, hence you only get the bonus once.\n\n \n\nWhy the wording? Because it's shorter and better to understand.
