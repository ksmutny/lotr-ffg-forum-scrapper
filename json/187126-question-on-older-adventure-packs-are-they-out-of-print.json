I have beatten The path thru Mirkwood twice, and a Journey down the Audin once. Currently beating my head against the wall that is Dol Goldur, but so far I'm enjoying getting my butt kicked. But I am also starting to look towards future expansions and have noticed that several of the older ones, like the Hunt for Gollum appear to be out of stock both on the Fantasy Flight Games store and other on online retailers. Are these out of print, or do the adventure packs come back in to stock periodically?\n\nThank you for your time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187126-question-on-older-adventure-packs-are-they-out-of-print/?do=findComment&comment=1776080","commentId":1776080,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1441412711,"content":"They come back in stock periodically.

Fun but brutal. I am very impressed with the folks that are able to beat this with just the core set. We are gonna tweak the decks abit and try agian.\n\nLooking forward to expanding my card pool a little, (and really like the idea of tracking Gollum down)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187126-question-on-older-adventure-packs-are-they-out-of-print/?do=findComment&comment=1787789","commentId":1787789,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1441969965,"content":"Dol-Guldur is mostly a question of timing:\n\n \n\n- you need to quest quick enough through stage 1 to regain control of the prisoner, otherwise it could be problematic (clearly this factor becomes less impacting with the increasing number of players); so if you go core, be sure to have Eowyn in the mix for a potential +6 willpower; and probably Legolas to gain bonus progress markers (arm him with 2 Blades of Gondolin and it's a +4 / round; if you give him Unexpected Courage, it's a +8 / round)\n\n \n\n- you must have in the deck something allowing you to avoid location locks, so, Northern Tracker (who autokills the darn Tower Gate location)\n\n \n\n- you need to have a way to control the Nazgul, so that you can engage him and kill him during stage 2 (stage 2 is delicate, but it's easier than Stage 1 because you control all your heroes: don't quest too strong - rushing to Stage 3 could be detrimental if the Nazgul is alive - but don't loose to much time). Thalin while questing, + Sneak Attacking Gandalf during Resource and playing him immediately afterwards means the Nazgul is dead. End of the story, in 6 resources only\n\n \n\n- as soon as you enter Stage 3 with the Nazgul dead, play all the allies you can and powerquest to victory in just one round\n\n \n\nBe patient; it looks nightmarish, but you can do it.

Still, even without Thalin, the idea is to get rid of the Nazgul as soon as possible. Don't keep in the staging area due to the +5 threat, don't keep it engaged with you or it could be messy..."}]}
