If play solo I use the second threat tracker - very comfortable, they lay together and I don't forget to raise both of them, but I play solo very rarely. Most I play 2 player's game and I always forget to and one new round to count."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56039-new-scoring-system-counter/?do=findComment&comment=553835","commentId":553835,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1320813084,"content":"Actually i thing is really uncomfortable to keep you scores with any additional tool. Cose we already have a lot of tokens and threat tracker. So one more tool can be to much. This make game more hard in annoy way. No one really need it.\n\nBut the same time they definitely need to change score system cose is doesn work properly. And the same time they changes  limited by  already created tournament system.  So i think we need to wait until we see how tournament system work. Than we can say what is it really."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56039-new-scoring-system-counter/?do=findComment&comment=553920","commentId":553920,"userName":"OnkelZorni","timestamp":1320830004,"content":"I use damage tokens to keep track of played rounds, works quite well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56039-new-scoring-system-counter/?do=findComment&comment=554317","commentId":554317,"userName":"willmanx","timestamp":1320889021,"content":"Take a Post-It : count threat level of each player on it and the number of round.

And at the end of game it was simple to subtract number of result threat level and start threat level, and it was number of rounds. But when I played Journey down the Anduin, at the end of game it was hard to remember how many times and who was hit by Troll, Marsh Added etc."}]}
