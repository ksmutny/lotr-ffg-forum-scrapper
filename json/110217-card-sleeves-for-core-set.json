They have:\n\n \n\nAlmost a penny sleeves (Lower quality) \n\n \n\nCard Game Sleeves (Average Quality) \n\n \n\nPremium Card Sleeves (Higher Quality)\n\nThey are all fit LOTR LCG but they are just different quality, feel and how perfect the fit.   \n\n \n\nSame thing goes with Ultra Pro's. \n\n \n\nYou have to decide if you want higher quality and pay more or the opposite. \n\n \n\nYes I know, buying sleeves is very confusing......I'd recommend buying a few different kinds and seeing which ones you like best, then get a bunch more and sleeve your game. \n\n \n\nHope this is helpful,\n\nKhamul\n\nEdited July 6, 2014 by Khamul The Easterling"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110217-card-sleeves-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=1145445","commentId":1145445,"userName":"lucmobz","timestamp":1404675249,"content":"Many thanks for the thourough response!

Card sleeves that fit such as Magic the Gathering cards will fit them.\n\n \n\nFirst, get normal sized sleeves, not the smaller \"perfect fit\" or \"pro fit\" ones. Those are meant to be the inner sleeve when double sleeving your cards, and are so precisely sized that some of your cards (depending on the print run they came from) might be a millimeter too wide and thus won't fit. (This happened to me.)\n\n \n\nKMC Hyper Mat (made in Japan) and Dragon Shield (made in Denmark) are the best card sleeves you can get. Ultra Pro (made in China) is cheap and not particularly worth it. I don't recommend FFG's card sleeves because they are somewhat longer than the length of the cards, and thus have too much excess sleeve on the open end.\n\n \n\nThey seem expensive when you think $10 for a box of 100 Dragoin Shields or $8 for a package of 80 KMCs, especially when you have 226 cards in the core set alone, but that price is pretty much the average price for anything but penny sleeves and Ultra Pro. Trust me, I've tried Ultra Pro. Dragon Shield and KMC are far better as far as protection and have a better shuffle feel to them as well.\n\nEdited July 23, 2014 by chyron8472"}]}
