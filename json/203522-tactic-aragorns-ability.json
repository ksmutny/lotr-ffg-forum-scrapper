We had two situations where we got stuck and discussed about Aragorn' Ability to engage an enemy after he destroyed one.\n\n \n\n1) An enemy with Ambush attached is optionally engaged by Aragorn before the combat phase. The enemy get a shadow card in the combat phase and after that Ambush is discarded and Aragorn managed to kill the enemy. After that he engages a new enemy from the staging area.\n\nQuestion: Does this enemy attack Aragorn's player?\n\n \n\n2) Same situation, but Aragorn has Rivendell Bow attached and while staging \"Sudden Assault\" is revealed, which results in an immediate attack of three enemy against the first player. Can Aragorn sniper one enemy with \"Hand upon the bow\" and engage one of the enemies so only one enemy is left in the staging area .. which results in only one immediate attack?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203522-tactic-aragorns-ability/?do=findComment&comment=2068712","commentId":2068712,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1456299245,"content":"1) Since you are using the Ambush trap to make the attack (presumably before the enemy has had a chance to attack you) then the newly engaged enemy will make an attack, since the enemy attack part of the combat phase is not over. If however you had attacked as part of the normal framework, then the new enemy would not be able to attack you.\n\n \n\n2) I would say that all the enemies have already been activated by the card text to make an attack; That one or more moves to a new place does not prevent said attack from taking place. The enemy destroyed by Hands Upon the Bow is no longer in play though and thus is not capable of finishing/performing the attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203522-tactic-aragorns-ability/?do=findComment&comment=2069020","commentId":2069020,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1456323165,"content":"Agree with Nerdmeister, I'd say those enemies in the staging area have had their attacks queued up, and engaging one at this point will not stop its attack).  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203522-tactic-aragorns-ability/?do=findComment&comment=2069073","commentId":2069073,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1456324777,"content":"Mmm.. i'm not with you .. \n\nIn the combat phase all enemies engaged with me are queued up for attacking me.

They will NOT under normal circumstances however receive a shadow card (unless it's Carn Dum or some special circumstance). Shadow cards are delt to all engaged enemies at thw beginning of the combat phase. He was not engaged at the beginning of the combat phase. Understand that enemies do get shadow cards if they make additional or immediate attacks in or outside the combat phase but this is not an additional or immediate attack. This would be considered its first normal attack during the framework of the game and it simply missed its opportunity to get a shadow card by not being engaged at the beginning of the combat phase. This is similar to how the Balrog in Shadow and Flame might attack a player if that player raised its threat above 0 in the combat action window after shadow cards were dealt. It's considered the first normal attack in the game framework and will not get a shadow card and is one of the few times an enemy won't get a shadow card."}]}
