For example, Tales from the Cards recently posted about a way to play multiple scenarios in a row on a sort of campaign mode, and my own playgroup has developed our own method of doing something similar (e.g., playing an entire cycle of scenarios in a row with the same decks, etc.). \n\n \n\nWouldn't it be cool to see something like a $99.00 or even $125.00 expansion that played almost like a campaign of D&D? For example, the box would include many scenarios (maybe 20-30), and decisions would be made after each one, at which time you advance to another scenario, but there is a loose order to them, and treasures and bonuses to be gained at each. There would also be some scenarios that would absolutely destroy the players unless they had already passed through some of the others, forcing the players to \"adventure\" and gain in strength, gathering important items, etc., before moving on to the final few scenarios of the campaign. They could also introduce something like \"leveling up\", perhaps a special card that a hero can earn that is placed under the card and grants +1 to all stats or something like that. That way there doesn't need to be broken or OP cards printed for the epic expansion....as people progress through it, they collect these \"level up\" cards that buff the heroes and are only for use in that campaign setting. \n\n \n\nThoughts about something like that?\n\nEdited August 15, 2014 by divinityofnumber"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113429-epic-deluxe-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=1202223","commentId":1202223,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1408121981,"content":"good idea, id certainly buy it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] though i guess the amount of time and resources it would take up, it would need to perhaps stand in for other content and not alongside it , but thats ok to me"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113429-epic-deluxe-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=1203277","commentId":1203277,"userName":"Djenni","timestamp":1408134463,"content":"I would seriously love something like that. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113429-epic-deluxe-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=1222029","commentId":1222029,"userName":"Snowhive","timestamp":1408875043,"content":"That would be great!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113429-epic-deluxe-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=1222256","commentId":1222256,"userName":"7theye","timestamp":1408887310,"content":"You are being impractical.\n\nThis is not about creating epic games or expansions.

It would require the players to roam around, collecting certain items needed to move beyond later scenarios. \n\n \n\nJust brainstorming. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113429-epic-deluxe-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=1223035","commentId":1223035,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1408920678,"content":">  \n> \n> > You are being impractical.\n> > \n> > This is not about creating epic games or expansions.

I get that the game's original intent was to be scenario driven and all, but it's just that the world and the lore is so rich and grand that IMO this system doesn't do it a lot of justice. And don't get me wrong, I like how the game is going now, but if we had a paralel sandbox format in which we could choose our own goals from an expanded pool of objectives and locations in a map, it would be awesome."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113429-epic-deluxe-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=1223199","commentId":1223199,"userName":"Jackelantern","timestamp":1408930526,"content":"I feel as though this game is in good hands after watching the GenCon video.

I think this may even extend to Angmar Awakened as well. We've also got Old Forest AND Barrow Downs coming out as quests that are part of the saga and include boons (old forest does at least) so when these and road darkens are released we'll have 8 saga quests you can play in order as a campaign, 11 when treason of saruman come out!\n\nThere are also going to be side quests in The Lost Realm now.\n\nHonestly I think what you guys are discussing is really not needed for this game, it's already getting more diverse and role playing/campaign esque as time passes on its own and what you guys are proposing seems like an entirely different game that would be better if it was made seperately as its own.\n\nDon't get me wrong I love the idea but really like this game and don't want to see it become something completely different."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113429-epic-deluxe-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=1223269","commentId":1223269,"userName":"KennedyHawk2","timestamp":1408933378,"content":"I'd love this.\n\n \n\nA sort of choose your own adventure epic saga.\n\n \n\nYou make a choice at the end of scenario 2 (or during phase 2 of scenario 2), it sends you to quest 3-4-5 or 6-7-8 depending on the choice your team makes.
