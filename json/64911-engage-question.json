Or does it \"engage\" each round giving it +1 attack each round?\n\n \n\nThanks\n\n \n\n                         "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64911-engage-question/?do=findComment&comment=634192","commentId":634192,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1337640369,"content":"The Spider only gets +1 attack on the round in which it engages a player. Once an enemy engages, it remains engaged unless it dies or is otherwise disengaged via a card effect; it does not \"re-engage\" every round (see p. 20 of the rules).\n\nSo, unless the Forest Spider gets returned to the staging area (via cards like A Light in the Dark) or engages another player (via Son of Arnor), its attack bonus will usually only last for a single round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64911-engage-question/?do=findComment&comment=634675","commentId":634675,"userName":"91Vaapad013","timestamp":1337708547,"content":"Thanks, That's the perfect answer to my question.
