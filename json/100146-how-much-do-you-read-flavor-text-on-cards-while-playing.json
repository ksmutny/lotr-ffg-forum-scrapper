Just looking through my cards or setting up for a scenario I've played many times however I will read the flavor text as it is often really thematic and interesting just as you said distracting when your trying to actively beat a quest (especially considering I play two handed and have to stay focused while playing or can sometimes make small mistakes)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100146-how-much-do-you-read-flavor-text-on-cards-while-playing/?do=findComment&comment=997430","commentId":997430,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1393483892,"content":"In my group we read the quest flavor out loud as we progress through it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100146-how-much-do-you-read-flavor-text-on-cards-while-playing/?do=findComment&comment=997489","commentId":997489,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1393490845,"content":"That's sad that so many don't read the flavor text!
