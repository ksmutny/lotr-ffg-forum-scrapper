Since the search function of the forums does not seem to work for me, I checked the current FAQ, which only led to more confusion.\n\nPg. 14: Step 3: Quest Resolution (paragraph 2) states \"Note that if there is an active location (see page 15), progress tokens are placed on that location until it is explored, and the remainder are then placed on the current quest.\"\n\nPg. 15 Shows a progress token being placed on the Quest Deck, not Gladden Fields. This seems incorrect as stated above.\n\nThe FAQ (1.00 The Golden Rule) seems to agree with my assessment, am I incorrect?\n\n \n\nthanks,\n\nCharbs"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59837-resolving-a-quest/?do=findComment&comment=587883","commentId":587883,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1328029254,"content":"its says gladden fields is in the staging area, likely they have not travelled to it so it is not the active location\n\nyou are correct though- if it was the active location they would have gone on it"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59837-resolving-a-quest/?do=findComment&comment=587967","commentId":587967,"userName":"Charbs2","timestamp":1328038054,"content":" Thanks,\n\nI just learned Death Angel last night - these rulebooks are making me cross-eyed!"}]}
