This has some cool side-benefits of being able to then do the 'compare quests with a friend' under 'Quest View' to see and compare Sphere Weights and Hero Percentages within your group.\n\nWhat we do, is I use the score sheet printouts while our group is playing, keeping track of scores and everyone's heroes, and then once they leave I enter my results in the quest log and email the information to my friends for them to do the same.\n\nIt's worked pretty good for us so far."}]}
