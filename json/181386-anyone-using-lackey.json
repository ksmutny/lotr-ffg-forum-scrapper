However, I'm sure there must be some Lackey players out there, but you'll probably have to use forums like this to arrange games in advance.\n\n \n\nFFG does not officially endorse these online platforms, but they don't squash them either. It appears that FFG tolerates their existence, but will probably never say so outright. What seems to help is that OCTGN and Lackey follow a policy of not releasing card images until 6 months after a release."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181386-anyone-using-lackey/?do=findComment&comment=1676944","commentId":1676944,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1435684031,"content":"The big advantage of Lackey is that it is built for the entire community, working on Mac, Linux and Windows."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181386-anyone-using-lackey/?do=findComment&comment=1690921","commentId":1690921,"userName":"Salex215","timestamp":1436801764,"content":"Anyone use the Lackey from apple ios ?
