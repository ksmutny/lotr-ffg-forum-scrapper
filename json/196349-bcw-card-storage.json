As in Mirkwood and Khazad Dum cycles? As my collection grows I was going to use the original box for player cards, tokens, etc. and then break out expansions by twos.\n\n \n\nThanks!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196349-bcw-card-storage/?do=findComment&comment=1946700","commentId":1946700,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1450644019,"content":"If you know that you'll grow your LOTR LCG game, than the most storage space you can get for your cards, the better."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196349-bcw-card-storage/?do=findComment&comment=1946735","commentId":1946735,"userName":"mewmartigan","timestamp":1450646222,"content":"Yeah, I looked at the mega sized boxes but they would be crazy heavy and I didn't want to carry EVERYTHING all the time.\n\n \n\nI will probably just try the 800 count box and fill the back end with foam if there is too much space left."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196349-bcw-card-storage/?do=findComment&comment=1947025","commentId":1947025,"userName":"soullos","timestamp":1450658971,"content":"800 count might work. For some perspective. I have one entire cycle (Deluxe + 6 APs) and one Gencon quest sleeved in FFG sleeves fitting into a 550 count box with some room to spare (enough for another AP, but that's it). I use an 660 count box for the first 3 LotR Saga boxes plus 2 POD quests (Old Forest and Barrowdowns) with a little less room to spare. 800 count might work for 2 full cycles. If you're including Nightmare as well, maybe not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196349-bcw-card-storage/?do=findComment&comment=1948224","commentId":1948224,"userName":"mewmartigan","timestamp":1450718946,"content":"Thanks for the info. I will give the 800 count a shot.\n\n \n\nNightmare is a long ways off for me, haha."}]}
