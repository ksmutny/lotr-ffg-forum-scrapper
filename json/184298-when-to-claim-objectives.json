Or does it need an action window and another round?\n\nÂ \n\nThanks,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184298-when-to-claim-objectives/?do=findComment&comment=1722541","commentId":1722541,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1438832400,"content":"As the action on the objectives does not state any restrictions, you can trigger it in any action window. So yes, you can wait to claim any of the objectives until you already have enough progress on stage 1 to immediately advance once you have the objective. You can also wait to claim the other two objectives until the Planning phase after placing enough progress on stage 2, thus avoiding the end of the round effects from the objectives while still progressing through the quest at the same rate."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184298-when-to-claim-objectives/?do=findComment&comment=1722981","commentId":1722981,"userName":"Dsbessie","timestamp":1438861719,"content":"Thanks for the reply."}]}
