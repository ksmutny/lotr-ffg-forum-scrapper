Just look at the state of the game now. There is an enemy engaged with you? Now Halbarad doesnt have to exhaust for committing while other characters probably have to exhaust.You also have to apply any forced effects and may apply reaction effects already in game now. When all is set and done you start staging and reveal encounter cards one by one.\n\nJust treat Committing to a quest as a single step you have to finish completely before you go to the next step Staging."}]}
