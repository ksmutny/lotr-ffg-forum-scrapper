I like to use it with Gandalf, even though his ability wont work because \"sneak attack\" does not qualify as a trigger for his effect, his willpower or attack are still useful for that phase. Remember the ally will only stay in play until the END of the PHASE, then returns to your hand. If it is the combat phase then the ally will stay in play until ALL attacks have been resolved.\n\n \n\nI use a leadership/lore deck and have had sneak attack in my deck since I created it.\n\nRed=Edits\n\nEdited January 25, 2014 by tacomen253"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97776-new-player-first-game-some-thoughts-and-questions/?do=findComment&comment=964526","commentId":964526,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1390688501,"content":"> I like to use it with Gandalf, even though his ability wont work because \"sneak attack\" does not qualify as a trigger for his effect, his willpower or attack are still useful for that phase.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe \"into play\" effects on card that are put into play temporarily from sneak attack  DO trigger.

That enemy is not attacking someone else and is not in the staging area...\n\nNo, it has little use in solo player, though some mobs sit in the staging area and their text says they can not be enganged, so it dose work then. It is mainly for pulling agro away fomr your questing partner in multiplayer.\n\nAll it dose is instantly engage a monster that is in the stagin area. It dose NOT start a imediate combat, you still only do the normal combat round as you always do. Also, almost all player effcts are \"MAY\" effects, so you can choose not to active the ability if you want... and you can cast him even if there is no target for the ability.. the trigger fizzles but the card still comes into play as a norma lally.\n\nIt is worth noting that Sneak Attack and other \"into play\" effects that may allow you to play this card at action speed can pull the mob out of the staging area BEFORE quest progress tokens are placed, as there is a action window after all the staging area cards are revealed.\n\n \n\n\n\n> Forest spider only gets the +1 attack during the round he engages right? If he is still alive in the next round he doesn't still get the bonus.\n\nAny round it enganges. If for any reason it moves to a new player, or bounces to the staging area and enganges again, the trigger will again go off. Still in 99% of the cases you are right.. it only gets the plus on on the same round that it engages a player.\n\n \n\n\n\n> For sneak attack, the ally I deploy attacks but survives the round.

This includes the hand.\n\n \n\n\n\n> At one point I pulled a treachery card that said I couldn't refresh a hero at the end of the round. Does an exhausted hero still get a resource token during the first phase of the next round? I gave him one.\n\nIf you mean \"caught in the web\" then yes.. you still get resources. It only stops you readying.

Something you cast and then it is gone. There are cards that act like you describe, but they need to be on the table.. like a attachment or a action ability on a ally. To put it simply a event is just card that allows you to play effects with out a permanent in play.\n\nEvents are NOT effects. If you look at any card, including a event, you can see that there is a timing window keyword.. like Action, Response, etc etc. This NOT the fact it is an event card determines when you can cast it. At the back of the manual there is a chart of green and red bars that decide up the turn phases. The green bars are ACTION WINDOWS and you can only play action IN that window. Meanwhile there is also some events with \"response\" these do not need a action window and can be played at any time the trigger occurs. Also recently they have added things like \"Travel Action\" that restricts witch action window the event can be cast (opposed to all actions windows)\n\nA good example is ....\n\nmed_a-test-of-will-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_a-test-of-will-core.jpg]med_dwarven-tomb-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_dwarven-tomb-core.jpg]\n\nBoth these are events, but one is a response and one is a action. Test of Will allows you to cancel a when revealed effect on a card. Note that this is a response... as in the instant the trigger when it occurs (a when reveled card is drawn) the card can be cast.. OUTSIDE the action window. Tomb is a action, and allows you to put a spirit card from the graveyard to your hand...\n\nWhy is this a good example? Well.. if you look at the chart you can see the action window only opens at the END of the staging step, after all the cards are revealed. So if you had a tomb in hand and not a test of will, as tomb is a action, you can not cast it, retrieve a test of will and then cast that to stop a when reveled effect, as there is no action window to cast tomb before the effect resolves.\n\nThis is why Elenor's ability is a response.\n\nmed_eleanor-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_eleanor-core.jpg]\n\nThis other attachment is a action.. another common mistake is using UC to untap Elenor, and then tapping her to cancel a when revealed.. this again doesn't work as UC used the action window.\n\nmed_unexpected-courage-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_unexpected-courage-core.jpg]\n\n \n\n\n\n> On last thing....in the \"chosen path\" of Mirkwood I pulled the path where you must defeat Ungoliath's Spawn. I had already defeated him earlier in the game when he came out. Does the game end there?  I pulled him out as my spider draw according to the quest and was able to beat him again for practice but I don't know if that was necessary....\n\nThe path \"Don't Leave the Path\" says you may search wither the deck or discard for a spider. BUT it also says you HAVE to \"find and defeat\" Ungoliant Spawn to pass this card.. so yes.. you HAVE to have one player choose Ungoliant if it is in the discard, or you will need to cycle the entire deck. If he is in the deck still, you can not get him and just dig him out if you wish.. but in most cases one player should pick him,\n\nThe other path says you can not defeat the stage while it is in play... this means that you do no need to find him and fight him again. BUT if he dose turn up you must kill him before you move on.\n\nEdited January 27, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97776-new-player-first-game-some-thoughts-and-questions/?do=findComment&comment=965768","commentId":965768,"userName":"mewmartigan","timestamp":1390838973,"content":">  \n> \n> med_eleanor-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_eleanor-core.jpg]\n> \n> This other attachment is a action.. another common mistake is using UC to untap Elenor, and then tapping her to cancel a when revealed.. this again doesn't work as UC used the action window.\n> \n> med_unexpected-courage-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_unexpected-courage-core.jpg]\n> \n> \n> \n>  \n\n \n\nThanks for the detailed response.

Or was there any official ruling changing it?\n\nNo you are correct, Cannot is a absolute term, mainly used for things like \"cannot play events\" on travelled locations or \"cannot have attachments\" and stuff....\n\nBut there is also a \"cannot\" about optionally engaging... many cannot's uses very specific rule text.. like Goblin Sniper, Goblin Archer, Goblin Scout and Daughter Of Beruthiel for example. These have \"cannot optionally engage\".. but you can use Son of Anor to draw it form the staging area. While other Cards like Blog or Smaug the Golden also have text that makes engangment compleatly impossible\n\nmed_daughter-of-beruthiel-tsf.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_daughter-of-beruthiel-tsf.jpg]med_goblin-sniper-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_goblin-sniper-core.jpg]\n\nvs\n\nmed_smaug-the-golden-otd.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_smaug-the-golden-otd.jpg]med_bolg-otd.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_bolg-otd.jpg]\n\n \n\n\n\n> In your example above with UC and Eleanor....does that mean that each player can only take one action per action window? Or are you just saying that Eleanor can't be exhausted again because she can only exhaust \"when revealed\" and the treachery card had already \"been revealed\" before the action window you used UC?\n\nYou can take as many action between as many players as you like as long as it is in a action window.\n\nI am saying that \"When Revealed\" effects occur instantly \"when they are revealed\"... in the case of the staging step, the action window is right at the end after ALL the cards are revealed. There is no action step between each card, only at the end after all of them are revealed.\n\nSay you are playing a 1 player game and you have a UC on Elenore. You quest, you draw 1 encounter card and it is a treachery, you tap elenore to cancel it and now replace it with the next card that is also a treachery. You can not tap UC and then tap Elenore again to cancel that second treachery, as US is at action speed.\n\nHere is an example of a response card to things going into the staging area\n\nmed_striders-path-thfg.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_striders-path-thfg.jpg]\n\nEdited January 28, 2014 by booored"}]}
