Sweet!\n\nI have a follow-up question, on which I can’t find a ruling: if Prince Imrahil is one of my 2 allies coming in from my discard pile via Caldara’s ability, does his hero status begin immediately and net me one more ally from the discard pile?\n\nIt seems too good to be true, but I also thought the answer linked above was too good to be true, and it’s officially verified!\n\nAnyone know the answer?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298549-caldara-and-prince-imrahil-from-discards/?do=findComment&comment=3758995","commentId":3758995,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1565275905,"content":"Essentially, no, you cannot do as you state.\n\nExcerpting the ruling you cited:\n\n\n\n> So﻿﻿, you must discard Caldara before you can resolve the rest of her effect. That means Imrahil is ﻿a hero at th﻿e time that you calculate ho﻿w m﻿a﻿ny a﻿llies you put into p﻿l﻿a﻿﻿﻿y…\n\n\n\nTo rephrase this, you pay the cost of Caldara's ability (discarding her) and determine at that time what her effect does. Because in your scenario Imrahil is not in play yet—he is still in your discard pile before you resolve Caldara's effect—he cannot count as a hero for the purposes of Caldara.\n\nTo put it another way, you don't resurrect Imrahil first, then say, \"Hey, I have another hero with a printed Spirit icon, now I count him for Caldara too!\" The # of resurrected allies is determined once and not modified by what happens thereafter."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298549-caldara-and-prince-imrahil-from-discards/?do=findComment&comment=3759015","commentId":3759015,"userName":"WE_RIDE_NORTH","timestamp":1565277055,"content":"Very succinctly explained.  Thanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298549-caldara-and-prince-imrahil-from-discards/?do=findComment&comment=3759180","commentId":3759180,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1565289316,"content":"Just to add up and clarify:\n\nAlthough Prince Imrahil [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Prince-Imrahil-TFotW?Lang=EN] can't count towards Caldara ability, he still looses ally type and becomes a hero...\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298549-caldara-and-prince-imrahil-from-discards/?do=findComment&comment=3759267","commentId":3759267,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1565294236,"content":"> 1 hour ago, CJMatos said:\n> \n> Just to add up and clarify:\n> \n> Although Prince Imrahil [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Prince-Imrahil-TFotW?Lang=EN] can't count towards Caldara ability, he still looses ally type and becomes a hero...\n\nSure, once he's in play, and a hero (presumably Caldara) remains in the discard pile."}]}
