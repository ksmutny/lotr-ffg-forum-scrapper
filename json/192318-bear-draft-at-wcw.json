I would like to host something at the FGG World Championships next week.\n\n \n\nThursday night (11/05) is the ideal night for me. I'm playing in the Star Wars Swiss rounds and should be ready to go with the draft by 7:00pm. Dan said the card draft itself can take 30 to 45 minutes plus the length of the quest.\n\n \n\nAnyone interested in joining in on the fun?\n\nEdited October 28, 2015 by Thanatopsis"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192318-bear-draft-at-wcw/?do=findComment&comment=1869110","commentId":1869110,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1446069691,"content":"I wish that Landroval could just drop me off in Minnesota!
