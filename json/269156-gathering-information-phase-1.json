(Check it out here: http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Project_ANCUR_Wiki [http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Project_ANCUR_Wiki] )\n\nThe LotR LCG community has long deserved a similar resource—we all know that the extant official rulings floating around could fill volumes. I want to try to assemble these into a viewable, searchable format. (Anyone who's suffered through searching the forums here for rulings knows that a better way must exist.)\n\nFirst things first, though: data collection. Obviously, there are several places that already contain many rulings. But harvesting the data will be an arduous process.\n\nSo let me start with lower-hanging fruit: I've set up a bare-bones form where people can log official rulings that they've PERSONALLY received over e-mail via the official rules inquiry form on FFG's website:\n\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/VGuE7WFTXEcehoCq2 [https://goo.gl/forms/VGuE7WFTXEcehoCq2]\n\nI figure seeding a database with these e-mailed rulings would be a good start, as it ensures minimal duplication of results. Also, a relatively small number of people have probably generated a disproportionate percentage of the rulings, so if I can get \"buy-in\" from those few, we should have a pretty good start.\n\nI hope you agree this could be a valuable resource for the community. I will keep you posted with how things are going."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/269156-gathering-information-phase-1/?do=findComment&comment=3204105","commentId":3204105,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1518035557,"content":"In Thrones and L5R, developer rulings get added directly to the ThronesDB/FiveringsDB card page by a volunteer.

The issue is (and I'm not saying this isn't the case in other LCGs, but…), rather a lot of the rulings in LotR are not terribly card-specific, so I'm not sure the card-database model for rulings works for this game. This is part of why ANCUR still exists.\n\n(Separate point: a lot of rulings are encounter-card-based rather than player card, so we'd basically be begging Beorn to add the functionality to the Hall.)"}]}
