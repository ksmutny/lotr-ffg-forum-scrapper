Any damage that is dealt by card effects does not take in acount the character defense.\n\n \n\n2 - Yes. Only in the other card you have to search and kill Ungoliant's Spawn. In Beorn's Path, if the Ungoliant's Spawn appears then to be able to win you must kill it.\n\nOn note: in the other 3B card, even if you have already killed Ungoliant's Spawn previously, you need to kill it again. In sum, you need to kill it on that particular card….\n\n \n\n3 - The enemy retains the damage. You only remove damage from an enemy by any card effect. There are none in the Core set…\n\n \n\n4 - Yes. Both attacks can be legally declared and are able to take place. What you can not do is having Dunhere with Unexpected Courage attack the same enemy twice…\n\n \n\n5 - There are no restrictions on the number of cards that you can attach to a single character, with two exceptions:\n\na) the card itself tells you that:\n\n- Keeping Count (TRG): Attach to a hero. Limit 1 per hero;\n\n- Love of Tales (TLD): Attach to a [Lore] hero. Limit 1 per hero;\n\nb) Restricted: a character can only have two restricted attachments.\n\n \n\nThere are some playing restrictions that are mentioned on the attachmente card, like on the two examples above, Keeping Count can only be played on a hero and Love of Tales is even more restrictive by only allow to be polayed on a Lore hero….\n\n \n\nHope to have answered to all the questions. Any doubt, feel free to post"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82446-beginners-questions/?do=findComment&comment=785722","commentId":785722,"userName":"Jedi66","timestamp":1366132949,"content":"Hi Carlos, thank you so very much for taking the time to reply.

They do from locations to quest cards, however. If you quest very successfully and can place 4 progress tokens in total but the current location only needs 2, you remove it and place the other 2 on the quest card (but you probably know this)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82446-beginners-questions/?do=findComment&comment=939251","commentId":939251,"userName":"BadLuckGuardsman","timestamp":1388162175,"content":"Hi, I just started playing the game and I have a quick question:\n\nWhen committing an ally to the quest in the core set (I think it was a Guide) it says I can place a progress token on an active location.
