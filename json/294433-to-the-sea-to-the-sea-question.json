I don’t see anything that says you have to actually play a Noldor ally after discarding, just that the cost of the next one played is decreased by one for each card you discard.\n\nMy other question is that it doesn’t say the cost of the next Noldor ally YOU play is decreased, just “the next Noldor ally played this phase”. So can you use it to decrease the cost of an ally played from another deck?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294433-to-the-sea-to-the-sea-question/?do=findComment&comment=3687302","commentId":3687302,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1556104937,"content":"> 47 minutes ago, Schrodinger's Hat said:\n> \n> My other question is that it doesn’t say the cost of the next Noldor ally YOU play is decreased, just “the next Noldor ally played this phase”.
