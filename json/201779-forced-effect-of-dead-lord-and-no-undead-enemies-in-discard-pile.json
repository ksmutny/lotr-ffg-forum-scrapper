Or can I only engage him optionally if I can fulfill all conditions (i.e. if there is an undead enemy in the discard pile)?\n\n \n\nThanks in advance for clarifying!\n\n \n\nA"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201779-forced-effect-of-dead-lord-and-no-undead-enemies-in-discard-pile/?do=findComment&comment=2038601","commentId":2038601,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1454885214,"content":"You can still engage him if there's no undead enemy the discard.\n\n \n\nHis ability says: \"Forced: After Dead Lord engages you, put the topmost Undead enemy in the discard pile into play engaged with you.\"\n\n \n\nIf it there was text like on this card \"Do X to do Y,\" then you would need to do X before you were allowed to do Y (because X is worded as the \"cost\" of the effect).\n\n \n\nAn example of that would be the travel effect on this card:\n\n \n\nIthilien-Woods.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Land-of-Shadow/Ithilien-Woods.jpg]\n\n \n\nI don't think enemies are generally worded this way, because they tend to have \"Forced\" effects (which work like Responses, and trigger after something happens, such as a player engaging the enemy).   Locations on the other hand can have Forced effects or Travel effects, and Travel is like an action, which has a cost that you need to pay before you can travel to that location.\n\n \n\nSome enemies may have passive text that makes you do something in order to engage it, though.  I can't think of many examples, but I found this one:\n\n \n\nDr%C3%BAadan-Stalker.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Druadan-Forest-Nightmare/Dr%C3%BAadan-Stalker.jpg]\n\nEdited February 7, 2016 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201779-forced-effect-of-dead-lord-and-no-undead-enemies-in-discard-pile/?do=findComment&comment=2039725","commentId":2039725,"userName":"Agesilaos","timestamp":1454949023,"content":"Hi, GrandSpleen,\n\n \n\nThanks for the quick reply, explanation and additional examples, much appreciated!\n\n \n\nA"}]}
