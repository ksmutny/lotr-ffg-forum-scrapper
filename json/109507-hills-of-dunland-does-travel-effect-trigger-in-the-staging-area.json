Whilst drawing that card however I assume its still in staging so its other effect will trigger forcing each player to discard the top card of the encounter deck and put it into play engaged with him if it is an enemy. This makes it a very difficult location to deal with! You have to travel there or its effect will trigger every turn... and even traveling there ensures it will trigger at least that one time!

My thinking is that it happens in order: you draw a card, and then you travel. Since you draw the card before you travel the location is still in the staging area and its effect triggers."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109507-hills-of-dunland-does-travel-effect-trigger-in-the-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=1140641","commentId":1140641,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1404280199,"content":"When a location has a Travel cost, the players must pay that cost before they can travel to that location. So, Hills of Dunland is in the staging area when you trigger its Travel effect, which means you will also trigger its Forced effect when you do.\nHope you’re enjoying The Dunland Trap!\nCheers,\nCaleb\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nJust to eliminate all speculation on the matter :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109507-hills-of-dunland-does-travel-effect-trigger-in-the-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=1140729","commentId":1140729,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1404289944,"content":"Good man Nerdmeister"}]}
