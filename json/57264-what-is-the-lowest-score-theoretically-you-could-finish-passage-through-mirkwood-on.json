Passage Through Mirkwood is a difficulty 1 quest from the core set (this is the one that you refer to , right? And yes, I can imagine score 38 for this super easy quest). On the contrary, this thread is about Return to Mirkwood, which is the 6th expansion of Mirkwood series. And no, 38 score is not possible for Return to Mirkwood."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57264-what-is-the-lowest-score-theoretically-you-could-finish-passage-through-mirkwood-on/?do=findComment&comment=565064","commentId":565064,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1323264848,"content":"plueschi said:\n\n I can engineer a turn 1 win with a score of 30.\n\n\n\nHow?

The score of 38 he was referring to happened on Passage through Mirkwood (under the new scoring system), thats why I immediately thought about Passage through Mirkwood without reading the title.\n\nI however cannot engineer a turn 1 win against Return to Mirkwood, sorry for the confusion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57264-what-is-the-lowest-score-theoretically-you-could-finish-passage-through-mirkwood-on/?do=findComment&comment=565073","commentId":565073,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1323265571,"content":"Well, maybe Bungo made a typing mistake when he was naming this thread.
