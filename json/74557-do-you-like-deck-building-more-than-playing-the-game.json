I can spend ages and ages building the perfect deck and only play it a few times, before i go back and try and improve it again.\n\nif i lose a quest a few times then that pretty much means i won't try it again until i have redone the deck. so i am always redoing the decks.\n\ni reckon i spend 75% of the time buildings decks and only 25% playing the game. thats not a moan though, because that's how i like it. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] and you dont need as much space to do decks either, you can just have a look through whilst watching the telly\n\nhow does it split up for you?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74557-do-you-like-deck-building-more-than-playing-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=726001","commentId":726001,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1353408984,"content":"yeah i guess i do, though i would add 'admiring the theme and art' to deckbuilding which i guess you do to\n\nmine would be 60% building, 40% playing\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74557-do-you-like-deck-building-more-than-playing-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=726008","commentId":726008,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1353410525,"content":" No.\n\nHowever, the game is far more enjoyable with a good deck.
