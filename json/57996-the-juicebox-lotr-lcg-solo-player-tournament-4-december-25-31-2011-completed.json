This week’s tournament takes the next step in a series of tournaments exploring the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].\n\nWill you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. Further, please refrain from using this thread for extensive theorizing and/or conversation that is not directly related to this particular tournament. Nothing against other conversations – it’s just, that’s what other threads are for. Specifically, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].\n\nAnd now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!\n\nSolo Player Tournament #4:\n\nQuest: Conflict at the Carrock\nDeck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + HfG & CotC Adventure Packs\nNumber of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck\n\nTop Ten:\n\n1. muemakan ~ 65 (Éowyn, Beravor, Thalin)\n2. wraith428 ~ 83 (Dúnhere, Éowyn, Beravor)\n3.

In round 5 I played Gandalf to get my threat below 34. I was then able to get Grimbeorn in round 6 (he already showed up in round 4, so I was prepared) and started my battle with the trolls in that round. Thanks to another Gandalf and Grim Resolve I was able to defeat the first two trolls, Rupert and Louis. I played a \"Feint\" on Louis to prevent his effect. In round 8 I engaged Morris, not after finally exploring the Carrock. I had to be careful, because I only had Théodred, Legolas (with one Dúndedain Mark), Bilbo, a Dwarven Axe Warrior, a Beekeeper, a Gondorian Spearman and a Mapmaker as my attacking forces (and Grimbeorn, of course). I only had 2 Rivendell Minstrells and a Daughter of the Nimrodel for questing, and Théodred still got one damage point that I wanted to heal. So I only 17 attacking points, and I was also engaged with a Muck Adder which got Wolf Rider as its shadow card (round 8). I lost the Spearman to the Adder and used the Axe Warrior to block the Wolf Rider. Fortunatly I drew another Gandalf in my last turn, so I had enough power to both quest and fight.\n\n \n\nIIRC, encounters were\n\nround 1: Wargs (undefended + shadow effect; Legolas hit them for 2 danage and the Spearman killed them next round; 3 damage applied to Théodred)\n\nround 2: Goblin Snipers (undefended, killed by Legolas; 2 damage applied to Legolas)\n\nround 3: River Langflood\n\nround 4: Roasted\n\nround 5: Oakwood Grove\n\nround 6: A Frightened Beast\n\nround 7: Roasted\n\nround 8: Muck Adder\n\nround 9: Wolf Rider"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57996-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-4-december-25-31-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=571252","commentId":571252,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1324834541,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\n I played a \"Feint\" on Louis to prevent his effect. \n\n\n\nWhat do you mean by this?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57996-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-4-december-25-31-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=571261","commentId":571261,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1324837264,"content":"muemakan said:\n\nleptokurt said:\n\n \n\n I played a \"Feint\" on Louis to prevent his effect. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat do you mean by this?\n\n\n\nI meant his forced effect about Troll enemies: \"After this enemy attacks, the defending player must raise his threat by 3\".

I used Gandalf three times to lower my threat. When dealing with the first two trolls I used Gandalf to damage them so that I could kill them off with Gandalf, Grimbeorn and Beravor (Beravor had two Marks and got a third at the end of the game). The three last trolls (including the Hill Troll) I could kill off in one go without damaging them beforehand with Gandalf, because then I had already explored Carrock. Actually I would have been able to kill both Rupert and the Hill Troll in the same turn with the help of Eowyn, Henamarth and a Miner, but I needed Eowyn to quest for the progress marker on 2B.

Beravor used her ability A LOT, and Gimli got boosted by 4 HP and 3x Dúndedain Mark. Got all my two Sneaks and two Gandalfs (one in the last round!).

Even if your apporach didn't work due to some rule misunderstandings, it's still a great way to solve this scenario. You could still play 3 Feints (you apparebtly have more than one coreset), suffer one attack and then kill'em all plus one more turn to explore the Carrock (in which you can play Gandalf again to lower your threat. I your example you could have got 81 points.\n\nMuemakan was asked about the number of rounds because you add the10 points at the end of each round (during the refresh phase). You had 4 rounds = 40 points which means you completed 4 rounds, being in the 5th in your last turn.

Did you have a protector of lorien?\n\nBut again, a great way of approaching the scenario.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHe didn't have to quest against the trolls because he explored 1B and engaged all the trolls in the following combat.\n\n \n\nI think Engineer quested with Théodred only, using Beravor's ability to increase his card pool. Legolas killed the Sniper for 2 progress, so he only needed 5 progress in round 4 to accomplish 1B. He had 18 cards of which he used 9. In round 4 he had to send Théodred, boosted with PoL. He had to challenge a threat of 4, so he needed 9 WP to get to stage 2B. He discarded 8 cards and had thus one single card left unused. So potentially there was at most one ally in the game.\n\nSo how did he kill the trolls? Say he had a Dwarven Axe Warrior as his ally. He must have attacked Morris first to get rid of his defense bonus. He needed an attack value of 14 to kill him. If he used Gandalf's ability on Morris, he only needed 10 attack points. Gandalf has 4 attack points, Beorn and Legolas both have 3. So Morris was toast and he used Grim Resolve. Now the order of killing the remaining trolls didn't really matter. 13 attack points were needed to kill a troll, now that Morris was gone. However, there is no possible combination that allowed him to kill a troll and add some extra damage on another troll. There's still Beorn's ability though. Say he used that on the third troll, then he only needed Beorn (8 AP), Legolas and one other character to kill the third troll.

You would only have had the exact number of resources to play a couple of Grim Resolve. And thus no allies to support your attack (ok, perhaps one lore ally). Enough attacking power to kill three trolls, but there's still one remaining. What happened to him?\n\n \n\nOr you didn't collect Grimbeorn. In that case you needed 4 allies to block the trolls. That's 4 of your 18 cards. Play SoG, PoL, 2x Sneak Attack, 2x Grim Resolve, Beorn and Gandalf, and you're down to 6 cards. You made one progress in your first turn and had to make the remaining 6 in turn 4. Théodred and Aragorn have combined 3 WP, and you had to face a threat of 5, considering that you didn't engage the Sniper. You thus needed 8 more WP, but only had 6 cards. Even by using Radagast's Cunning you needed 6 WP with only 5 cards left.\n\n \n\nWith \"Frightened\" you mean \"A Frightened Beast \", the card that would have raised your threat by 5? Plus 12 points threat were added by the attacking trolls, makes a threat of 28 + 17 = 45. Plus 4 rounds makes 49. Plus at least on turn were you failed in the quest phase, makes 50+.\n\n \n\nI hope you don't take offense, but may I ask how long you play this game?

Implied in how this is set up is that everyone be as honest as possible with themselves and with the community. No one is obligated to provide detailed reports of their quests, and if a glaring error is not evident in a reported result, a score will stand. If a mistake is made and realized later during the tournament, I would appreciate for whoever made the mistake to make a post about it so the score could be retracted. However, once a tournament is completed and “in the books” there will be no going back and readjusting scores. At that point, it’s water under the bridge. This whole system relies on everyone doing the best they can over both the short and long haul, including me – the host.\n\nThat said, as host, I rely on each participant to submit scores you believe honestly reflect the game you have played. So, specifically, in the Da_Engineer’s case (see above), there has been so much consideration (so many theoretical outcomes for how the game could have gone, posted after the fact) that I feel like I’ve lost clarity around what actually happened during the game itself. To me this starts to sound more like a theoretical game than actual game play. And while theory is fun too, I want to rank scores based on what actually happened. In this context, I think game play matters. Deck building, preparation, and in-game execution all matter. Otherwise, we wouldn't need to even play the game; we could just prepare for it and call it good.\n\nEveryone, even the “experts” here, are on a learning curve with this game, and I hope we can all continue to learn and grow in our understanding and enjoyment of LOTR LCG along the way. I hope the tournaments I host help enhance those things. I hope everyone who participates has fun. I know I’m having fun hosting.\n\nAs for the idea of posting to BGG, I think that’s a fantastic idea. While I check BGG often as a resource, I do not have my own account (by choice), and so I would welcome anyone who’s enjoying these tournaments here to post announcements and invitations on the BGG forums (with links to the FFG tournament threads) to come here and join in the tournaments.

In each round you have to make decisions about which cards to play, thereby considering most possible encounters. For example, you played Song of Wisdom in round 1, which I wouldn't have done. Why spend that resouce if you don't even know that you'd need a lore card immediatly during the next round? Should  one spare his resources to get Grimbeorn ASAP, or invest a resource just to be able to play DotN, just in case one of the few enemies with 2 attack points should enter the game in round 2? You can play both ways. Your approach apparently is to hope for the best possible encounter card to come, my approach is to cover most of the possible bad encounters that might come.\n\n \n\nBtw, you have to improve your probability calculations. If your deck should work in they way you planned it, you'd need roughly 1/4 of the cards in your deck. Even if I only consider the six cards you mentined, it's not very likely to get all of them at round 4. I simulated card draws of 18 cards, and in my 47th attempt I finally got all those six cards (but only three 2 resource meat shields). And now I still I only have to get the right encounter cards. I guess that in approx every 100th game you'll be able to play your deck to the max. And that's an optimistic calculation."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57996-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-4-december-25-31-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=572126","commentId":572126,"userName":"Da_Engineer","timestamp":1325096874,"content":"I played it because I needed a lore card in round 2 yes or else why would I play this in round 1...\n\nAlong the same lines, you keep saying that I need 1/4 my deck which is false, there's some cards I need but it's far from being 1/4.  Just the same as saying that I played Song in round 1 for no reason, without knowing why I did or what my deck has in it, you say that I need 1/4 the cards without knowing what I have in my deck...  Not sure why you need to say this or the purpose of you saying this."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57996-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-4-december-25-31-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=572178","commentId":572178,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1325112845,"content":"So that was quite a night.

So, as the refresh phase hasn't been over when Gandalf killed Morris, you didn't have to add the 10 extra points.\n\n\n\n1. He was already damaged to 4 hit points.......shadowcard reduced 2wounds .....so 6 hit points. Gandalf attacked and dealt 2 damage.....4 again. Gandalf killed it.\n\n2.

That leaves 5 resources for Sneak Attacks.\n\n \n\nCosts:\n\nBeorn x2 = 12\n\nGaladhrim's Greeting x2 = 6\n\nStand and Fight x1 = 1 (For Snow Born Scout)\n\nWill of the West x1 = 1\n\nSnow Born Scout x3 = 3\n\nSong of Kings x3 = 3\n\nSteward of Gondor x1 = 2\n\nFor Gondor x1 = 2\n\nProtector of Lorien x1 = 1\n\nTotal = 31 used.\n\n \n\nAlso know that with only 8 spirit resources the last Galadhrim's Greeting must have been played in the round 7 Refresh phase, other wise either Stand and Fight or Will of the West couldn't be played in time to be effective.  That means going into the refresh phase for round 7, 2 spirit resources were saved.  Prior to the Refresh phase of round 7, max resources are 33.  Subtract 2 for the spirit resources and you have 31 resources available for use.  Since the second Galadhrim's Greeting wasn't used yet at this point, only 28 have been used at this point not counting Sneak Attacks.  So going into the round 7 Refresh phase we have 31 resources available for use and 28 used.  This would allow for 3 Sneak Attacks prior to round 7 Refresh?\n\n \n\nSomeone check my math if you care... I think I've logiced that out right but I may have missed a detail \n\n \n\n3 Sneak Attacks prior to round 7 Refresh phase and 1 during = 4 Gandalf's.  One was used to damage the Misty Mountain Goblins in round 3.  That leaves 3 for threat reduction.  3 Gandalfs plus 6 Galadhrim's Greeting's = 27 threat reduction.  Starting Threat is 28 with these heroes plus 7 threat for 7 rounds (need to take the threat for round 7 before the action window to play cards in the Refresh Phase opens up) means 35 threat.  35 threat - 27 threat reduction = 8 Threat. \n\n \n\nSomeone check my mathhere as this seems to indicate threat 5 is unlikely and I may have missed something.  Also in the play description I believe Gandalf did a couple more Sneak Attacks for Damage.\n\n \n\nAnyways... I started this post thinking possible but improbable and in the process of thinking it through I'm beginning to lean towards unlikely but I'll be the first to admit I don't know if my conclusions above have taken in all the variables.  Really it was just fun mental math. \n\n \n\nLater,\n\n \n\nWraith428"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57996-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-4-december-25-31-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573193","commentId":573193,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1325361167,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\nApparently I do something wrong when mixing my cards, because I almost never get all the cards that I need.\n\n \n\nMuemakan, I still don't see how your game could have happened like you described it.

In round 2 I had to discard one card to put 2 progress tokens on the Banks of Anduin. Again in round 3 to get rid of the Banks. And then in round 4 to don´t sufer the one threat.\n\nI did have to discard 8 cards for the PoL to complete Stage 1.\n\nAnd at the end in round 7 I had to quest for 11. Which was quite easy as I could afford to discard nearly all of my deck.\n\nThis wash´t a joke and very serious.

That leaves 5 resources for Sneak Attacks.\n\n \n\nCosts:\n\nBeorn x2 = 12\n\nGaladhrim's Greeting x2 = 6\n\nStand and Fight x1 = 1 (For Snow Born Scout)\n\nWill of the West x1 = 1\n\nSnow Born Scout x3 = 3\n\nSong of Kings x3 = 3\n\nSteward of Gondor x1 = 2\n\nFor Gondor x1 = 2\n\nProtector of Lorien x1 = 1\n\nTotal = 31 used.\n\n \n\nAlso know that with only 8 spirit resources the last Galadhrim's Greeting must have been played in the round 7 Refresh phase, other wise either Stand and Fight or Will of the West couldn't be played in time to be effective.  That means going into the refresh phase for round 7, 2 spirit resources were saved.  Prior to the Refresh phase of round 7, max resources are 33.  Subtract 2 for the spirit resources and you have 31 resources available for use.  Since the second Galadhrim's Greeting wasn't used yet at this point, only 28 have been used at this point not counting Sneak Attacks.  So going into the round 7 Refresh phase we have 31 resources available for use and 28 used.  This would allow for 3 Sneak Attacks prior to round 7 Refresh?\n\n \n\nSomeone check my math if you care... I think I've logiced that out right but I may have missed a detail \n\n \n\n3 Sneak Attacks prior to round 7 Refresh phase and 1 during = 4 Gandalf's.  One was used to damage the Misty Mountain Goblins in round 3.  That leaves 3 for threat reduction.  3 Gandalfs plus 6 Galadhrim's Greeting's = 27 threat reduction.  Starting Threat is 28 with these heroes plus 7 threat for 7 rounds (need to take the threat for round 7 before the action window to play cards in the Refresh Phase opens up) means 35 threat.  35 threat - 27 threat reduction = 8 Threat. \n\n \n\nSomeone check my mathhere as this seems to indicate threat 5 is unlikely and I may have missed something.  Also in the play description I believe Gandalf did a couple more Sneak Attacks for Damage.\n\n \n\nAnyways... I started this post thinking possible but improbable and in the process of thinking it through I'm beginning to lean towards unlikely but I'll be the first to admit I don't know if my conclusions above have taken in all the variables.  Really it was just fun mental math. \n\n \n\nLater,\n\n \n\nWraith428\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBeorn did cost nothing, as did every Gandalf that was sneaked, thanks to Horn of Gondor. I just need the resource to play it and at the end the one resource comes back to Eowyn.  This counts too for every Snowbourn Scout I played, because they all dead sooner or later. SoG is also free as he produces the resources he costs.\n\nThe GG did indeed cost 6 resources.  so from your above list only 13 resources remain. \n\nAs I know now by looking at my video again I did draw 3 cards with my firs Gandalf and didn´t kill the Goblins......they were killed by Gandalf with an attack.\n\nGandalf was used 5 times for threat reduction along with 2 GG. 42 threat-37 threat leaves 5.\n\n7 rounds, 3 from the attack of louis, and 4 from questing in round 7.........14+28= 42 threat.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57996-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-4-december-25-31-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573665","commentId":573665,"userName":"Da_Engineer","timestamp":1325497286,"content":"Dam said:\n\nDa_Engineer said:\n\nI think it's an error to have 55, you should always have 50 imo, I don't see any situation where 55 would be necessary because not every card is as good as the next and you're making it harder to get your best cards by having 55.  Just a suggestion.\n\n \n\nThen again, I have 2 Core Sets split into four decks that initially used all 12 Core Heroes (Thalin has since made way for Brand, other 11 are still the Core heroes), so they are by no means min-maxed to the fullest.
