The logos used in the rules and on Journey in the Black Pit and Continuing Eastward are for The Long Dark, Twists and Turns, and Deeps of Moria. However, the rules state that we should use The Long Dark, Twists and Turns, and Hazards of the Pit. Which are the correct encounter sets for The Long Dark?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197567-encounter-sets-for-the-long-dark/?do=findComment&comment=1970613","commentId":1970613,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1451922539,"content":"FFG published an article addressing this:\n\nhttps://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2012/5/21/stars-clarity-and-foundations-of-stone/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2012/5/21/stars-clarity-and-foundations-of-stone/]"}]}
