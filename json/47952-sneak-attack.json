I really cannot see having a Leadership Hero and not having 3 Sneak Attack and 3 Gandalf cards. With those numbers you usually do not need many other allies to Sneak. Beorn is definitelly number 2 choice, I'd say, sometimes even more preferable (especially when you have the Steward and thus a decent chance to play Gandalf normally the next round). Choice number 3 would be Son of Arnor perhaps, to engage enemy after enemy attack step is very good. And then the three progress machines, the Scout, well it is a nice combo, but I actually decided to exclude the Scout from my deck - perhaps a bad idea, not sure yet. Northern Tracker and Faramir can be sneaked in need to give you a serious progress boost.\n\nThere is an obvious combo in shape and form of Ever Vigilant that works wonders with Sneak Attack. I just love these two Leadership Events. It's great to have cheap and powerful cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47952-sneak-attack/?do=findComment&comment=481348","commentId":481348,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1307380259,"content":"signoftheserpent said:\n\nGandalf is discarded from play.
