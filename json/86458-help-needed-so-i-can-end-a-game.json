It´s just an effect that happens and then it´s discarded, so treacheries are not added to the SA. Now for your 2nd question i think it depends on the wording of the card.

As you said the events/treacheries are happening instantly and then discarded. I believer if the effect would apply to all new enemies/locations it would mention it directly.\n\nEDIT: Yes, it will only effect the cards already in the SA. I just read the unofficial FAQ and the explanations there are either official rule explanations or the way the majority plays it.
