I ask because in another thread I learned about this possibility but I'm courious about if it's to be prefered over lowering your threat by other means. All this is of cause regarding the secrecy mechanic. And does anyone know if Nate has clearifyed that you can use less than 3 heroes? I know the rules only state max 3 heroes and mentions nothing about the minimum but rules has been interpreted \"wrong\" before. Don't really wanna experiment with something new if it's \"illigal\" you know :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73496-3-or-less-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=716568","commentId":716568,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1351572865,"content":"i replied in the other, but i shall do here also\n\nthe idea of secrecy is really to use less heros- so it is indeed allowed, and i say expected. glorfindel for example is a good secrecy hero, as is frodo and elanor and all those 7s.\n\nas for the experience i have not tried it- secrecy is not developed for it to be all that useful in a solo game yet, there arent that many cards and some of them arent that good.\n\nsome are though, and i expect secrecy will become more useful as we go on\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73496-3-or-less-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=716584","commentId":716584,"userName":"OnkelZorni","timestamp":1351576911,"content":"I just played a single-hero deck against Passage through Mirkwood.

Maybe we will find in \"Heirs of Numenor\" adventures where Secrecy decks may fit.\n\nI tried building two Heroes decks, but without good results. You lose a lot of speed (resourcess) and options to build decks (need to use cheaper cards and practically limited to two spheres). That isn't a good trade just for some turns avoiding engaging Enemies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73496-3-or-less-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=716606","commentId":716606,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1351581003,"content":"I have run a Brand/Legolas deck in 2 player - keeping threat low so that enemies only engage the other player and the ranged keyword allows you to fight them, I believe I ran it with Radagast and the eagles, though I didn't have the resourceful card at the time, If I built it again I'd probably go with non-eagle reds.\n\nIt looks like the 2nd pack in the new cycle would help it a lot to be good actually.\n\n \n\nI quite like the idea of Glorfindel and Frodo in a mono-blue deck for solo as well tbh.
