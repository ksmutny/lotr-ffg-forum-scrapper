It had same stats and text as some of the existing enemy cards in the core set (most probably bats, but I don't remember for sure). I was foolish enough not to save the image and now I'm desperate - I've searched all over the internet and can't find it. Does anybody happen to possess the whereabouts of this image or anything of simmiliar interest? (like Marsh Adder with \"Stealth\" keyword, or Thorin who spends his damage tokens as resources)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1015401","commentId":1015401,"userName":"Scroll Lock","timestamp":1395064791,"content":"you probably are not searching for this, but just to be sure, I will post it here.\n\nspirit-of-the-wild.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-ringmaker/cards/spirit-of-the-wild.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1015554","commentId":1015554,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1395072045,"content":"Nope, the time I found the card I was talking about was prior to announcement even of Voice of Isengard.\n\n \n\nHere some examples of old outdated cards:\n\n \n\nmonster-card-fan.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/monster-card-fan.png]\n\n \n\nhttp://stat16.privet.ru/lr/0b01f865e8b8cadd653784d77ddf41d0 [http://stat16.privet.ru/lr/0b01f865e8b8cadd653784d77ddf41d0]\n\nEdited March 17, 2014 by MyNeighbourTrololo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1015580","commentId":1015580,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1395073185,"content":"Oh, I found the proof I'm not mad!\n\n \n\nlotrff01.jpg [http://www.robotviking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/lotrff01.jpg]\n\nYou can see him on this photo, near Aragorn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1016872","commentId":1016872,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1395166447,"content":"I think it was called Mirkwood Wight..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1016885","commentId":1016885,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1395167272,"content":"Oh yeah, finally found him!\n\n \n\n \n\ngEWFUbaPtg8.jpg [http://cs14102.vk.me/c614718/v614718009/8550/gEWFUbaPtg8.jpg]\n\n \n\nHere you can see Wight himself, as well as Ungoloian Spawn having art of Caught in the Web.\n\n \n\n8BtMa6_Ati8.jpg [http://cs14102.vk.me/c614718/v614718009/8559/8BtMa6_Ati8.jpg]\n\n \n\nAnd here we can see that Snowbourn Scout was previously a Rider of Rohan and had a paid ability to add progress to the locations, Gloin were Thorin (with a weaker version of his ability), and Valiant Sacrifice had far neater from my point of view art."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1016914","commentId":1016914,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1395168683,"content":"interesting, thanks for finding these!

Aragorn would have been too strong, surely, especially in the core set times. Even with the shaft, I think he was the favourite core hero, without it, he would have been for everyone. I also remember Gandalf, he had actually been much worse. The cost was six and the response could only be triggered when played from hand, so Sneak Attack would have been useless for that. The only positive difference was that he got rid of an enemy right away - which would not have lasted long till errata, anyway."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1017870","commentId":1017870,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1395214011,"content":"Well, of all, I still think that Gandalf should be errata'd to the \"When you play Gandalf from your hand\" because it's just borderline overpowered and kills gameplay of the sneak attack. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1017882","commentId":1017882,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1395214487,"content":"Could be.

If the response were only after playing from hand, two things would probably happen: Hobbit Gandalf would be much more prominent version, and more trials Sneak Attacking with other allies (but the options there are not so great still).\n\nI think those two would be balanced. Because core Gandalf brings big boost with him despite being one-rounder, while hobbit Gandalf is lingering but not all can handle the threat. Right now, I'tll be luck if hobbit Gandalf is used at least 10% of the times core one is used.\n\nAs for the sneak attack(would core Gandalf get erratad), think of it: You get any character from your hand on your side for the entire phase by paying just 1 resource (which can be refunded if you happen to possess Horn of Gondor)! Beorn, Bork Ironfist, Gandalf himself(no goodies on enter, but getting ally with dat stat block for 1 phase by paying 1 resource is still hella useful), Gildor, Landroval(you can combo this with Boromir, btw) and else, else, else. The Sneak Attack would become what it meant to be.\n\nCharacters with Discard to effect, like Damrod, could have been included in an out-of-sphere deck just for the purpose of sneak attack. Thing would be more interesting without Gandalf-Sneak Attack leadership no-brainer.\n\nEdited March 19, 2014 by MyNeighbourTrololo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1018624","commentId":1018624,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1395253624,"content":"You cannot combo Landroval with Tactics Boromir, if you mean the discard action, discard does not mean destroy.\n\nOtherwise, I do agree, finding new tricks for Sneak Attack, or any card for that matter, is a good thing. It is exactly why I was happy when Stand and Fight became unable to bring Gandalf back.\n\nAs for Gandalf (core) vs. Gandalf (Hobbit), my experience is far from such imbalance. The latter can be so effective, the threat prize is not that terrible for many a deck, or even quicker quests, and it gets better if you can find a way to overcome the resource cost (Elf-stone, Vilya)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101509-scrapped-card-version/?do=findComment&comment=1018848","commentId":1018848,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1395260728,"content":"Ok, lack of precise wording knowledge regarding Landroval on my part here...
