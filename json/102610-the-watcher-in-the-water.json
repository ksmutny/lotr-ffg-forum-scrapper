Thrashing tentacle is the worst.\n\n \n\nThe answer to the problem was found in the guest article on difficulty ratings on Tales from the cards:\n\n \n\nhttp://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/lotr-rants-difficulty-rating/ [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/16/lotr-rants-difficulty-rating/]\n\n \n\nBasically, some way to look at the top card of the encounter deck will help with those nasty tentacle effects. I found it a bit disappointing that both ways to defeat the quest rely on the same trick, rather than providing a real option, but that's what it is. Also this really isn't helped by the German translation that (as far as I can tell) seriously shifts the distribution of first letters."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102610-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1030778","commentId":1030778,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1396037110,"content":"If you have the Beorn hero, he eats tentacles for breakfast."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102610-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1030781","commentId":1030781,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1396037180,"content":"I like to play here: Denethor hero, and Hernamanth... to see when i can attack to tentacles, and how to go into the Door."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102610-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1030857","commentId":1030857,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1396040179,"content":"I like taking Boromir and Defending and killing all tentacles all by him."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102610-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1030951","commentId":1030951,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1396044206,"content":"OP - Do you only have the expansions up until Watcher?  Boromir is a good idea.  I did pretty well back in the day using Elladan & Elrohir."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102610-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1031115","commentId":1031115,"userName":"camacazio","timestamp":1396059385,"content":"The tentacles still cause problems for attackers and defenders no matter how well you plan. I love this quest for just that reason; I find that it can still be a meat grinder even if I use some of my best deck ideas. I always find that luck plays a big part, but I never feel like it is irritating when I get some bad luck unlike some treacheries or shadow effects that just randomly kill everybody. It's great to have an unsolvable quest. It's a giant octopus, too, I love the idea that you are asking for trouble by just going near his lake."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102610-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1031200","commentId":1031200,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1396073507,"content":"I also wonder how they will alter this encounter in actual Lord of the Rings saga."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102610-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1031204","commentId":1031204,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1396074508,"content":"hmmm never see any problems with this quest..... very boring and easy in my opinion. very important is time. time when you move from stage to stage. you must be ready to meet a Watcher. all others is just a matter of time. but maybe problem is your deck?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102610-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1031212","commentId":1031212,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1396076988,"content":"If playing multi-player or 2 decks solo, I can recommend Brand.\n\nUse hands on the bow for the staging area to dispatch tentacles before they attack.\n\nUse Straight shot to kill off tentacles right away, as most are not unique & have 0 defense.\n\nAnd if you do so at the other end of the table, you get to ready a hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102610-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1031233","commentId":1031233,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1396081179,"content":"Thanks for good tips ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\nPs: Where i can get Beorn (hero)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102610-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1031243","commentId":1031243,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1396082155,"content":"> Thanks for good tips ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n> \n>  \n> \n> Ps: Where i can get Beorn (hero)\n\nHe's in the first Hobbit expansion (Over Hill and under Hill).\n\n \n\nTactics Boromir is even better IMO.
