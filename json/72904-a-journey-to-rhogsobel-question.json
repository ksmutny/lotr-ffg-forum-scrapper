You can do this by Snowbourn Scout, Nothern Tracker or Asfaloth.\n\n \n\nAnd this is possible because the stages don't instruct you to travel to Rhosgobel. Only the card says that you cannot travel to it before stage 1b is completed. It doesn't say you can explore it.\n\n \n\nSo you can stay in stage 1b and heal Wilyador to an extent that you can in 1 turn complete stage 2b and completely heal Wilyador.\n\n \n\n@MyNeighbourTrololo: I did my answer yesterday without seeing the cards, so for that sorry"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72904-a-journey-to-rhogsobel-question/?do=findComment&comment=711524","commentId":711524,"userName":"player543086","timestamp":1350554541,"content":"I admit I did not see this \"loop hole\".

And stalling the game increases your score which is bad if you track your score. For me it was the faster - the better.
