What if I wanted to add some cards and replace some cards in the starter deck, will it still be minimum of 30 cards?  Or can I only add cards to the starter deck to make it 50 cards?  In other words, for a  non-tournament deck can I have a 30-deck with 3 copies of each card (basically only 10 cards/3 copies of each)?  Or is there even a minimum deck size for non-tournament decks?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53083-deck-size/?do=findComment&comment=539726","commentId":539726,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1318245162,"content":"The minimum deck size is 50, no matter how you are playing.
