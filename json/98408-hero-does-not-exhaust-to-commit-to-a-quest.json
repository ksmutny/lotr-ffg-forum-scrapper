Both Glorfindel and Gandalf must be ready in order to commit to the quest.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98408-hero-does-not-exhaust-to-commit-to-a-quest/?do=findComment&comment=973468","commentId":973468,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1391518422,"content":"Yeah, I remember having a long discussion with guys on my forum with the Watcher of the Bruinen...\n\nI end up with the same kind of official answer."}]}
