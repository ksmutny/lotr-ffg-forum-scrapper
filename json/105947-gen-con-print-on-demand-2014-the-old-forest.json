So calling a quest \"bad\" just because it doesn't fits your taste is sort of selfish and ignorant. Just to be clear, this statement is not directly to you, but to all SoE haters out there.\n\nI don't think it's selfish and ignorant. I am saying for me it's a bad quest and I listed reasons why. If other players like to play lesser decks that are more thematic then that's great for them. Just like a movie critic who dislikes a movie isn't being selfish - I am just giving my opinion that I think is not an isolated one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105947-gen-con-print-on-demand-2014-the-old-forest/?do=findComment&comment=1082955","commentId":1082955,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1399983642,"content":"You quoted this phrase \"Yes doesn matter how you look on it SOE is a bad quest and im pretty sure sells nymber pretty few.....\" and agreed with it. There is no \"for me\", there is \"no matter how you look on it\", which implies all people who like this quest are wrong.\n\nEdited May 13, 2014 by MyNeighbourTrololo"}]}
