Let me tell you what has happened each time.\n\n \n\n1) During setup, setup mind you not questing setup, Ungoliant's Spawn is flipped over. \n\n \n\n2) During setup, King Spider is flipped over. During the FIRST questing phase, Ungoliant's Spawn is flipped over.\n\n \n\n3) During setup a Hill Troll and Attercop, Attercop are flipped over.\n\n \n\nAt this point I am tempted to stack the encounter deck just so I can get past the first questing phase.\n\n \n\nUgh.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109380-return-to-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=1132755","commentId":1132755,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1403705027,"content":"I still think that Attercop, Attercop is an extremely poorly designed card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109380-return-to-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=1132759","commentId":1132759,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1403705273,"content":"Wow.

Tragic did a play though just recently and owned it twice in a row using just the Mirkwood Cycle cards. I used his deck after and beat it 4 times in a row.\n\nThe key is Denathor. Scry the deck every time, get UC on him. You want to leave threats in the staging area that are not \"it will end the game\".\n\nCheck out Tragic's Deck here - Retrun to Mirkwood @ CGDB [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/7518-the-tragic-quests-of-middle-earth-lets-play/?p=91529]\n\nAs for the \"2 handed vs solo\" thing.. I prefer solo as it is so much more challenging in deck design and piloting, but there is no question this game is designed for 2 players and CAN be played with different numbers. The quest, especially the early ones function better in 2 player.. there is no doubt.\n\nThat being said building a deck to own a quest solo, that is where the real challenge is. You see people getting nightmare quests and owning it day 1 with out editing their decks.. they are probably NOT playing solo :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Solo takes real thought and planning. It is why this game is so good."}]}
