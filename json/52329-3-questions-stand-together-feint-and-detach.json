So what is the purpose of \"stand together\"? Is this card only for taking advantage of game text? E.G. \"Gondorian Spearman\" Response: After Gondorian Spearman is declared as a defender, deal 1 damage to the attacking enemy.\"\n\nSecond Question:\n\n\"Feint\" Combat Action: Choose an enemy engaged with a player. That enemy can not attack this phase.\n\nIf \"Feint\" is played during first action phase in turn sequence 6 (Combat Phase) then I assume shadow card never flips since it is part of resolving enemy attack and it is simply put in the discard pile?\n\nThird Question:\n\nThe three objectives in the Quests \"Escape from Dol Guldur\" all have \"If detached return xyz to the staging area.\" Are there currently any cards available that would give hero the option to 'detach' the objective after it has outlived its usefulness and the detrimental effects are hampering advancement?\n\nThank you all in advance for your time and attention.\n\nPeace\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52329-3-questions-stand-together-feint-and-detach/?do=findComment&comment=521308","commentId":521308,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1314579534,"content":"I'm pretty sure that with Stand Together the point is to add all the defenses up.
