Necklace of Girion gives the +2 WP, is neutral, non-restricted and gives an extra resource. I find that's going to be a little more versatile than a restricted, lore guarded card. However, it fishes for a location, which usually is more beneficial in solo play. Plus, if you play with bilbo or cirdan, you can get card draw equivalent to an erestor deck. \n\nAs for the doomed cards, it scales in power with the more players you have. Which is great because nobody wants to play with someone playing a doomed deck. The more benefits for players across the board, the better. It rounds out the leadership and lore bonus cards from earlier packs -- we now have doomed cards that allows all players to: \n\n-Ready characters\n\n-gain resources\n\n-draw cards\n\n-place damage\n\nThat combined with the new 40+threat bonuses (but let's not call it valour for whatever reason??) And you might see new play for doomed cards in decks not involving saruman."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304267-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3868703","commentId":3868703,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1578779812,"content":"Thats a good point about the guarded card being restricted. However restricted tends to only really matter on your combat characters as they are more likely to use up their restricted slots.\n\nNecklace of Girion is a pretty close match for sure.

The quest has you discard cards really quickly. It also starts you off with one of 4 nasty side-quests, and a tough enemy that limits your progress per round to 5. You need to go to the side-quests to lower the number of cards you discard at the end of each round, but that does also mean you lose rounds of progress that could have gone on the main quest. \nNot to mention the other deadly enemies in this quest. The Patrol that starts in play has Hill-Troll level stats, but has a higher defence and will make 2 attacks against you in the round you engage it. There are 2 copies and a location that fetches them when it is explored (as they don't go to the VD). With side-quests forcing you to travel and limiting damage on enemies to 4 per round, it feels very unfair to solo players, as there is no chance to get through the quest fast enough while discarding cards and having to fight off these big enemies (Trolls, Nameless Things, Werewolves, etc). \nIt's a very brutal quest, but I would imagine it to be easier in higher player counts, as one player can engage the patrol and the rest can quest hard to get through the 25 quest points on each quest card before the decks dry up. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304267-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3926850","commentId":3926850,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1586722060,"content":"I have not acquired this quest yet, but could you not just build a deck with more than 50 cards to buy extra rounds?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304267-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3926860","commentId":3926860,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1586725366,"content":"> 54 minutes ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> I have not acquired this quest yet, but could you not just build a deck with more than 50 cards to buy extra rounds?\n\nDuring setup it has you discard cards from your deck until you're down to 40.

However, the resources spent to get this up and running won't be spent to counter the big enemies in this quest, so you might die that way. Like I said, the quest is very tricky and I will encourage multiplayer just to divide the tasks a little better. I will also be looking forward to trying this with my mono-Lore deck and cycling The Great Hunt to get rid of the Patrol that way.

If one deck could beat every encounter easily the people who play often would get bored. \n\nI do agree that its a disheartening feeling when playing a block of content sequentially to have a deck your excited to play, only for the encounter you set unto have X invalidate Y and ruin your decks performance- Such as testing a trap deck and being against the Hurons who cant have attachments. \n\nI think the ideal is for an encounter to have a chance of being beaten by most decent decks, or require a few minor card swaps- But I am glad that unique deck building quests exist as well as insane challenge quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304267-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3928136","commentId":3928136,"userName":"rhtm70","timestamp":1587061623,"content":"> On 4/14/2020 at 3:28 AM, Yepesnopes said:\n> \n> I really don’t like to have to build dedicated decks to beat a quest.\n\nI can understand both sides of this debate as I have certain heroes that I like to play and it's disheartening to think against certain quests they are almost unplayable. However, I see the other side that if every group of heroes and every sphere could beat every quest then it would just be a matter of deciphering how to play certain combinations of cards and there wouldn't really be a need for different spheres except for flavor.\n\nOne solution for this that I've seen is the Book of Elessar series of playthroughs on YouTube in which he plays through all the quests using Aragorn but changes the other heroes and the deck based on the quest.
