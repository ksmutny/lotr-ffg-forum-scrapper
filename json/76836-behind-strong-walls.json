Basically, it’s written backwards from how I typically write my effects, so I was having a hard time seeing it that way. In any case, I need to revise my previous ruling about Behind Strong Walls.

It is as if he is parsing it like the card was written as follows:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Action: Choose a defending Gondor character. Ready that character. That character gains +1 [defense] until the end of the round.\n\ni.e., that it's really two separate effects occurring sort of in parallel.\n\nWhy precisely FoA is not treated the same way is, I think we can all agree, rather confusing, but my presumption is that it's the specific \"[cost] to [effect]\" wording of its 1st sentence. I'd be curious to see how Caleb would respond if pressed on this point.\n\nFor easy reference:\n\nFlame-of-Anor.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Road-Darkens/Flame-of-Anor.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3199207","commentId":3199207,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1517776443,"content":"Oh, I see.

I agree with you that the intention of BSW is that you ready the defending character, that is why my initial answer was that the defending character must be exhausted to be a legal target. However, as I examined the language closer with my coworkers, it became clear that the language on the card does not target an ‘exhausted’ defending Gondor character - just a defending Gondor character. Therefore, it is not a requirement that they be exhausted.\n> It’s not a surprise to me that I made a past ruling for Flame of Anor that conflicts with my current BSW ruling because it was only after the recent conversation I mentioned that I realized these events do not explicitly target exhausted characters. So I must reverse my FoA ruling as well to say that you can play it on a ready Istari character. \n> Cheers,\n> Caleb\n\n \n\n> Quote\n> \n> Hi Caleb,\n> glad that you are thinking about another revision.\n> But i hoped our conversation goes into the other direction. \n> That it is mandatory to ready a character if an event or attachment  (like Amored Destrier) tell you to ready one. \n> Regards, \n> Jan \n\n \n\n> Quote\n> \n> Hi Jan,\n> Armored Destrier uses the word ‘then’ in its structure, so you have to ready the attached character in order to discard the shadow card.

It's not that Caleb ruled that you can ready a ready character; his ruling is about targeting and the applicability of a second sentence using \"that character\" in compound effects.\n\nThus, each of your examples that purely ready—e.g., Boromir, Cram, ally Glorfindel—cannot be used as you say, since they have no effect other than to ready some character. Spare Hood shouldn't be valid either, as its second sentence starts with \"Then\".\n\nIn other words, you can't pay the costs to do something if there would be no effect OTHER than the cost payment.\n\nIt would indeed be a boost to Narya, Tale of Tinuviel, Taste It Again!, and Boomed & Trumpeted compared to how I'd been playing them, though.\n\nEdited February 7, 2018 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3203577","commentId":3203577,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1518016473,"content":"Caleb's explanation above just mentions that Behind Strong Walls can target a ready Gondor character because it doesn't explicitly state that the character needs to be exhausted.  He repeated that point when discussing Flame of Anor, but didn't mention a secondary effect as requisite for that point to remain true.  So currently it seems that you can do all of the things I typed above.  \n\nIf your deck is empty, I wonder can you play Mithrandir's Advice?  Same idea here, paying a cost for no effect.\n\n(whoops, you're right, no Cram on allies, but Spare Hood & Cloak and Born Aloft are 0-point attachments that would also work, should we ever see a Dale ally that is returned to hand)\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3203583","commentId":3203583,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1518016863,"content":"> 4 minutes ago, GrandSpleen said:\n> \n> Caleb's explanation above just mentions that Behind Strong Walls can target a ready Gondor character because it doesn't explicitly state that the character needs to be exhausted.  He repeated that point when discussing Flame of Anor, but didn't mention a secondary effect as requisite for that point to remain true.  So currently it seems that you can do all of the things I typed above.  \n\nI disagree on your interpretation of Caleb's words, but I'm sending in a specific query to see if you can ready a ready character in lieu of other effects."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3203635","commentId":3203635,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1518019404,"content":" \n\n> Quote\n> \n> My ruling regarding Behind Strong Walls and Flame of Anor was not to say that you can ready character who is already ready.
