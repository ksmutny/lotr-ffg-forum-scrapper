But one hour later i received a new email from Caleb:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Hi Jan,\n> We had a long discussion in the department about your rules question. The long and short of it is that I was basing my ruling off the idea that Behind Strong Walls is targeting an exhausted Gondor defender, but the other guys in the department pointed out that “ready” is the effect and “defending Gondor character” is the target. Basically, it’s written backwards from how I typically write my effects, so I was having a hard time seeing it that way. In any case, I need to revise my previous ruling about Behind Strong Walls. The answer is: “Yes, you can play Behind Strong Walls to give a ready Gondor defender +1 DEF because its only targeting requirement is that the defending character has the Gondor trait.” Sorry for the confusion.\n> Cheers,\n> Caleb\n\nSo .. in the end .. you can play Behind Strong Walls on a defending Gondor-character which is not exhausted... :-(\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3198000","commentId":3198000,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1517669082,"content":"This would also mean that you can use Flame of Anor on Gandalf even if he is not ready.  That has previously been ruled illegal (thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175430-poisoned-counselsgandalfhobbit-pipes/]).  \n\nWe might end up seeing this ruling reversal getting reversed.  \"Ready a defending Gondor character\" pretty clearly indicates you need to have a character who can be readied.  So...he needs to be exhausted.  If the card said 'Exhaust a defending Gondor character' we would perceive that as the cost, but since 'readying' is a positive effect, we don't perceive it that way.  Even though the wording would be identical.

I think you should not be able to \"ready\" a ready character. That character must refer to  the character you just readied, which will be no one; therefore leaving no legal target.\n\nThe disconnect here may be that, for FoA, you are correct—\"that character\" refers to the Istari that was readied by the first part of the effect, and the ruling agrees with the general principle that indeed you cannot ready a character that is not exhausted.\n\nBut, per Caleb's last ruling above, for BSW, \"that character\" merely refers to a defending Gondor character. It is as if he is parsing it like the card was written as follows:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Action: Choose a defending Gondor character. Ready that character. That character gains +1 [defense] until the end of the round.\n\ni.e., that it's really two separate effects occurring sort of in parallel.\n\nWhy precisely FoA is not treated the same way is, I think we can all agree, rather confusing, but my presumption is that it's the specific \"[cost] to [effect]\" wording of its 1st sentence. I'd be curious to see how Caleb would respond if pressed on this point.\n\nFor easy reference:\n\nFlame-of-Anor.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Road-Darkens/Flame-of-Anor.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3199207","commentId":3199207,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1517776443,"content":"Oh, I see.
