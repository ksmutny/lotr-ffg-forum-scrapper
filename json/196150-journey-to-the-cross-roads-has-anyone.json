I'll also check the Leadermir, Damrod and Sam deck! Thanks for the suggestions!\n\n \n\nThis quest and Nightmare Journey Down the Anduin made me sware (a nice mix of english and French Canadian bad words) out loud at the game. This one is super annoying, and some of the shadow effects... \"put under the Black gate or it makes another attack\"... AAAARRGGH!!!\n\nEdited December 18, 2015 by Lecitadin"}]}
