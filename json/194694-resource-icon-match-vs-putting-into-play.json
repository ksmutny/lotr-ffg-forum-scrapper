The cards I'm intending to play all have a \"put into play\" effect. My question can you put the the following cards into play without a resource match? \n\n \n\nCurious-Brandybuck.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Wastes-of-Eriador/Curious-Brandybuck.jpg]Elven-Jeweler.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Escape-from-Mount-Gram/Elven-Jeweler.jpg]Emery.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Blood-of-Gondor/Emery.png]\n\n \n\nTo clarify, this question is for putting these cards in play by their Action/Response. Not by purchasing them during the planning phase.\n\n \n\nGr,\n\nJban\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194694-resource-icon-match-vs-putting-into-play/?do=findComment&comment=1912845","commentId":1912845,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1448903382,"content":"You can put them into play without a resource match.\n\n \n\nGood luck doing so with Emery though! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  If you're running a deck without any spirit hero, you probably have more than a few cards from other spheres in there (although if you're looking just to exploit her deck discard ability, that will work fine)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194694-resource-icon-match-vs-putting-into-play/?do=findComment&comment=1912851","commentId":1912851,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1448903579,"content":"I think yes, because in each case you are filling the cost and not playing them normally.\n\n \n\nAs GrandSpleen say though, how to do it with Emery is tricky!

You don't need a resource match. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Here's his reply:\n\n \n\n\"A resource match is require to play a card, but you do not need a resource match to put a card into play. Therefore, you do not need a resource match to trigger the Response effect on Curious Brandybuck.\n\nCheers,\nCaleb\""}]}
