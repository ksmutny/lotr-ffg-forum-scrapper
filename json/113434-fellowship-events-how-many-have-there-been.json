Is the Barrow Downs one coming in October the first that hasn't been? Or are were there more Fellowship Event scenarios that aren't now Print On Demand?\n\nÂ \n\nAlso how long after Gen-Con does the convention scenario become available for the rest of us?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113434-fellowship-events-how-many-have-there-been/?do=findComment&comment=1204096","commentId":1204096,"userName":"Odweller","timestamp":1408149422,"content":"I'm curious as well. I see there is an alt-art Aragorn promo in the upcoming October event.

I'm also curious about whether the Barrow Downs scenario and Aragorn card will be available from Print on Demand after October. I'll be disappointed if the only way to obtain these cards is to attend the event, since I can't guarantee my schedule will allow me to take part."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113434-fellowship-events-how-many-have-there-been/?do=findComment&comment=1206684","commentId":1206684,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1408246765,"content":"I'm sure down the track it'll be print on demand.
