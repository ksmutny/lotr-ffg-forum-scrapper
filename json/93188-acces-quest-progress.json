The question came up during Journey down Anduin. The card state players can not defeat this stage while any Hill Troll cards are in play.\n\nSituation is Hill Troll is in play but with forest snare on it so it can not attack and thus we have time to built up attack force to defeat it. Meanwhile we have enough willpower to win during quest phase. Does the quest cards text be interrupted as we can not do progress yet until the Hill Troll is defeated or can we make progress? In that case what happens when we reach the 8 quest damage points needed? Where does the access damage go to, does it stack up and when the Hill Trol is defeated it goes over to the next main questcard 2a/b? Wih the access damage it could be completed right away as well?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93188-acces-quest-progress/?do=findComment&comment=904269","commentId":904269,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1383846032,"content":"the excess builds up until the troll is killed. you cannot go to 2b until it is dead. however unlike locations, progress from quest cards do not spill over\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93188-acces-quest-progress/?do=findComment&comment=904283","commentId":904283,"userName":"Cuendillar2","timestamp":1383846955,"content":"Thank You for your reply Richsabre. Maybe you know the awnser on a progress related question as well. With Northern Trackers you can deal 1 progress token in lands in the staging area. Say the land has reached the max progress it can have. Do you resolve by discarding them immediately, before quest phase resolving so they don't count as threat strength or after it so they do still count but taken out after and thus take profit of it next round?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93188-acces-quest-progress/?do=findComment&comment=904291","commentId":904291,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1383847352,"content":"no problem :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\na location is discarded as soon as it has enough progress on it (unless it says otherwise)\n\nso if a card needs 5 progress, and you have 4 at the start of the round. tracker then commits to quest giving 1 progress giving you the 5 you need. the card is discarded and does not count towards the quest threat that round\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93188-acces-quest-progress/?do=findComment&comment=904304","commentId":904304,"userName":"Cuendillar2","timestamp":1383847974,"content":"Thank you for your quick reply Richsabre, I appreciate it.\n\nI was playing with my brother and the first quest went well so when we were through the 3 parts we decided to continue with the second quest. We weren't sure how it works correctly. We kept the hits and resource tokens and cards in hand and allies played, as well as attachments. Creatures on table we took away and attachments on them discarded. Is this the correct way?
