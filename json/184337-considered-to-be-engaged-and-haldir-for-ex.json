Not 100% but pretty sure this is the case.\n\n \n\nAs for the rangers I am assuming no because you did not truly engage an enemy you are simply considered to be engaged for other purposes (again so it can both attack you and stay in staging).\n\nEdited August 6, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184337-considered-to-be-engaged-and-haldir-for-ex/?do=findComment&comment=1723119","commentId":1723119,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1438868051,"content":"I think with Haldir you can use his ability (because you have not actually engaged an enemy that round) but you can't use it against the enemy you are \"considered to be engaged with\".\n\n \n\nSupport: the FAQ\n\n(1.50) “Considered to be engaged” vs actual engagement\n\nAn enemy that does not leave the staging area but is considered to be engaged with a player does not actually engage that player, nor does that player engage it. In order for a player to engage an enemy, the enemy card must physically enter his play area.\n\n \n\nMablung definitely doesn't work - this is also covered in the FAQ:\n\n \n\nFor example: Durin’s Bane (D 150) cannot leave the staging area and is considered to be engaged with two players. Player 1 has Mablung (RM 84) and wishes to trigger his Response effect, but he cannot because he has not actually engaged Durin’s Bane. Player 2 wishes to play Feint (CORE 34) to prevent Durin’s Bane from attacking him. He can, because Durin’s Bane is considered to be engaged with him."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184337-considered-to-be-engaged-and-haldir-for-ex/?do=findComment&comment=1723304","commentId":1723304,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1438874064,"content":"Yeah, since it has been confirmed that Mablung and similar effects don't work for enemies considered to be engaged, logically it follows that Haldir does still work in such circumstances."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184337-considered-to-be-engaged-and-haldir-for-ex/?do=findComment&comment=1723983","commentId":1723983,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1438895709,"content":"And how about when it is 'put into play this enemy engaged with you'?
