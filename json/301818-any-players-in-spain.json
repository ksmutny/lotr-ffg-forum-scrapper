I'm from Spain, I live quite near to Barcelona (about an hour and a half away from it), but if we don't have any compromises, me and my girlfriend will be happy to go to Barcelona to meet you and play some games with you. Also, I'm quite sure that some other players would be interested. There's a zone in Barcelona with a few specialized stores, and some of them have rooms enabled for playing board games.  Anyway, if you and your family, by any chance, get closer to Figueres (where the Dali Museum is), let me know it, this is the town where I live !\n\nIn fact, every year, when we are getting closer to the Spanish LOTR LCG players gathering, some players of the zone use to meet there a few weeks before, to test our decks for the gathering. I'm quite sure your visit will be an equally interesting incentive to gather those same players !!\n\nWe'll be waiting for your response !!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301818-any-players-in-spain/?do=findComment&comment=3823393","commentId":3823393,"userName":"Dieter Van Hertz","timestamp":1573131684,"content":"Hello Beorn!\n\nI am from Spain too. My family and I live in Mallorca, but for Christmas we are going to Granada to visit the family.

It will be a pleasure for me if we can met. There is only a day that we coincide. We are in Villanueva Mesía, a little town near city Granada. Here [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Villanueva+Mes%C3%ADa,+Granada/@37.2151472,-4.0149405,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd720a6c2e58005b:0x294cf30020a42b29!8m2!3d37.214584!4d-4.0112611].

I think that 28th would be perfect as it is not a labour day, and some of us, which don't live in Barcelona, could be easily there. If you are looking for maps of Barcelona, there's a zone very close to the Subway station of \"Arc de Triomf\", which is full of boardgame stores, some of them with bar, and playing zones.\n\nAs it happens to Dieter, I'm not quite good at speaking in English, but anyway it will be a great pleasure to meet you! Your blog is my reference page for this game, I've spent lots of hours reading you, and trying your decks!!! (I think that I left some comments there, a few years ago...)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301818-any-players-in-spain/?do=findComment&comment=3849796","commentId":3849796,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1576477159,"content":"@Dieter Van Hertz [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/326680-dieter-van-hertz/], I sent you a direct message with my contact details.
