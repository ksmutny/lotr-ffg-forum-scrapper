The only way of making them as an heroes is to use them like Bilbo is used in the Hobbit saga expansion. And even then it would be very difficult to balance them. (they shoud not produce resource tokens or they would not be additional heroes like Bilbo was) It allso means that they could not be used in any other scenario. Only in those where you exspesially allow them aka those Hobbit saga expansion scenarios for Bilbo.\n\nIf they are ally cards it would be easier to use them allso in many other scenarios allso! But ofcource it is your call. I IMHO like more ally variant, because they are more easily balanced because we have the Gandalf example of how making  a balanced but a powerfull card! Those two wizards got corrupted  like Radagast and Saruman did, so threat cost based actions are guite good idea! Just have to make that threat cost big enough! Only Gandalf remained true in the original quest of bringing the pease and harmony to the Middle Earth. Radagast was corrupted by narure, so he was/is only usefull when dealing with nature (so the creature only usefulnes is actually very good point by FFG!) He was somewhat completely unusefull in any other way! Same should be considered with Alatar and Pallando and allso the Saruman! They sould be only good in one very specifick task and somewhat completely unusefull in any other (to some extent) if you want to follow the spirit of the Lord of the Rings but maybe these are earlier incarnations of those \"fallen\" wizards and they are not yeat so corrupted that they can be more usefull in general, like Gandalf is/was.\n\nIn ICE the Pallando was corrupted by knowledge, and mystics (spells, artifatc, rituals, foreseeing). Alatar by the force of hunt (killing animals, beast, enemies of dark). Saruman was corrupted by knowlege of the ring and palantir (greed and fear and lust for power). Radagast was corrubted by the nature (consentration only to the wildlife: animals and plants).\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78587-the-blue-wizards-have-arrived/?do=findComment&comment=757827","commentId":757827,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1359833418,"content":"Well I see your point, but that was only Tolkien's first idea of them.  Later in his life he changed his opinion on them and instead said that without them, the enemies in the east and south would have so greatly outnumbered the people of the west that they wouldn't have stood a chance.  So that's why I made them good, because I'm going off his last revision of them.  \n\n\"Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of Men that had rebelled from Melkor-worship, to stir up rebellion … and after his first fall to search out his hiding (in which they failed) and to cause [?dissension and disarray] among the dark East … They must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age and Third Age in weakening and disarraying the forces of East … who would both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have … outnumbered the West.\" - J.R.R.

Maybe too deadly if it appears in first two turns (very low engagement cost)) I would make it a little bit bigger, so it would not hit you during the first turn… But nice little enemy indeed :-)\n\nEasterling chieftain: Would it be better if the bonus would go to the easterling enemies only? (a matter of taste) The real problem may be that when this one come to the staging area it will be engaged during the same turn it was released (there is not any rule in the card that would keep it in the staging area) so the +1 effect would never come in use, so it is somewhat empty card at this incarnation. Maybe: \"You can not engage Easterling chieftain, if there are other easterling minions in the game…\"\n\nEndles plain: this is pure pain… Very dangerous location, but maybe suited to location manipulation and heavy tactic decks. Have to play with it with spesific deck until I can say more, but dangerous location indeed!\n\nEasterling Ambush: A nice card that keeps those easterlings coming. Does not need any tweaking from my point of view…\n\nYou seems to focus on minion horde that just keep on coming from the very moment it is released from the enounter deck. These cards support that theme guite well. It allso means that bad start (no allies) will end the game very quicly. A player need a big party of allies to fight these. If he don't get them he will be overwhelmed very quicly. It is a good and a bad thing at the same time. A dwarf ally heavy deck can manage this, but not so many other deck type at this moment. Interesting to see how those new Gondor cards will do against this.

But, if you have 5 (not a decided number yet) locations in your victory display, then you've succesfully run away from the enemy without having to fight them. If you don't, then you'll have to fight all the enemies until their are none left in play. The second is harder, but there's a reward at the end of some treasure cards if you go this way…\n\nI'll try to post more cards later.  And maybe you'll see some player cards in there as well to help deal with the so numerous enemies…."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78587-the-blue-wizards-have-arrived/?do=findComment&comment=765406","commentId":765406,"userName":"Hannibal_pjv","timestamp":1361383468,"content":"Ok.
