I would recommend trying out LackeyCGG instead. There's a toturial there and it's not a pirate program as Octgn. While Octgn is a cool program they totally disregard FFG's rule about all cards being for sale for at least 6 months before porting them to any digital tabletop game simulators. Only program so forth respecting this is Lackey as it's up to the programmer of the individual plugins to respect FFG's wish. And the programmer for LotR do that :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68750-octgn-question/?do=findComment&comment=670307","commentId":670307,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1344388802,"content":" This might be what you are looking for:\n\n\n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68750-octgn-question/?do=findComment&comment=670358","commentId":670358,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1344399222,"content":"kevco11 said:\n\nDoes anyone have a tutorial for this system.
