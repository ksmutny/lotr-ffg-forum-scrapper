It brought my games to brutal onslaught since I was questing with almost everyone but threat in staging and of engaged enemies was too high so just raised my threat and my allies kept dying due to undefended attacks (later discovered it must go on heroes) and had no attack to strike back. I will never forgive Nate French for ignoring that part in the rules."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222740-treat-question/?do=findComment&comment=2271659","commentId":2271659,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1466192489,"content":"People often ask this question.  I wonder where the confusion arises?  The rules tell you to calculate the threat value of all cards \"in the staging area\" when questing and they also tell you that to engage an enemy you have to \"move the enemy from the staging area and place it in front of the engaging player.\"   So an engaged enemy would not be in the staging area.  If you move it \"from the staging area\" it would be out of the staging area...\n\n \n\nI suppose they should have directly said so."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222740-treat-question/?do=findComment&comment=2271830","commentId":2271830,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1466200621,"content":"> People often ask this question.  I wonder where the confusion arises?  The rules tell you to calculate the threat value of all cards \"in the staging area\" when questing and they also tell you that to engage an enemy you have to \"move the enemy from the staging area and place it in front of the engaging player.\"   So an engaged enemy would not be in the staging area.  If you move it \"from the staging area\" it would be out of the staging area...\n> \n>  \n> \n> I suppose they should have directly said so.\n\n \n\nI think it's just one of those things that gets overlooked when reading the rules.  And then they mistakenly just consider every enemy card on the board to be the \"staging area\" including both the active location and enemies engaged with you.   I agree the language is perfectly fine and clear, but they could have also directly said so.\n\n \n\nI do feel the majority of the time, this gets handled correctly but it does seem to be an area they could be clearer on.  It's on my wishlist for a re-mastered Core box set or Core-companion box set.  Though that will never happen."}]}
