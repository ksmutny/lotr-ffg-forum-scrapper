Dues to safty reasons you have to hold it longer to reset the state.\n\nDue to hardware limitations I tested the app only on my own mobile. Dunno how well it works on others. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Anyhow, feel free to give feedback.\n\nI do not know if this post violates any forum restictions. I do not want to harm anyone, just share this for free.\n\n----------------------------\n\nHey,\n\nbecause I was bored, I tried to build an android app. (I am new to the procedure of programming apps for mobile.) So far, I have a very simple one which tracks your threat and counts the rounds. Nothing special, but I thought maybe others want it, too. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] No adds and hopefully for free, of course!\n\nThis is where the real questions kick in. ?\n\nI used some LotR pictures (which are probably copyrighted) as well as some icon graphics (from OCTGN, I think). So I do wonder about any legal issues. Any ideas if this simple app can \"fly under the radar\" without getting me in trouble, when making it public? Whom to contact at FFG(?) or anywhere else?\n\nAlso, it seems to me that when publishing at the android play store I am forced to have a Developers Account, which is 25$ just for registration. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] WTF!? I want to give something for free here.... ?\n\nAny serious alternatives? Well, I could send the APK via mail...\n\nRegards,\n\nFlrbb\n\n \n\nEdited July 2, 2018 by Flrbb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3354102","commentId":3354102,"userName":"TacticsLandroval","timestamp":1527684896,"content":"You could remove all the copyrighted material and publish on fdroid.\n\n \n\nThere are already some mtg apps on there."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3354116","commentId":3354116,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1527685510,"content":"If FFG let octgn live, they probably won't mind an app as long as you're not making profit on it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3358815","commentId":3358815,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1528012376,"content":"Updated the first post with a link to the app."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3369362","commentId":3369362,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1528700486,"content":"Uptdate to v1.3\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3372694","commentId":3372694,"userName":"LoPocket","timestamp":1528918763,"content":"Any chance of this coming to iOS?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3373303","commentId":3373303,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1528963728,"content":"> 12 hours ago, LoPocket said:\n> \n> Any chance of this coming to iOS?\n\nNot from me. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3382095","commentId":3382095,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1529686302,"content":"Edited the first post: now there is v1.4 available."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3382833","commentId":3382833,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1529740651,"content":"v1.41:\n\nadded the questes from Wilds of Rhovanion "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3391963","commentId":3391963,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1530551954,"content":"v1.44\n\n * added some more icons\n * extended the staging thread calulator drop down from 40 to 50"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3392279","commentId":3392279,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1530567600,"content":"@Flrbb [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/245439-flrbb/] Is this on the apple appstore?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276885-threat-tracker-app-for-android-now-with-link-d/?do=findComment&comment=3392686","commentId":3392686,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1530603607,"content":"No, it is not.
