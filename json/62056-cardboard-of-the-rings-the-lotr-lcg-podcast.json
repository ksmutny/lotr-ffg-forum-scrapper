They are far more knowledgeable about this game than myself. I think, going into this, my role was always somewhat of the perspective from someone who doesn't understand card games as well. The interactions I've seen all four of the other guys come up with is incredible. Mitch is a master of building synergistic decks, Andrew comes up with card combos I've never even remotely thought of, and Brandon somehow manages to make cards I thought were garbage look like cards made of solid gold. Jared, of course, does all of that and then multiplies our skills by 20 or so. I like to think that what I bring to the show is, like I said, the perspective of someone who is learning all of this as he goes, plus I'm big into the actual lore of the story, so I like to really look at the flavor of the cards.\n\nAs for the missing cat, we haven't heard her in awhile! Mitch and I have animals running around the house that I usually try to edit out of the recording because they're more annoying in the recording than they are cute. I'll make sure Brandon knows that the fans are missing the sixth co-host."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62056-cardboard-of-the-rings-the-lotr-lcg-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=609211","commentId":609211,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1332459118,"content":"Some Cardboard of the Rings trivia: the cat you occasionally hear when Mitch is speaking is Fenri [http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/8365/img0123ar.jpg]s [http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/8365/img0123ar.jpg], whom would be the kitten you hear during Episode 22.\n\nNow, if he would only hunt and eat that little barking dog..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62056-cardboard-of-the-rings-the-lotr-lcg-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=609988","commentId":609988,"userName":"xibxang","timestamp":1332689031,"content":"I've been a fan since I first discovered it a couple months ago.

We're so afraid of criticism and someone letting us know that we made a mistake that we delete the comments. We are scared!\n\nSarcasm aside, we welcome the criticism. I really do mean that. None of us claim to be perfect at this game, and none of us has claimed that we are the end-all experts on its rules and playability.\n\nWhat I do despise is your antagonistic approach to the situation. The two of you have a notorious ability to make people feel pretty sh*tty with your comments. Rather than using your -- and it pains me to admit this -- pretty impressive knowledge of how this game functions to help people develop their strategies in a friendly way, you attack and insult. Your stupid little disclaimer comments in your signature doesn't mean you aren't being a ****, you're just making an excuse for yourself.\n\nI personally don't know what Glaurung's comment was on YouTube, and it wasn't me who deleted it. I can't speak to it, but based on every interaction I've had on here, I have no doubt that it was a nasty comment designed only to hurt, not designed to provide constructive feedback for us. And frankly that's good enough for a reason to delete it. I welcome both of you to continue listening to the show and watching our videos if you want, but don't expect us to accept your feedback in the same manner that we accept it from others. We don't owe you anything, and coming at us with the attitude that both of you use just causes us to act out of anger. So congratulations, I guess you got what you wanted. You've managed to piss us off! I guess you win!\n\nTo the rest of the community, and those of you who take a look at the videos, please don't let anything I've said here discourage you from letting us know when we make a mistake. Yes, sometimes we miss text on a card, but I assure you it is a mistake likely prompted by our desire to produce a quick, clean playthrough and video for you, and not an intentional decision to try and cheat. Mistakes will continue to be made -- several times we've reversed decisions we made on cards because we read them incorrectly, I myself do this all the time!\n\nPlease continue to let us know if we goof up. We want to play these scenarios correctly. And as a final message, I don't want anyone to think that we have tried to elevate ourselves to some sort of godlike status. We just make a podcast and some videos. I firmly believe there are people on this site and others who have more knowledge about this game than the five of us. It's entertainment; we're not absolute experts and we're not the final word on anything that happens with this game. All right, that's enough feeding the trolls.\n\nHappy gaming!

I'm glad I didn't, but as soon as I had deleted your comments out of irritation, I wished I hadn't - once my initial reaction subsided, I would have much rather written something like I have now, so in that way, thank you for coming to this thread and giving me a second chance to express myself in response to still more snarky, antagonistic comments.\n\nYou say that criticism makes people better players, and most of the time, I would agree with you; the problem, however, is that you are not a constructive critic. Leaving a comment that says \"can you even read???\" is not constructive, nor does it make anyone a better player. It's nothing more than a thinly veiled personal attack directed toward me or the countless other individuals and forum posters that you have directed your \"criticism\" toward. Your other comment, mentioning that I did in fact overlook the \"response\" ability on quest card 2B (I mis-read it as Forced), was actually constructive - I had made an assumption, and stand corrected. However, when you and Booored suggest that the people responsible for producing this podcast and the videos don't \"understand how to play the game,\" purely because of simple mistakes like this, that just comes off as malicious and ignorant, and generates ire toward the both of you.\n\nHave you ever stopped to think that maybe it would make for a boring video or podcast if there were frequent or long pauses to process every possible piece of information, or to read every single card verbatim? Have you ever stopped to think that some of us don't want to dedicate the amount of time and effort necessary to ensure that everything is perfect? I have not committed every single card in the game to memory, and there are plenty of scenarios I haven't played for months - deal with it. Neither the podcast or the videos are scripted or rehearsed (nor will they be), and therefore, mistakes happen. I would love for either of you to release a recording of one of your own gameplay sessions, or to put out your own podcast, just so you might begin to understand that they are different than posting on a forum - you cannot easily edit your content. If we mispeak on the podcast, or don't take the time to look up a rule, it's in the interest of keeping the running time within reason (the podcast already tends to run two hours long), and it's more important to us that we create interesting and engaging material (your mileage may vary), than to get everything perfect; plus, not every co-host has as much time to dedicate every other week.\n\nIf we get a rule wrong, it isn't because I, or any other co-host has some sort of mental deficiency, and it isn't because I, or any other co-host, doesn't \"understand how to play the game.\" Mistakes happen. Criticism is helpful, and welcome, but the garbage that you and Booored consistently, incessantly post in this forum is rarely constructive, especially so far as anything related to COTR is concerned. As much as I appreciate every single person that listens to our podcast and/or watches our videos, I would welcome the opportunity to never have to read so much as a single additional post from either of you two.\n\nBy the way: all of this was written in haste, so you'll have to excuse me if I made any mistakes.\n\n- Mitch"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62056-cardboard-of-the-rings-the-lotr-lcg-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=661263","commentId":661263,"userName":"ichaos1985","timestamp":1342756034,"content":"TheLightdarker said:\n\n[…] If we mispeak on the podcast, or don't take the time to look up a rule, it's in the interest of keeping the running time within reason (the podcast already tends to run two hours long), and it's more important to us that we create interesting and engaging material (your mileage may vary), than to get everything perfect; plus, not every co-host has as much time to dedicate every other week.[…]\n\n- Mitch\n\nWhat was that…. \".. then he gets off and your hosed\" ? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]:D I had a really good laugh there. \n\nI really enjoy your podcast and the insight you give for all those cards. To err is human, to forgive is divine.

Well done, all LOTR LCG fans greatly appreciate your time and effort spent on all that you guys do. Cheers.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlad to hear that you've enjoyed them, and thank you very much for the feedback! I've been away from the video production scene (and my LOTR LCG playing has dropped off considerably), since a few months ago - details to come in Episode 38, which should be live sometime soon - but in the meantime, it's great to be back, and the new series has been a blast to make, so far. As soon as Matthew gets back in town from out of state, we'll be churning out many, many more!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62056-cardboard-of-the-rings-the-lotr-lcg-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=741133","commentId":741133,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1356968341,"content":"Just in time for the new year, Episode 38 has arrived!
