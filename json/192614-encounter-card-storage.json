Prepared player decks are in deck boxes, with their set of heroes. Then I have bags of unsorted encounter cards waiting to be sleeved (completely ran out of decent sleeves at the ULGS).\n\n \n\nI'm in the process of designing some encounter tuck boxes, which I will continue to store in those long boxes (until I can be bothered to make cycle boxes, like Gizlivadi's). I want one tuck box for each encounter symbol, sized for sleeved cards of variable counts, and identifiable from all angles. Maybe I'll also print up some custom sphere stickers for use with player deck boxes.\n\n \n\nSome of this relies on Staples actually having label sheets in stock, but I've found 200gsm paper to be decent enough for tuck boxes. If printed and treated with acrylic varnish they are about the right thickness, although I'm going to experiment with photo paper too. It's not like it's possible to make anything flimsier than the cheapest plastic Ultra-Pro deck boxes :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192614-encounter-card-storage/?do=findComment&comment=1880332","commentId":1880332,"userName":"Zalrus9","timestamp":1446743810,"content":"I have a giant 4000 card white cardboard box that I keep all of my encounter cards, unsleeved, with white plastic dividers.
