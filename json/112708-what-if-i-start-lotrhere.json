Perhaps as iznax said this game isn't for you, but I'd say give it another shot on easy mode. How many of you have actually played Heirs solo and on easy mode?? A lot of the difficulty is taken away with easy and solo.\n\n \n\nGetting the Hobbit sagas is a terrible idea, those quests are mostly broken with random riddle effects, super tough trolls or the poison- I think these quests are more difficult than the Heirs quests! The Black Riders however has some solid Hobbit cards and has a good narrative feel especially if you play Campaign mode (but then you'll need future Saga boxes).\n\n \n\nDo you all forget that he will be playing on Easy mode?? Even though this doesn't take all the difficulty away it certainly helps and he can also house rule if he's really getting smashed still.\n\n \n\nIf you really want this game for the narrative then obviously the newest cycles are the best option, you clearly said you don't want to revisit the early cycles you've already played so people need to stop suggesting that.\n\n \n\nHe is playing solo which is best for the Against the Shadow Cycle- multiplayer is what gets really difficult as the encounter deck synergizes really well but can't do that in solo play.\n\n \n\nIn general I have really enjoyed the Voice of Isengard and the Ringmaker cycle so I would definitely suggest getting that but the player cards aren't very good so I would not start with this cycle even though the quests are amazing.\n\n \n\nHeirs of Numenor and it's Against the Shadow cycle hooks you up with Outlands which are super powerful and easy to build; Beregond, Defender of Rammas and Gondorian Shield which give you amazing defending options so you can survive some of these difficult quests; and all the traps which are fun to play and powerful. So if you buy this whole cycle you will have good player cards to play with but still challenging quests.\n\n \n\nThe first two quests in the Against the Shadow are kind of annoying in that you need to build certain decks but otherwise these quests are just decent, the narrative definitely helps them be more enjoyable but I do really like other quests from other cycles better but you may enjoy these more if the narrative is that big of a factor.\n\n \n\nSo overall, Heirs and the Against the Shadow has difficult quests, sometimes not the most fun but the narrative is really cool. The player cards from all of this are pretty good especially for Outlands and Tactics defense stuff. So if you play for the narrative, on solo and easy mode you should be good. You can listen to whoever you want but I'd say definitely go for it!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited August 8, 2014 by Catastrophic09"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112708-what-if-i-start-lotrhere/?do=findComment&comment=1190336","commentId":1190336,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1407552146,"content":"So, the take-home message of this thread is that no one can **** agree which quests are hard."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112708-what-if-i-start-lotrhere/?do=findComment&comment=1190425","commentId":1190425,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1407556261,"content":"Go not to the FFG forums for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.\n\nEdited August 9, 2014 by Raven1015"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112708-what-if-i-start-lotrhere/?do=findComment&comment=1190878","commentId":1190878,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1407596683,"content":"> Go not to the FFG forums for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.\n\nWhere should he go for counsel?  This is where I would have asked....  I think he got some good answers and making his decision will be a lot easier now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112708-what-if-i-start-lotrhere/?do=findComment&comment=1191239","commentId":1191239,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1407616342,"content":"> > Go not [/size]to the FFG forums[/size] for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.[/size]\n> \n> Where should he go for counsel?  This is where I would have asked....  I think he got some good answers and making his decision will be a lot easier now.\n\nThis is where to go but Raven1015 was making a joke referring to when Frodo was talking to Gildor about the counsel of elves.... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nAnd yes he has now heard many opinions and can hopefully make a better decision when and if to jump back into this game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112708-what-if-i-start-lotrhere/?do=findComment&comment=1193800","commentId":1193800,"userName":"GalaxyUC","timestamp":1407777416,"content":"Thanks for the tip everyone.
