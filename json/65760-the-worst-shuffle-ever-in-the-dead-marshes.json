I lost Gollem in the fourth turn or so and re-shuffled him back into the deck. \n\nI was playing a solo game with my my Rohan based mono-spirit deck, so I managed to keep my threat down while trying to whittle away the deck to find him again. By the end I had about my entire deck of allies in play, had used all my Gandalfs just to lower my threat, and was waiting for a Dwarven tomb to get a Greeting card back.\n\nI hit 50 threat with 5 cards left in the encounter deck. Gollem was on the very bottom… Dwarven tomb was the next card in my deck…."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65760-the-worst-shuffle-ever-in-the-dead-marshes/?do=findComment&comment=642499","commentId":642499,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1339307111,"content":"To avoid this kind of problem play with house rule: when Gollum get 8 tokens he escape and you lose a game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65760-the-worst-shuffle-ever-in-the-dead-marshes/?do=findComment&comment=642541","commentId":642541,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1339319027,"content":"Haha, Glaurung!

Seeing 10 cards left in the encounter deck and knowing that the Gollum card had to be next. I am glad I kept playing!\n\nOne drink per token huh? My wife might be pretty curious about why I was passed out on the floor in the morning!\n\n "}]}
