Since the first adventure pack new player cards come in threes but looking at the core set you're missing quite a few cards. So I would really like to see an upgrade pack for the core set to get the missing player cards because it's quite inconvenient to buy multiple core sets as you'll have so many unnecessary cards then.\n\nSo what do you guys think about it? Did you already buy multiple core sets or would you like to see such an upgrade pack? Or are you just sticking with the core set and don't see the need for having all cards three times?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60267-upgrade-pack-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=592462","commentId":592462,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1328840231,"content":" It's been discussed several times before.\n\n \n\nGeneral consensus seems to be \"It'd be nice, but it's never going to happen\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60267-upgrade-pack-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=592490","commentId":592490,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1328847885,"content":"I only have one Core Set, and I have no desire to purchase additional boxes.

A fixed set of cards - you know exactly what you are buying unlike other games that sell their product randomly in booster packs. AGoT and CoC used to be sold this way. FFG decided they could survive the CCG glut and continue to produce cards for their fans by switching to this method. If it weren't for this switch, those games probably would not be here today.\n\n \n\nIf WotC decided to sell Magic in sets that included 1 of every card for $40, I think people would be lined up to buy 4 sets upon every release, including all those people you know.\n\n \n\nI probably would."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60267-upgrade-pack-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=595718","commentId":595718,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1329563459,"content":" Both of those are also fairly old posts - and I have taken the time to read them yes.\n\nAt the time they were posted though - there wasn't much support at all for this game.

The real rub comes when the 3rd core set purchase is only for about 20 cards.\n\n \n\nEdit: Didn't see your post Mkultra.\n\nPeople that want to play magic competitively don't buy boosters to get their missing cards (at least when they learn better) .\n\nThe main thing magic has going for it in that regard though is the sale of singles - because you can work out the cards you want and buy them individually.\n\nTypically people would buy a box of boosters - sort what they had; sell the excess and buy the missing cards to complete their deck or decks.\n\nThere's no real sale on singles in the LCG model - because everyone knows what they're getting and the excess cards are therefore just going to be wasted.\n\nThe scale of cards in a magic release compared to a lord of the rings release would mean that a complete set would cost you more - but a comparative number of cards (but full play sets of them) doesn't - at least at the UK prices it doesn't.\n\n \n\nAs to your point that they never claimed that one core set was enough - you're right. I'm not arguing that they should or might want to consider changing it because I feel cheated; I knew in advance of buying what to expect and after careful consideration decided it was worth investing in this game to try it anyway. So there's not a sense of entitlement here.\n\nIt's a question of changing the design of the core set to meet with the direction that they're taking the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60267-upgrade-pack-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=595767","commentId":595767,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1329580295,"content":"Remember, we aren't talking about the distribution line fore a single product, we are talking about the distribution for all the LCG product lines.  As such, I don't think anything has changed in the past nine months since Christians last posts that would indicate that they need to alter the distribution models.  The fact that the consumers of the LotR chapter packs have bought into the product and are effectively 'hooked' isn't a reason to switch.  In fact, quite the opposite.  If they are hooked they are MORE likely to buy multiple packs.\n\nAs for magic and the singles market, its hard to even compare costs to an LCG.  In most releases, getting your hands on a play set of just a single chase-card will cost you more than three boxes of core. Putting together a single tournament caliber deck can often run you more then core + every expansion to LotR thus far."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60267-upgrade-pack-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=598574","commentId":598574,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1330134632,"content":"Not that I wish to perpetuate this discussion any longer than entirely necessary, but:\n\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2243 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2243]\n\nI direct you all to comment #8 at the bottom of the page gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60267-upgrade-pack-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=598615","commentId":598615,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1330155077,"content":"spalanzani said:\n\n \n\nNot that I wish to perpetuate this discussion any longer than entirely necessary, but:\n\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2243 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2243]\n\nI direct you all to comment #8 at the bottom of the page gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ngood catch\n\nnail=in coffin"}]}
