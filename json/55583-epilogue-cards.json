In addition to the satisfaction of succeeding at a Quest, I REALLY wish there was something more afterwards, maybe just a little more than...you win! I'm not sure if I'm in the minority here. I believe there are more people who play this game strictly for the card game, win or lose mechanic the competition, as opposed to a neat on going storyline.\n\nOn the flip side of things, I'm sure the primary counter to my desire for somekind of ending to each quest is, well, the epilogue of the quest you just played, is the beginning of the next quest. Would you guys agree?\n\nOr, are there other like me who think it woldn't hurt to maybe just one more card to the quest deck, or a short paragraph to read after the quest, like there is a short one during set up? I love the fluff...guilty.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55583-epilogue-cards/?do=findComment&comment=549761","commentId":549761,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1320070681,"content":"To be honest, I've never even thought about it.

Your epilogue is this. Did you get that victory point from this X card? Then go to this webpage and read your epilogue."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55583-epilogue-cards/?do=findComment&comment=549959","commentId":549959,"userName":"mason240","timestamp":1320098618,"content":" That would be another advantage of an online CCG. Players could unlock cards by beating scenarios. I would certianly add to the storytelling aspect of the game. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55583-epilogue-cards/?do=findComment&comment=549992","commentId":549992,"userName":"Will Fuqua","timestamp":1320104785,"content":" I like the idea of bringing in more story to the game and having the end of a scenario feel more final by having flavor text describe what was accomplished.  At the very least have more story put into the included sheet that has the info for on the quest.  I mean this is "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55583-epilogue-cards/?do=findComment&comment=549994","commentId":549994,"userName":"Will Fuqua","timestamp":1320105255,"content":"Sorry, my iPad went weird on me.  Anyway, what I was going to say is the game is based on novels that are renowned for having very rich characters and deep story.   The game isn't based off some hack and slash story. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55583-epilogue-cards/?do=findComment&comment=550035","commentId":550035,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1320121534,"content":" it's a nice idea - Ninjadorg's custom scenario's have prologue and epilogue cards.\n\nI guess the main issue, as someone said, is that it would be another card used up out of the pack.

For example, a victory mechanic for Journey to Rhosgobel could be that you keep Wilydor as an ally in your next scenario (but with three health)."}]}
