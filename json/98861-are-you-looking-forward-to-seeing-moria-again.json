I think i would have even preferred it if we had more than one quest. Its going to be pretty difficult for them to cram everything into a single quest — i wonder how they're going to do it.\n\nIt will probably be split up into stages, first of all a big mass fight at balins tomb, then a mad dash through to the bridge, and then we're going to have to have a big fight at the end with the balrog. I reckon they will have gandalf as an objective card, and we will have to keep him alive until the final stage so he can dispatch the balrog. We might be able to sacrifice him to take the balrog out, then it will just be a battle against normal enemies to get out the gate\n\nEdited February 9, 2014 by Cunir"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98861-are-you-looking-forward-to-seeing-moria-again/?do=findComment&comment=979357","commentId":979357,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1391961786,"content":"I am."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98861-are-you-looking-forward-to-seeing-moria-again/?do=findComment&comment=979391","commentId":979391,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1391964250,"content":"The quests in Moria are some of my favourites of the game so far.
