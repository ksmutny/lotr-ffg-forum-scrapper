Nothing seems to say no. You would have a hero that you will be forced to threat up by 2 each round, but he will be a 4, 4, 4, 4 hero (as opposed to his 3, 3, 3, 5 hero) that doesn’t exhaust to quest, and can play a card face up. In a grey wanderer, low threat deck that is already using him as an ally, that would make him that much cooler for only 3 extra resources. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309568-thorongil/?do=findComment&comment=3961329","commentId":3961329,"userName":"bdavis969","timestamp":1594685893,"content":"Would Wild Stallion still apply once you make him a hero?

Still if you have the money and deck space it can surely be quite fun to pull off."}]}
