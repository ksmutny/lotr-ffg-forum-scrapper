Indeed, it is worth noting that to get the card in the victory display you have to defeat/explore it, not just discard it, so even if you used an effect that said \"discard an enemy\" on a Victory Points enemy that was in play, you'd still not get it into the victory display."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277558-shadow-card-with-victory-points/?do=findComment&comment=3368713","commentId":3368713,"userName":"bitzurock","timestamp":1528644041,"content":"Thank you!"}]}
