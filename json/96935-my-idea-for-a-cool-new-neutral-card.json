I think a \"Mercenary\" ally would be really cool. It could be called something like \"Northern Mercenary\" or whatever  -basically just a hired sword. It would fit into almost any deck since it's neutral and could belong in any themed deck since it would just be a hired mercenary for our quest, meaning the race or faction wouldn't matter for most decks.\n\n \n\nTo reflect the characters poor loyalty (since it's just a hired sword) it could have a forced effect similar to Silvan Refugee for example:\n\n \n\nForced: If a character you control leaves play discard Northern Mercenary.\n\n \n\nIf battle starts to go ill these guys aren't going to be sticking around for long. I think this card is a pretty cool idea, at least i would love to see more neutral ally cards in the future. What do you guys think? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited January 16, 2014 by Djenni"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96935-my-idea-for-a-cool-new-neutral-card/?do=findComment&comment=955354","commentId":955354,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1389826937,"content":"What were you thinking for the stats?
