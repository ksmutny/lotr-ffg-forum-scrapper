As for focus - for you this art focuses on dwarf, for me it focuses on what the dwarf is doing. It's the matter of prespective. And I disagree with you about Haldir.

There's a reason professional illustrators actually study stuff and have a series of rules for composition and illustration. A piece like the one I revealed last time, for example, will most likely not end up as a character card, considering that its focus is not really just on Glorfindel, but on the Nazgul getting swept away and the whole situation the image is depicting, hence the assumption it will be an event (not to mention its title). Haldir, as you said, is really doing very little on the art, rather just \"looking cool\". The art is clearly just meant to focus on the character posing. This is a very similar piece of art. Sure, he's putting on a helmet so you could assume it will be a helmet attachment, but then again, Erkenbrand is charging forward on his horse and the art ended up in a hero card, not a mount attachment or an event. Both arts still have one main element, that is, the character. And finally, it really doesn't matter in this case if Magali drew Glorfindel in a number of pieces and called them Glorfindel. That's her. Giacobino, on the other hand, always tends to post his hero art before release and title it as the character that's depicted. It happened with Haldir, Mablung and Aragorn. Those arts were all called by those names and ended up being heroes, so considering the antecedents of this particular artist, this will most likely be the art for a hero card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182133-yet-another-leaked-piece-of-art/?do=findComment&comment=1687202","commentId":1687202,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1436469195,"content":"There is absolutely no way we can know either way at this point, so let's just wait and see.

A defensive tactics hero in a dwarf deck would be very powerful even in solo if you're going with the optimal leadership heroes, Dain and Thorin. Thorin quests and/or attacks while Dori defends. That could be very powerful with all the resource acceleration and attachments like Ring-mail, events like Foe Hammer with all the axes, Erebor Battle Master, etc. But the thing is that in solo the other tactics Dwarf heroes are either risky with the high starting threat (Gimli) or are totally useless in the current meta (Thalin).
