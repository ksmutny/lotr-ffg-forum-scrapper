As a new player it's not very intuitive, but the only time you definitely need a hero with the correct resource icon is when you want to play a 0-cost card. When I was new, I thought 0-cost cards could be played by any hero. Then I thought A Good Harvest and Elrond could pay for 0-cost cards (note: you can't, because it says you can spend resources for it and you're not spending anything). So if you want to play e.g. a 0-cost event like Close Call, you need a hero with a Tactics resource icon.\n\n \n\nedit: Narvi's Belt should work, though, as it gives you a new resource icon and not just the option to spend resources in another sphere.

Quick Strike basically allows you to trigger the \"Declare attacks against enemies\" step with a single character during any action window. Because the event is merely triggering a normal framework step, it can be used against enemies that are immune to player card effects. Although the wording looks similar, Hands Upon the Bow actually functions differently. It is an effect which allows an attack to be declared against an enemy in the staging area, but it grants this ability because normally characters cannot declare attacks against enemies in the staging area. Because this granted effect is beyond the basic framework step of declaring attacks, this card does not work against enemies that are immune to player card effects. This is not intuitive, but when you think about Quick Strike just being a short-circuit of an existing game mechanic whereas Hands Upon the Bow grants a special ability (staging area attack), it makes a bit more sense. The fact that this surprises people (it definitely surprised me when I asked Caleb about it originally) is why I chose it as an example of a confusing rule."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178134-which-is-the-most-hard-rule-to-understand-it/?do=findComment&comment=1636721","commentId":1636721,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1432667496,"content":"It still sits odd with me, since Quick Strike lets you declare attacks during Planning, Quest phase, anytime.  That's certainly outside of the typical \"framework\" of effects.  So yeah, immunity is hard."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178134-which-is-the-most-hard-rule-to-understand-it/?do=findComment&comment=1636961","commentId":1636961,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1432675476,"content":"I have never really struggled with immunity questions.
