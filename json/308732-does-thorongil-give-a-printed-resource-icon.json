That's why I think the omission of \"printed\" is intentional."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308732-does-thorongil-give-a-printed-resource-icon/?do=findComment&comment=3945159","commentId":3945159,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1590610037,"content":"According to the strict reading of the rules, it would not. But according to the strict reading of the rules, the entire effect does nothing because it fails to the uniqueness rule. So it is a difficult card to interpret. I would not count it as being a printed icon. As small compensation, this interpretation protects the added game text from \"treat each character's text box as if it were blank\" effects."}]}
