I'm fairly certain I know the answer, but I'm just hoping for some outside input on a question that's been troubling me. Say I'm attacked by an enemy, and utilize a character such as West Road Traveler to defend, who has a defense stat of 0. Is the act of declaring her a defender considered defending, despite no damage reduction occuring? Or is the attack considered undefended? I would think the act would count as defending, but I'm not sure and can't seem to find any rulings on it. There have been a few shadow cards where the outcome of my game may have been different with an undefended attack as opposed to a defended one. Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61022-defending-with-an-ally-with-a-defense-stat-of-0/?do=findComment&comment=598764","commentId":598764,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1330191650,"content":"Even if the defense stat is 0 it counts as a defended attack.  For instance, the next best use for a Snowbourne Scout after it enters play is to block an attack and die for the cause!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61022-defending-with-an-ally-with-a-defense-stat-of-0/?do=findComment&comment=598769","commentId":598769,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1330192461,"content":"Awesome, that's what I figured, just wanted to be sure. There's only been a handful of times where the shadow card would have made it a win/lose situation based off of that, but it gnaws at me not knowing if I'm playing by the rules, lol.
