It is most likely best played in a multi-player environment where you have at least one other player playing a more Quest/Support centric deck.\n\nI am also thinking of replacing either a Citadel Plate/Steward of Gondor or the Common Cause x2  with more copies of Celebrian's Stone to help in Questing better.\n\n \n\nHeroes:\n\nAragorn, Gimli, Legolas\n\nAllies:\n\nHorseback Archer x3 (T)\n\nGondorian Spearman x3 (T)\n\nSnowborn Scout x3 (L)\n\nSilverlode Archer x2 (L)\n\nGandalf x3 (N)\n\n \n\nEvents:\n\nRain of Arrows x3 (T)\n\nSwift Strike x3 (T)\n\nBlade Mastery x3 (T)\n\nFeint x3 (T)\n\nQuick Strike x3 (T)\n\nCommon Cause x2 (L)\n\nSneak Attack x3 (L)\n\nValiant Sacrifice x3 (L)\n\n \n\nAttachments:\n\nCelebrian's Stone x1 (L)\n\nSteward of Gondor x3 (L)\n\nCitadel Plate x3 (T)\n\nHorn of Gondor x3 (T)\n\nBlade of Gondolin x3 (T)\n\n \n\nAll comments are welcome and if necessary I can also give a bit of a breakdown of the deck idea."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45712-first-deck-the-three-hunters/?do=findComment&comment=458471","commentId":458471,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1303659756,"content":" Celebrian's Stone is a 2x at least. 3x if you decide to go crazy and splash in a couple of Spirit cards, which might prove awesome. *cough Unexpected Courage cough* The Favor of the Lady,  a couple different event cards.\nHorn of Gondor can probably be a 2x at most.  I'd stick with 1x. \n\nYou have a lot of Restricted attachments. Keep in mind the cap of 2. Those Citadel Plates don't come cheap, even if you had 3 tactics heroes. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45712-first-deck-the-three-hunters/?do=findComment&comment=458475","commentId":458475,"userName":"Hastur360","timestamp":1303660335,"content":"Well I think have multiple copies, especially in a 50 card deck definitely increase the odds of me finding those cards. Though I do agree that Celebrian's Stone needs to move up to 2 copies. Maybe three and as you coughed out, Unexpected Courage may need to find a couple copies in the deck. So possibly the removal of a Horn of Gondor and one Citadel Plate for 2 more Celebrian's Stone, and the removal of Common Cause x2 for the Unexpected Courage x2.\n\n \n\nNo worries on the amount of restricted cards since a character can have at least 2 on. Also when in conjuction with a deck that plays Eowyn they become great pitch cards once I already have one out, or if another player beats me to putting it out first.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45712-first-deck-the-three-hunters/?do=findComment&comment=461519","commentId":461519,"userName":"Kitsune Rei","timestamp":1304179500,"content":"I like that those 3 heroes seem to work well together :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I know solo can be different, but it really makes a game run much smoother if someone is playing Eowyn, so generally I don't worry about having too many unique or restricted cards- they're great to make sure you get out, and if you don't need them they're great throwaways for Eowyn, or even some bad effects can make you discard I believe."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45712-first-deck-the-three-hunters/?do=findComment&comment=461891","commentId":461891,"userName":"sputang","timestamp":1304260373,"content":"I tried to make a deck like this but scrapped it after I kept getting hammered by the Hill Troll right away on the second scenario.  Those three heroes total  32 threat I think, which is too high to start for my liking.  But the theme is pretty cool. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45712-first-deck-the-three-hunters/?do=findComment&comment=461909","commentId":461909,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1304262262,"content":"sputang said:\n\nI tried to make a deck like this but scrapped it after I kept getting hammered by the Hill Troll right away on the second scenario.  Those three heroes total  32 threat I think, which is too high to start for my liking.  But the theme is pretty cool. \n\n\n\n \n\nExactly!

I was not attacking your play with the deck in the slightest. Just stating what I built the deck for and without good draws I still don't think on average you will have a lot of success with this deck. I am happy you are having success with it and it makes me think I will take it for more spins solo to see if I can achieve the same success. I am sure you are using a different deck design though with the three heroes and would be interested on your solo version of the deck if you don't mind posting it Conykchameleon."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45712-first-deck-the-three-hunters/?do=findComment&comment=462053","commentId":462053,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1304284839,"content":"Deck List - Tactics/Leadership: Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn\n\n \n\nHeroes\n\nLegolas\n\nGimli Aragorn\n\n \n\nAllies\n\nGuard of the Citadel 3x\n\nHorseback Archer 3x\n\nVeteran Axehand 3x\n\nGondorian Spearman 3x\n\nLongbeard Orcslayer 2x\n\nGandalf 3x\n\nFaramir 3x\n\n \n\nEvents\n\nFeint 3x\n\nStand Together 2x\n\nThe Galadhrim's Greeting 3x\n\nQuick Strike 3x\n\nSneak Attack 3x\n\nGrim Resolve 2x\n\nBlade Mastery 3x\n\n \n\nAttachments\n\nCitadel Plate 3x\n\nSteward of Gondor 3x\n\nCelebrian's Stone 2x (Wish I had a third)\n\nBlade of Gondolin 3x\n\n \n\nUsually I'm looking for Citadel Plate, Steward of Gondor, or Celebrian's Stone in my starting hand based on the scenario."}]}
