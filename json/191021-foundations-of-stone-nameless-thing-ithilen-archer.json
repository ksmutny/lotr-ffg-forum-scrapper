I put them in the deck because the Moria bats can only be targeted by ranged characters. I also have Ent allies which are quite strong and more suited to the Nameless Thing. So, yes, for now I will keep them in the deck but avoid this situation when it arises."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191021-foundations-of-stone-nameless-thing-ithilen-archer/?do=findComment&comment=1846042","commentId":1846042,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1444728028,"content":"Or make a deck that only consist of 0 or X cost cards... just to show those nameless things what´s what ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191021-foundations-of-stone-nameless-thing-ithilen-archer/?do=findComment&comment=1846176","commentId":1846176,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1444737815,"content":"Or make a trap deck and have the Nameless Things attach traps to themselves."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191021-foundations-of-stone-nameless-thing-ithilen-archer/?do=findComment&comment=1846206","commentId":1846206,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1444739617,"content":"Q: If a card is attached to Nameless Thing (D 125) as part of the resolution of its Forced effect, is that card’s game text active?\n\nA: No. Cards that are attached to Nameless Thing (or Elder Nameless Thing) as a result of triggering its Forced effect are considered attachments with no card title or game text.
