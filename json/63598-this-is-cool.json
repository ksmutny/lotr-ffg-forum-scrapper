All the more reason to sleeve the Encounter cards as well as the player cards…real top notch art ! And this nomination is highly deserved…ever since my girlfriend gave me this game, it not only made me an avid player of the game, but made me fall back in love all over again with Tolkien's work. In fact, the use they make of the whole setting, geography and history is simply awesome. Good work FFG !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63598-this-is-cool/?do=findComment&comment=622608","commentId":622608,"userName":"divinityofnumber","timestamp":1335513291,"content":" I agree! I love this LCG. I tend to be really competitive when it comes to card games, and this is a nice way to get together with friends and play cards, without the feeling of their being a winner and a loser; even when we lose, the game is fun and exciting. I enjoy the difficult quests, actually. Getting really close but not quite making it is intense, and makes me want to shuffle-up and try again!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63598-this-is-cool/?do=findComment&comment=622855","commentId":622855,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1335539052,"content":"divinityofnumber said:\n\n I agree!
