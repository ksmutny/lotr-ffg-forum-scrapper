The players' decision to answer the riddle or resolve the card normally surely must happen before the card resolves normally.

I kept running into the issue of running out of cards in my deck quickly, so the more riddles I could answer up front, the better. But suppose you don't want to take on two riddles... that's fine, just do the one.\n\nOf course, as I am writing this, I am worried about the fact that there's optionality in favor of the players. Treacheries don't usually behave that way. But it does seem to \"reward\" you for getting things right on the first riddle... first, encounter card discarding, and second, another riddle, if you're after that.\n\nEdited January 29, 2019 by player3351457"}]}
