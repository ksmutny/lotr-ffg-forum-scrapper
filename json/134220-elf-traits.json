This got me thinking about traits.\n\nIf we do see a Cirdan hero (it fits the area, and would be a reason to give us Narya), will he have the Sindar trait? Legolas and Celeborn are traited Silvan, which has always bugged me a little. I would rather they made Cirdan a Noldo than Silvan - I'm finding it hard to believe they're creating a new elf trait for him at this point. I realise you can't have too many traits floating around. Has Matt, Caleb or someone else ever addressed this?\n\nEdited February 6, 2015 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134220-elf-traits/?do=findComment&comment=1438440","commentId":1438440,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1423262114,"content":"Now, for the love of the sweet almighty god, please DO NOT create another trait they will not develop in ages.

I definitely consider my self from the movieside, but just because I won't put myself through the torture of reading the most dry, boring, awful writing this side of Moby D*ck doesn't mean I don't like learning about 2nd Age stuff or the history of the characters.\n\n \n\n \n\nPS.
