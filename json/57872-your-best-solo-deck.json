Mirkwood, Anduin, Emyn muil, Gollum, Dol Guldur and Carrock (with a score of 117, did not track other score as i just saw the errata on number of turn for scoring recently). Still have Rosgobel to try.\n\nSneak attack and Gandalf seem to be the key in solo. My other deck (mix of Lore with Boromir) do not perform so well in solo play. I came to the conclusion Purple and blue are the two best sphere in solo.\n\nAnyone had good result with different combinaison in solo?\n\nCheer!\n\nAragorn 12\nEowyn 9\nDunhere 8\n\nNorthern tracker 3\nFaramir 2\nEscort from edoras 2\nsnowborn scout 3\nEomund 3\nwesfold horse-breakder 2\nThe riddermark finest 2\nGandalf 3\n\nstewart of gondor 3\ndunedain warning 3\nsneak attack 3\ncelebrian stone 1\ndunedain mark 3\ndunedain quest 2\ngaladhrim's greeting 2\na test of will 3\nstand and fight 3\ndwarven tomb 1\npower in the earth 2\nunexpected courage 1\nancient mathom 3\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57872-your-best-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=570286","commentId":570286,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1324516391,"content":"Hi broche, welcome to the forums!\n\nLots of good conversation to be had here.\n\nIf you're interested in some solo deck success, I've been hosting various tournaments (including a 3rd Solo Player tournament that is still active this week) on the forums here, and you'd be most welcome to take a look and at least see what heroes people are using. Sometimes people post the full decks they used (like you did here) or other specific details too. If you click on the link to the Hall of Fame thread in my signature, you can find links to the other threads that highlight the different tournaments. Sounds like the solo ones may interest you the most. You're welcome to join in the fun too... everyone is welcome!\n\njuicebox"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57872-your-best-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=570314","commentId":570314,"userName":"Maggical","timestamp":1324534508,"content":"I've been playing a deck using Eowyn, Dunhere and Theodred for a while now, and have it quite polished.

Eowyn: Almost a must in solo, since she worth in average 2 shadow cards in the SA by herself\n\n2. Sneak attack/Gandalf: Gandalf is the most powerful character, and playing in multiple time proved so far to be the only way to beat high difficulty quest, and to accomplish a high score.\n\n3.
