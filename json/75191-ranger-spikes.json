I can still optionally enagage the enemy, though, right?\n\nIf the enemy it has \"spiked\" gets discarded, the spikes are also discarded, right? First time i read the card, I thought they would return to the staging area to attach to the next enemy, but now I can't see why I thought that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75191-ranger-spikes/?do=findComment&comment=730968","commentId":730968,"userName":"impaulm","timestamp":1354802556,"content":"The spikes still allow you to optionally engage the enemy. I am pretty certain that it would only be discarded when the enemy dies, so if a shadow card sends the enemy back to the staging area before it does, I guess the card's effect returns?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75191-ranger-spikes/?do=findComment&comment=730986","commentId":730986,"userName":"kennoastic","timestamp":1354805067,"content":"CaffeineAddict said:\n\nIf the enemy it has \"spiked\" gets discarded, the spikes are also discarded, right?

The problems with the similar cards like Expecting Mischief is that it requires scouting, Henamarth, Denethor, etc. Even Ithilien Tracker is much better with scouting. While the Spikes also benefit from the similar strategy, the fact that it can linger in the staging area for an enemy is great. The card has come handy especially in Pelargir, for us."}]}
