Four of the 'Song' cards add a resource icon to the attached character. That doesnt mean that they get an additional resource on their turn, just that their resource now counts as either/both the original sphere and the new sphere for that Song card, right?\n\n2. When you attach an Attachment to a character, and the Attachment has text that says 'Exhaust [attachment name] to do X', does that mean just to exhaust the Attachment or does the character it is on also get exhausted?\n\n \n\nThanks for the help! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70205-2-newb-type-questions/?do=findComment&comment=685218","commentId":685218,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1346340176,"content":"hey\n\n1.no extra resources just the sphere icon\n\n2.the character exhausts seperate from the attatchmentm so will stay ready\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70205-2-newb-type-questions/?do=findComment&comment=685220","commentId":685220,"userName":"TheDisturbed1","timestamp":1346340316,"content":"Thanks for the quick answers!\n\nAlso, your Tolkienology series was really good.
