This is because those are the only quests so far in my collection (first two cycles and first two LotR saga boxes) that have been come too easy or blah for me, so I got the Nightmare decks to liven the quests up.\n\n \n\nI am tempted to grab the Watcher in the Water deck, just because that quest is the one I have played the most and I'm curious as to how the deck would change the gameplay. But by no means am I finding Watcher in the Water to be easy, so I'm afraid a Nightmare addition might just frustrate me."}]}
