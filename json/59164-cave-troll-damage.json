The key phrase, as you noted, is \"for each.\" If there is four excess damage from the initial attack, you treat each point separately. This is important because it means that you can't simply assign all the excess damage to a single Snowbourn Scout; since the damage is assigned point-by-point, the Scout will die before it can absorb more than one damage.\n\nKeep in mind that this interaction could certainly change based on a ruling from the designers. They might have intended for the Cave Troll to only damage one additional character. Until such a clarification is issued, though, the use of \"for each\" definitely means excess damage is assigned point-by-point."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59164-cave-troll-damage/?do=findComment&comment=581291","commentId":581291,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1326887121,"content":" Looking again at the card text and all your answers, could it be that if there is excess damage, the amount of excess damage must be spread out over the same amount of player characters as there is excess damage, if able.  In other words, if 3 excess damage, then you must deal 1 damage to 3 other characters if possible instead of just 3 damage to 1 character like. gandalf for example."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59164-cave-troll-damage/?do=findComment&comment=581306","commentId":581306,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1326888673,"content":"Zjb12 said:\n\n Looking again at the card text and all your answers, could it be that if there is excess damage, the amount of excess damage must be spread out over the same amount of player characters as there is excess damage, if able.  In other words, if 3 excess damage, then you must deal 1 damage to 3 other characters if possible instead of just 3 damage to 1 character like. gandalf for example.\n\n\n\nno i wouldnt think so, it says A character, not characters, i think it would specify if it was this"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59164-cave-troll-damage/?do=findComment&comment=581334","commentId":581334,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1326890280,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nZjb12 said:\n\n \n\n Looking again at the card text and all your answers, could it be that if there is excess damage, the amount of excess damage must be spread out over the same amount of player characters as there is excess damage, if able.  In other words, if 3 excess damage, then you must deal 1 damage to 3 other characters if possible instead of just 3 damage to 1 character like. gandalf for example.\n\n \n\n \n\nno i wouldnt think so, it says A character, not characters, i think it would specify if it was this\n\n\n\n \n\nI'd agree with you here.\n\nAlso, it doesn't 'double-spill' because the effect says 'extra damage from the attack'.\n\nThe spilling damage is a effect, not an attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59164-cave-troll-damage/?do=findComment&comment=582346","commentId":582346,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1327068060,"content":"so whats the deal here  has this been nate frenched yet?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59164-cave-troll-damage/?do=findComment&comment=582411","commentId":582411,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1327074560,"content":"cordeirooo said:\n\nAlso, it doesn't 'double-spill' because the effect says 'extra damage from the attack'.\n\nThe spilling damage is a effect, not an attack.\n\n\n\nwhy do you say that? The troll attacks, and that same attack resolves AFTER all dmg is applied... so this is all \"the attack\". The act of the dmg spilling to another character is still part of its attack.\n\nthe card says \"For each excess point of combat damage dealt by Cave-troll (damage that is dealt beyond the remaining hit points of the character damaged by its attack) you must damage another character you control.\"\n\nThe word \"character\" in no way defines it to only one toon at a time. This dose not need to be written as characters. What is happening is that as the dmg is applied there is a check that occurs on the character the dmg is currently getting applied to.\n\nSo the roll attacks, there is a check to see if the dmg spills, it then damages the next character, the the same check continues.\n\nIMO, there is little doubt that the dmg spills over. I have a rules check in with nate... so we will know soon... but I would be very surprised if this is not the case... frankly I can not even see how people could think it could be different.\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59164-cave-troll-damage/?do=findComment&comment=582431","commentId":582431,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1327076502,"content":"Well, I'm new to this game, so if you are some kind of rules guru I'll not discuss.\n\n \n\n \n\nI gave my opinion.

I'll explain myself:\n\nI said I wasn't going to discuss IF you are some kind of rules guru; and for obvious reasons! If you work to the company making the rules for the game, why would I try to discuss? Isn't going to help anyone or anything. I really thought you were a rules guru, because I always see you answering questions here in the forums (including my own, a few weeks before).\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, I really can't see the relation between the two yet, even with your example. If the Troll's ability is equal to Brand's, then you can only spill once. It would be like activating the same ability twice in the same window. It happens during the attack... once!\n\n \n\nAnd about the 'worth nothing', I must reiterate because, reading again, really went out very badly. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\nI meant that what I say in the forums must be get with a grain of salt, because I'm 'just' a player; I do not work for the company nor am I a freelancer tester. So, my opinion is worth as much as the guy who posted the question: if he (or anyone else) want to disagree with me, by all means, he can do it.\n\n \n\nHope it cleared up! gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59164-cave-troll-damage/?do=findComment&comment=582655","commentId":582655,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1327137418,"content":"I would have thought *and have played it this way myself* that the spill damage all gets assigned to one character until it's dead.
