I recently made the attempt to start up a central calendar for all LOTR LCG local/online groups looking for players. We have the forums here, and on BGG, and on Reddit, and so on, and they're fine, but I feel that a one-stop-shop in calendar format could be huge for people looking for games. \n\n \n\nThe link is below, so please have a look, submit your game, hit me with some suggestions, and find some buddies to play with. \n\n \n\nYes, I did post this on the 'Player Community' subforum and I'm sorry if this is spammy.\n\n \n\nhttp://greycompanypodcast.com/community-calendar/ [http://greycompanypodcast.com/community-calendar/]\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127928-lotr-community-calendar/?do=findComment&comment=1348419","commentId":1348419,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1417073563,"content":"Yeah, I too urge everybody to participate and send your events!"}]}
