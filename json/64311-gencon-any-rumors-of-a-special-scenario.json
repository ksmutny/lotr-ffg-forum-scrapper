There is no way to guarantee in any of these events that all games are played exactly per the rules. The difference in most other games is that you have competing sides or players. During the games these competing sides police eachother regarding adhearing to the rules. When a significant disagreement is encountered, the master judge or judges are brought in for a final ruling. \n\nIn LotR LCG the players are playing cooperatively against the quest and encounter deck. There is no competitive player or team to serve as an advocate for the quest or encounter deck. I believe this could easily be overcame by requiring bye rounds for each player and during those bye rounds requiring the player to serve as the quest advocate for a game that other tournament participants are playing. This player would monitor the game and point out any areas he/she believed were not being played correctly. In the event of a significant disagreement the master judge would be called in. \n\nI'd further guess that as the size of the game increases from 2 to 4 players that there is an even greater chance that the games are played and scored according to the rules. In most other 1 v 1 tournaments you only have 2 sets of eyes where in a 4 player game under this format you'd have 5!  It's by no means perfect and again you bring up a valid point. It it is one that can be overcame. \n\nI know I'm not an active poster here but I have tons of experience in playing and running tournaments in other gaming systems. I really like LotR LCG and would be happy to support efforts to get some sort of organized play going. I will be at Gen Con and plan on participating in 3 large tournaments for other systems but will be happy to carve out some time to play or volunteer with LotR LCG games. \n\nThe thing I have been struggling with is how to deal with heroes and uniques. So far the best I have been able to come up with is allowing multiple copies in the same game but only 1 copy under each players control. I know there are flaws in that but if you want to get each player to play multiple games with the same deck i dont know how to get around it. If there are any other ideas out there I'd like to hear them. \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64311-gencon-any-rumors-of-a-special-scenario/?do=findComment&comment=632326","commentId":632326,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1337252537,"content":" So what's the likelihood that they'll hold off on Shadow and Flame until GenCon and have it released there first before shipping it to the retailers?

My preference would be for 2-player pods in groups of 4. Each player must bring a legal 50-minimum card deck as defined in the rulebook. Each player may also bring up to 10 cards that they may either add to the deck, or exchange for cards in their deck before the start of each game. Each tournament round may last no more than 60 minutes, and each game within tournament rounds may take no more than 25 minutes. Any team still playing when time is called within the tournament round has lost the encounter and scores no points.\n\nBasically you have 1 or 2 judges overseeing the entire event. At each table, the 2 teams roll off to see who goes first. The team who wins the roll goes second, and gets to pick the encounter their opponents' team will play against. The team playing first then has 3 minutes to adjust their decks using their extra cards as explained above. The other team watches the first playing team's game, and can call a judge over about any issues. It is that team's responsibility to watch for slip-ups or possible cheating (it's bound to occur) among the players. When the first team finishes their game, then they pick an encounter deck for their opponents to play. That team has the same amount of time (3 minutes) to adjust their decks before the game begins. \n\nThe results are based on scoring. A win (meaning a team defeated the encounter) is worth 4 points. If they completed the encounter in less than 15 minutes, they score an additional 2 points. If they completed it less than 20 minutes but more than 15 minutes, they score 1 additional point instead. Add this result to the scoring bracket from the core rulebook.  The team that finished faster than its opponents' team scores 2 points, and is considered the \"winner\" of the round as long as that team defeated the encounter. Teams are paired randomly in the first round, with winning teams facing teams of similar or equal scoring results as much as possible in subsequent rounds. Play continues in this way\n\nAt the end of the entire tournament, the team with the most points wins. In the event of a tie, the team with the most wins during the tournament wins. If there is still a tie, and one of those teams defeated the other in a previous round, that team is the winner. If there is still a tie, then those teams must play off to determine the final winner.\n\nChallenge Level 7 or higher encounters are not legal for tournament play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64311-gencon-any-rumors-of-a-special-scenario/?do=findComment&comment=632894","commentId":632894,"userName":"badash56","timestamp":1337348563,"content":"So who is all going to GenCon?\n\nIf there is no official event maybe we could all meet up and play some games?"}]}
