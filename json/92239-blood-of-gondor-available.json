BR is not too difficult, which is fine, because the quests are really interesting, and there are cool decisions to be made, and the scenarios usually cannot be won in a few rounds. There is more game to them, which makes me feel like I have accomplished something when I complete each scenario. I don't have to loss to enjoy the game, but I would like scenarios that give me more than a few rounds of play before I win. With a longer scenario designs at least there is more of a chance for things to go wrong, or I may even threat out. Another scenario card for Amon Din, AOO, and BoG could have made these quests a much better experience and gave the scenarios more effort to complete. SF and TDF have more game to them because of this. Of course this is all from a solo perspective.\n\nMaybe this cycle has been a reboot for new players to get into the game, since they may not have all the player cards to work with. maybe the scenarios are easier when a player has access to the complete set of player cards.\n\nI would love to hear a new players perspective on this.

new quests have to be both accessible to keep to the 'lcg' format but also provide enough of a challenge to keep older gamers satisfied.\n\n \n\nif this is to get new players into the game then i am all for it, hopefully it works. more players = more life for the game\n\n \n\nrich\n\nEdited October 20, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92239-blood-of-gondor-available/?do=findComment&comment=892667","commentId":892667,"userName":"13thcaesar","timestamp":1382276065,"content":"I tested four decks for 4 players (in December wants to play campaigns Lotr with my group, so I tried to create four good decks).\n \nI played  Cycle Against Shadow (to AOO, BOG is waiting for me in Poland) -

Used and tweaked my Hobbit deck a bit. Lost most of the time, but finally won it. Pretty tough one, though tactics decks should have it easier. Nice design though a bit complicated with all these new rules and card effects.\n\n \n\n \n\nAs for the ongoing discussion about scenarios being too easy or too difficult:\n\n \n\nAs I see it there are mainly two ways to design a quest:\n\n \n\n1) Make the quest difficult, so that only 2 or 3 special designed decks are able to win\n\n \n\n2) Make the scenario easier, so that players can build a variety of decks to beat it\n\n \n\n \n\nCurrently we have a good mix of both attempts. SF is a scenario that is (way too for my taste) difficult in solo mode and challenging in two-handed mode. Amon Din is a scenario that can be beaten easily with a proper deck, but players can be creative and test multiple decks against it.\n\n \n\nI prefer the second attempt myself. Building themed decks that might not be the most powerful, but can still beat a scenario is a challenge that is so much more fun than simply putting three Test of Will in your hand, playing Sneak Gandalf and letting Asfaloth ding all the dirty exploration all of the time. Or to put an army of Dwarves in with bilion synergies in your deck.\n\n \n\nEach scenario can be fun, if you only forget about building the best deck possible.

Restrict yourself!\n\nI have been restricting myself, i don't play outlands or dwarves anymore. I'm starting to eliminate sp Glorfindel from my decks. I'm designing decks that I consider to be sub par and experimental, meaning that i have not landed on the right synergy for the deck. These decks are interesting and fun to play, but i am kind of shocked when i play a deck like this against a new scenario and it wins first try. That type of experience kind of puts a dead end to the deck building experince, since i am already using a deck that in my opinion is mediocre and still needs more tweaking.\n\nWhat am i to do? Make an an even worse deck to enjoy the game. The challenge of the game then starts to become how weak of a deck can i make to beat an easy scenario, rather than how can I make a great deck to take on the challenge of a difficult scenario.\n\nRich's question about player accessibility may play into this cycle. I think an interview with the Caleb mentioned that they also playtest the whole cycle with just the cards from the core, delux expansion and the current cycle. So, if they are expecting a player to get victories with just those products, then a player who has three cores and everything else is probably going to feel these scenarios are easier.\n\nMy fear for the veteran players is that each deluxe expansion and the following cycle may look similar in terms of difficulty, since FFG will want to make sure they can continue to pull in new players with each new cycle, and give them some success to want to continue playing. Probably one scenario each cycle will be really big challenge, in this cycle i hope that will be Morgul Vale, although I must say HoN scenarios did deliver, but many players were outraged by the difficulty, so we might not see that again.\n\nThe challenge for veteran players is going to come with nightmare packs, which at this point I agree Glaurung that they should be made available on release of the AP, since it will ensure that new players and old will be satisfied right away."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92239-blood-of-gondor-available/?do=findComment&comment=898033","commentId":898033,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1382969452,"content":"Here's a suggestion (I haven't tried yet):\n\n \n\nFor easier scenarios, just treat the number of players as +1.  If you're soloing, reveal 2 cards during staging and Archery X (number of players) becomes 2 for example.  That would ramp up the challenge substantially for solo players and still quite a bit for 2-3 players. \n\n \n\nIf you try it, let us know how well it works."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92239-blood-of-gondor-available/?do=findComment&comment=898076","commentId":898076,"userName":"koriakin97","timestamp":1382973171,"content":"I don't think they will publish nightmare along with normal pack, as they said that they response to player strategies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92239-blood-of-gondor-available/?do=findComment&comment=898185","commentId":898185,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1382981801,"content":"> What am i to do?

Choose a theme, build a deck and try to master the scenario with a deck that at first glance isn't designed to beat the scenario. Try a Hobbit deck against BoG, for example. I am having tons of fun right now, as BoG allows you to make a lot of tactical decisions, and the Hobbits' traits play right into that.\n\n \n\nPerhaps the true problem does not lie within the scenarios, but it is caused by over-powered player cards?\n\n \n\nI stand with my opinion that BoG is a tough scenario when you're not using tactics decks. Yes, the second stage could be a bit more challenging, as I rarely have hidden cards when I enter this stage. But the first stage is full of making tough decisions and I seldom found myself thinking that long about which card to play.\n\n \n\nThe second thing that is a bit bothersome are all these new mechanisms and card effects. I wouldn't be able to finish this scenario in 15 minutes even if I wanted to, because I still have to check the encounter cards' tetxts carefully.\n\n \n\nOtherwise: excellent scenario!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92239-blood-of-gondor-available/?do=findComment&comment=898274","commentId":898274,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1382988403,"content":"> Here's a suggestion (I haven't tried yet):\n> \n>  \n> \n> For easier scenarios, just treat the number of players as +1.  If you're soloing, reveal 2 cards during staging and Archery X (number of players) becomes 2 for example.  That would ramp up the challenge substantially for solo players and still quite a bit for 2-3 players. \n> \n>  \n> \n> If you try it, let us know how well it works.\n\n \n\nI quite like that idea, I'll give it a go.
