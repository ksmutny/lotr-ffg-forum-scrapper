I put gandalf in but didn't use any ability as his text box was considered \"empty.\". But, because it was empty, I also didn't discard him at the end of the round as usual. Thus, the next round, using him and questing everyone, I was able to win. Is that a fair understanding since the lord of the dead renders all but trait in a characters bo empty. I think so."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96456-stone-of-erech-lord-of-the-dead-and-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=948038","commentId":948038,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1389116220,"content":"Seems correct."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96456-stone-of-erech-lord-of-the-dead-and-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=949124","commentId":949124,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1389209724,"content":"Yes I also do same.... actually SOE is really bad quest for POD.
