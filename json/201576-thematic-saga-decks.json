I have a huge favor to ask of you all, but perhaps your response will be a service to a lot more players than just me.\n\n \n\nKnowing that the Saga expansions are not all out yet, I would still like to start playing through them thematically (something I have not done before). Deck building is not one of my strong suits, so I am wondering if I could implore your collective wisdom.\n\n \n\nAssuming there are two players (or solo two-handed), and assuming access to all expansions and adventure packs currently released, I would like to see two thematic decks for each quest in the Saga expansions...\n\n \n\nFor example, looking at \"A Shadow from the Past\" in the Black Riders expansion - what two thematic decks would be good to use?

(For me, the place in the saga where that's most thematically significant is the last two quests of The Treason of Saruman: I don't want Merry and Pippin at Helm's Deep, but I want them for The Road to Isengard. We'll almost certainly get Merry and Pippin allies within the next year or two, however, and that would solve the problem.) How strictly thematic do you want to be? As the card pool grows, there are are more options, so you could restrict your Black Riders decks to cards that fit a Hobbit/Dúnedain/Noldor theme, but will you allow for a couple of strong cards that don't fit the theme? A loosely thematic deck might allow for ally Faramir, and a strictly thematic deck might exclude Steward of Gondor (which is at least slightly thematic on Aragorn, given the favour he received from the steward Ecthelion when he served Gondor under the name Thorongil). For a pair of loosely thematic campaign mode decks, take a look at these decks (with a great playthrough writeup) from Ian (Raven1015) at Tales from the Cards: https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/campaign-mode-shadow-of-the-past/ [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/campaign-mode-shadow-of-the-past/]\n\n \n\nYou could revise them to make them more thematic (replace Éowyn with Arwen or Idraen, while adding more willpower) and include newer strong cards. Alternatively, you could try a more aggressive Dúnedain-focused deck that wants engaged enemies (Guardian of Arnor together with Steward of Gondor, Blood of Númenor and plenty of readying might be essential, and Forest Snare might help; this is a somewhat difficult deck) and a Hobbit-focused willpower/support deck. There's a bit of anti-synergy with Dúnedain and Hobbits, though. Hobbits generally want to optionally engage enemies, while Dúnedain want enemies engaged with them; Tactics Aragorn might help. If you tell me more specifically what you want, I can try to come up with something."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201576-thematic-saga-decks/?do=findComment&comment=2035815","commentId":2035815,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1454708448,"content":"The two-handed requirement is tough.  The obvious thematic mix for \"Shadows of the Past\" is Sam/Merry/Pippin to go with Fellowship.  Since there's no Gildor hero, only Fatty is actually physically present for the second deck.  There aren't any made-up Noldor to go with Fatty, though if you go backwards in time you could pair him with Gandalf and Bilbo.\n\n \n\n\"Knife in the Dark\" you lose Fatty but can add Aragorn.  Still not enough heroes for two three-hero decks.\n\n \n\n\"Flight to the Ford\" you could add Glorfindel and Elrond (for the rising of the river).  That at least gets you to six heroes.\n\n \n\nFor \"The Ring Goes South\" and \"Journey in the Dark\" you have all eight fellowship members available to go with Frodo.\n\n \n\nFor \"Breaking of the Fellowship\" Gandalf is out, but Galadriel would be quite thematic (since she can't quest/defend/attack, not being present isn't an obstacle)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201576-thematic-saga-decks/?do=findComment&comment=2035905","commentId":2035905,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1454712663,"content":"> In the context of the Lord of the Rings, there is nothing more thematic than an unexpected company of vastly different individuals coming together to rise up against evil.

Thank you! Even more detailed decks would of course be welcome. I agree that it would be too tiresome to switch heroes and decks after each quest (and it would defeat the purpose of campaign play).
