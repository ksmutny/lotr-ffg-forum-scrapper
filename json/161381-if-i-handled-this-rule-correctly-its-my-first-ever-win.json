If an attack is undefended you can assign the damage to any of your heroes*. In any case, as far as the game state is concerned, there is no such thing as being 'slated to block' an enemy. Deciding that a certain character will handle the defence is part of your own forward planning and has no effect on the game until you actually enact it by declaring them as the defender.\n\n \n\n*Actually in some later scenarios there are exceptions to this when an encounter card effect states that an enemy attacks a specific character, but in general it's true, and these exceptions are a long way from Passage Through Mirkwood."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/161381-if-i-handled-this-rule-correctly-its-my-first-ever-win/?do=findComment&comment=1551769","commentId":1551769,"userName":"Casaubon","timestamp":1428626989,"content":"Thanks for the clarification.  Now to celebrate by getting absolutely destroyed by Journey Down the Anduin!"}]}
