Normally Ill build a deck for me and my buddy to tackle the scenario, however this year it is up to 12 players in one scenario!! That just sounds incredible. So, I just wanna see if anyone else in the forums is doing it and how you are building your deck. Do you build a couple to cover the group? Like a tank build, or a heavy quester build, or a straight killer deck, or try to be as well balanced as you can? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222657-lotr-gencon-event/?do=findComment&comment=2267035","commentId":2267035,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1465953250,"content":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219285-the-siege-of-annuminas-gen-con-2016-quest/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219285-the-siege-of-annuminas-gen-con-2016-quest/]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222657-lotr-gencon-event/?do=findComment&comment=2268640","commentId":2268640,"userName":"JsBingley","timestamp":1466046383,"content":"The siege of Annu sounds really exciting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222657-lotr-gencon-event/?do=findComment&comment=2268955","commentId":2268955,"userName":"awp832","timestamp":1466078889,"content":"well, I'll be there.   My plan is I think to bring a few decks, with a variety of uses.   One heavy combat, one heavy questing, and one that is about equal parts.  I'm trying to stay away from characters who I expect will be showing up all over the place, but I'm hoping that between three decks I will have one with no conflict with other players,  since I am unfortunately down a partner and am going to have to join somebody else's team."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222657-lotr-gencon-event/?do=findComment&comment=2270346","commentId":2270346,"userName":"Bullgator","timestamp":1466120668,"content":"You know?
