In fact, some successful strategies in that particular scenario are centered around using Northern Tracker and other similar effects to explore Rhosgobel prior to Stage 2 of the quest, thereby allowing allowing players to heal Wilyador more effectively (something you picked up on).\n\nIt's perfectly legal."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69069-rhosgobel/?do=findComment&comment=674777","commentId":674777,"userName":"joeyman3","timestamp":1345120040,"content":"Thanks man.  That definitely cuts some of the luck factor out."}]}
