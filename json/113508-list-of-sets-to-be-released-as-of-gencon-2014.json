Maybe they'll announce it next week.\n\n \n\nHero speculation: assuming 2 non-Fellowship heroes in each remaining Saga Expansion, and assuming they want to even out the number of heroes per sphere across the Saga Expansions, we should be getting 2 Tactics heroes, 1 Leadership, and 1 Spirit. I think Flame of the West will be Tactics Imrahil and Spirit Éomer, and the last box will be Tactics Gwaihir and Leadership Frodo, along with Fellowship Sam. I don't think they'll repeat core set or saga heroes, so there are limited options for a Gondor hero and Imrahil seems likely. Éomer is a major character in Return of the King absent from the Core set and Saga expansions, but he might show up as an ally and Halbarad as a hero (since we're following Aragorn's story and we've already received a few Rohan saga cards). Storywise, there are limited options for heroes in the last saga expansion, and Gwaihir would fit for Tactics if they want a tactics hero in each box. Fellowship Sam and a non-fellowship Frodo would add options for playing the saga quests, and Leadership seems a better fit than Tactics for Frodo (and we already have Spirit Frodo)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113508-list-of-sets-to-be-released-as-of-gencon-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1896138","commentId":1896138,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1447715590,"content":"Agree with Gizlivadi, it does seem like they are really holding back on announcing Flame of the West. But I guess its hard to know that unless you've seen the blurb in the Land of Shadow rulebook. This is the tiny morsel we get about FoW:\n\n \n\n...In this follow up to The Treason of Saruman, you will find three scenarios spanning the second half of The Two Towers. The adventure continues in The Lord of the Rings: The Flame of the West Saga Expansion with scenarios that bring to life the events from the first half of The Return of the King.\n\n \n\nRegarding heroes in Flame of the West I assumed that we'll see Tactics or Leadership Eowyn considering her role at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Especially since there are currently no female heros in either Tactics or Leadership (currently all female heros are either Lore or Spirit IIRC). But perhaps she'll be included as an ally instead. I'm also assuming Aragorn returns as our Fellowship hero. As to the other hero, Imrahil or Eomer seem like pretty good candidates.\n\nEdited November 16, 2015 by RobOz"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113508-list-of-sets-to-be-released-as-of-gencon-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1896231","commentId":1896231,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1447721253,"content":"Since Rohan is mostly red-blue I think we'll see Tactics Eowyn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113508-list-of-sets-to-be-released-as-of-gencon-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1896242","commentId":1896242,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1447721898,"content":"I'd be very disappointed if we didn't get a Tactics Eowyn hero.

But on the other hand, the sphere division system in this game just begs for a Tactics Eowyn for this part of the book, and since it is such an iconic moment and character, she should defonately be a hero IMO."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113508-list-of-sets-to-be-released-as-of-gencon-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1896252","commentId":1896252,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1447722476,"content":"Yeah, I also want to see a Tactics Eowyn hero.

So far the designers have avoided repeating core set heroes in the Saga expansions, since some players only buy the Saga expansions (though Glóin, Gimli, and Legolas have all appeared as allies in Saga expansions).
