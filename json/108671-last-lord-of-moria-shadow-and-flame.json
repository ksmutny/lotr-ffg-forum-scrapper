Gilthonial! will not send it to the bottom of the encounter deck. This does create a problem with the text on Dark Pit. That card will receive an erratum in the next FAQ to explain that its ability supersedes the game text on Durin's Bane, making it possible for players to defeat the scenario the way it was intended. In the meantime, please play the scenario as if the last line of Dark Pit reads \"This effect supersedes the game text on Durin's Bane.\"\nThanks,\nCaleb\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd as far as I can see, that errata never happened."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108671-last-lord-of-moria-shadow-and-flame/?do=findComment&comment=1121508","commentId":1121508,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1402811691,"content":"> Thank you alogos.\n> \n> I agree with you.\n> \n> But if the progress point isn't needed why is it present on the card?\n> \n> The only way to destroy the balrog is with the Dark Pit's effect, so it seems useless.\n> \n> Perhaps there are other methods to discard the balrog different from Dark Pit's effect?\n\n \n\nMy response for the past year was that FFG was trolling... like why some cards have some stats that are never used.

I'm not sure about that.
