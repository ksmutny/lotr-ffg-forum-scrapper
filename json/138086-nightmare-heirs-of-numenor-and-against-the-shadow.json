The Stewards Fear.\n\nI thought I would be able to beat Druadan Forest, Peril in Pelargir and Encounter at Amon Din within a few attempts but so far I have racked up about 4 losses against Druadan Forest, 3 losses against Encounter and 2 losses against Peril in Pelargir. Into Ithilien and Siege of Cair Andros I dare not even touch yet. Also with Steward I had INSANE luck all the way through, god like starting hands and plenty of strategy.\nNow yes this is only a handful of attempts against each but from these few games I can already tell it may take MANY many attempts to beat Druadan Forest or Peril in Pelargir. I was unable to advance from stage 1 on any of the games I did for these two quests, with Encounter at Amon Din I was able to get to stage 2 at least. \n\nDruadan I get UTTERLY clobbered, Encounter is **** hard but probably the least nasty of the three and Peril is also insane as unless you clear the Leaping Fish first or second turn you are in for some serious hurt. Like I said I have not tried Into Ithilien or Siege of Cair Andros but both look utterly diabolical. I can only imagine what Nightmare Assault on Osgiliath, The Blood of Gondor and The Morgul Vale will be like....!\n\n \n\nEssentially I have found that they are far far harder than the nightmare quests for the first and second deluxe box/cycles. Towards the end of the Dwarrowdwelf cycle the last two Nightmare quests are pretty difficult and I have thus to win a game against either but the first 7 nightmare quests for that deluxe/cycle I was able to beat fairly quickly or eventually over several attempts. As well as this Shadow and Flame is legitimately already a very hard quest so the nightmare version should be that difficult, as for Foundations of Stone if you play with more than one player it is hard because you get separated at the end and because my two decks (two handed) compliment each other so well they suffer quite badly on their own so it makes sense that this particular nightmare quest is extremely hard for me. \n\nThis cycle of Nightmare decks however just seems substantially harder from the very get go with the very first quest and only gets harder.\n\n \n\nNow yes Against the Shadow and Heirs are some of the hardest quests in the game on their own minus Nightmare play so it makes sense that these nightmare decks would be the hardest so far but I'm starting to think that some of them can only be beaten by Dwarves, Outlands or Elrond/Gandalf/Spiritfindel or potentially by playing solo. I'm struggling to see how I could potentially beat them (without resorting to using one of these types of decks which I will not do) and am finding them less fun and challenging than usual and instead just way too punishing. Often first or second turn you get some truly nightmarish encounter reveals that you KNOW you cannot come back from unless you get the perfect hand (and even then stand little chance!!!) and it is fairly disheartening to feel so helpless and doomed that quickly especially after SO MUCH set up time (especially for nightmare) and getting player decks and your playing space all ready. There also seems to be even more surge than usual in the new nightmare quests and a few even feature (no jokes) more nightmare cards than regular cards in the encounter deck....\n\n \n\nI really hope that this is BECAUSE this deluxe and cycle are already the hardest of any to date (including Ring Maker which has its difficult quests but does not have anything like Morgul Vale, Into Ithilien or Siege of Cair Andros) and so the nightmare versions are also the hardest of any to date and that it is not just an overall increase in the general difficulty of nightmare quests. \n\n \n\nI really really love the art, mechanics and theme of all nightmare decks released to date even including these new uber hard ones and love the challenge as well but really hope it goes back to being much tougher quests that take several more attempts than the normal quest (except for the hardest few quests in a cycle, the nightmare version to these can still be extremely difficult, this makes far more sense) to beat rather than these insanely hard uber nightmare packs. I'll still get and play them either way but the game is already hard enough please put nightmare back to nightmare difficulty and save this double nightmare stuff for POD like Lake Town. \n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/138086-nightmare-heirs-of-numenor-and-against-the-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1493164","commentId":1493164,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1426576670,"content":"Have you used a generic deck against those, or built specificly against them?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/138086-nightmare-heirs-of-numenor-and-against-the-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1493167","commentId":1493167,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1426577307,"content":"I've beaten Nightmare Into Ithilien with a purpose built deck (https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/breaking-news-giant-bear-dominates-in-battle-none-surprised/ [https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/breaking-news-giant-bear-dominates-in-battle-none-surprised/]) and I just beat Steward's Fear Nightmare this weekend in a two-player game.
