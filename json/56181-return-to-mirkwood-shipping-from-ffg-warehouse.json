You can see that he is practically begging Gandalf for assistance on that bridge. Unfortunately for him, Gandalf doesn't speak Balrog."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56181-return-to-mirkwood-shipping-from-ffg-warehouse/?do=findComment&comment=555387","commentId":555387,"userName":"player582283","timestamp":1321175842,"content":"Marlow - those parts must have been in the Unfinished Tales.  It's a shame Tolkien did not get them in the trilogy as it sounds very exciting"}]}
