If you quest successfully this phase and Bofur is still in play, return him to your hand.\n\nMy Question: if I don't quest successfully and he is still in play, then does he remain in play?  Or did they mean to imply that he leaves play? \n\nNot that I often set out to not succeed at questing, but it it gets me an ally for 2 less resources, I may consider it some time (especially if I can hit the sweet spot of exactly matching threat ...)\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61908-bofur-question/?do=findComment&comment=606224","commentId":606224,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1331854870,"content":"yes that is what it means, if you fail the quest he stays in play.\n\n7775589.png [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7775589/img/7775589.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61908-bofur-question/?do=findComment&comment=606342","commentId":606342,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1331890155,"content":" I also interpreted it that way. Once something is put in play, it stays in play unless something on the card says otherwise (like Gandalf or Sneak Attack). I think Bofur is a great Spirit card, especially if you run Dain (or one of your teammates do). For 1 ressource, you can add 3 willpower, and if it doesn't work, you have a new ally at a discount. Pretty neat !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61908-bofur-question/?do=findComment&comment=606516","commentId":606516,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1331931324,"content":"In addition, a friendly reminder: if your commited will power total = threat total in staging area, you neither quest successfully nor unsuccessfully, so Bofur will stay, too!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61908-bofur-question/?do=findComment&comment=606546","commentId":606546,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1331947701,"content":"Thanks for the responses - Bofur (together with Dain) is going to be seeing a lot of use in my dwarf themed decks.\n\nAngus Lee said:\n\nIn addition, a friendly reminder: if your commited will power total = threat total in staging area, you neither quest successfully nor unsuccessfully, so Bofur will stay, too!\n\n\n\nI realized that - hence my comment about hitting the sweet spot of exactly matching threat."}]}
