I missed the boat for pre-ordering the early stuff like Dunwich Legacy, so now I have to wait for it to come back in stock again. It's only a mild interest, so I haven't been checking every day or anything--more like once a week. In the past, that has been sufficient for me to get my hands on games I'm interested in, but with this one I missed both the initial print run and the first reprint because I just wasn't fast enough.\n\nI'll get it eventually.

The other two remaining packs of the Harad-cycle are still \"In Development\" which is very sad especially considering the fact that the deluxe box came out in late 2016.
