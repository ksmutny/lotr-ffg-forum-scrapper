Welcome to The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame. Every time I host a tournament, it concludes with a Top Ten listing that ranks players who finished the tournament with the top ten best results. What follows here is an ongoing (living, if you will) compilation of all of the Top Tens from all completed tournaments.\n\nHall of Fame placements are scored as follows: in each tournament a #1 ranked placement earns the participant 10 points, a #2 ranked placement earns the participant 9 points, a #3 ranked placement earns the participant 8 points, and so on all the way down to a #10 ranked placement earning the participant 1 point.\n\nAs every ranked placement counts toward that participant’s overall grand total, the Top Ten Hall of Fame reflects the current listing of the ten grandest of all grand totals. Nice work Hall of Famers! You’re an inspiration to us all! \n\nThe juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame:\n\n1. muemakan ~ 105\n2. leptokurt ~ 66\n3. Chac ~ 59\n4. wraith428 ~ 58\n5.

Personally, I do think that would be fun. It would let people know how close they are to being promoted to the Hall of Fame Top Ten or to being relegated to the Honorable Mentions, and it would also showcase the success of new players to the tournaments. After all, over time, those of us who have been playing and getting results from the beginning will have an advantage in the overall landscape. (Plus, there's also the concern that I myself am in danger of facing relegation, and quick! gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]) In any case, I don't want that to discourage new players from joining in the fun.\n\nSo, an added comprehensive Honorable Mentions listing...\n\nWould you enjoy something like that?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56820-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-top-ten-hall-of-fame/?do=findComment&comment=571298","commentId":571298,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1324851618,"content":" Yes, that would be great.  So, for example, I am assuming I scored four points from the tourney that ended last night having attained a 7th place.  Overall am I say, 20th or 13th, or where?  ( I am not asking you to tell me neccessarily, just hypothetically.  )  But it would be good to know at some point.  Or start a different thread that only lists the overall scores through the first 3 tourneys, then update after each new tourney.  But, I know that's a lot of work too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56820-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-top-ten-hall-of-fame/?do=findComment&comment=571431","commentId":571431,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1324904654,"content":"Okay, here's my plan...\n\nAt the end of this week/month/year (all the same thing) I'll begin including an Honorable Mentions list here on the Top Ten Hall of Fame main post right after the Top Ten listing.
