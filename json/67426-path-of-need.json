Perhaps you are right. I would not call cards like the Hammersmith a waste since I've played him in many a deck without ever regretting… Have you seen the glimpse of Thror's Map in the Hobbit preview?

However, Path of Need can only unfold its whole power when the attached location is active during both quest and combat phase, so switching locations only helps you during quest or combat phase.\n\nOne deck where I think this card might help a lot is a dwarf deck. Dáin boosting the whole fellowship during the whole turn might  be worth the money. But then I ask myelf, how often I was in a situation in which I would have needed PoN. Not very often. So perhaps this card could be a joker in case the **** hits the fan, but I would still prefer to play Gandalf or Faramir instead. And, similar to Fortune or Fate,  I would try prevent a situation in which I would want to play PoN.\n\nLike I said, what I am saying is about solo play. Multiplayer is a different issue, as there are more heroes who will benefit from PoN."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67426-path-of-need/?do=findComment&comment=658000","commentId":658000,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1342167128,"content":"In my opinion this card seriously not deserve attention for now and i really doubt it will change with time.

There is the 1/2 that said the immunity stops you casting the Mathom, while there were strong arguments to say that the Mathom in fact targets itself and not the location, so there is nvr any card effect on the location itself. It is technically targeting itself and the location going out of play is triggering the mathoms action, and that action is solely inside the mathom itself, just as a sac effect dose not trigger when you destroy a creature instead of sacing it.\n\nWhile I think the 1nd option is more correct as per the wording and rules.. I am sure it is not the intended direction of the designers. The immune effects is supposed to render the location unable to be targeted AND unable to used in trigger effects. This is a good example of the LoTR game just having really loose wording."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67426-path-of-need/?do=findComment&comment=661273","commentId":661273,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1342758644,"content":"Tromdial said:\n\nMy friend and I were debating whether this card worked where you could have the same hero defend every attack from separate monsters, and then attack each monster with the same hero (especially if with sentinel and/or range to interact with all engaged players).\n\nFor example, the first player is engaged with 3 spiders.

The more players there are the more powerful. My group (we have 4 players) have repeatedly used this card, at its worst you have exceptional action advantage, at its best it can save you from the brink of destruction. For instance, we used it recently on The Road to Rivindell Nightmare. We were playing thematic, with dwarves and gandalf. We placed Path of Need on a location in the staging area, quested the majority of our characters but everyone saved their fighters. After we beat the quest we were all engaged with a handful of enemies. We traveled to path of need and we were able to destroy every enemy in play. Then the next turn we were able to quest with every hero without exhausting. This is the best way to use path of need, place it on a location you need to travel to in the staging area, it helps you a full round in combat (badass with Gimli), then helps with questing and combat next turn (as all hero's don't exhaust to quest). Can't believe many others here haven't had such an experience, perhaps it's simply more powerful with more players, but yeah this card is a godsend. Pretty sure we are gonna need it to beat shadow and flame nightmare with our thematic decks!\n\n \n\nEdited May 19, 2018 by breedlove2"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67426-path-of-need/?do=findComment&comment=3339043","commentId":3339043,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1526715082,"content":"It might really depend on a deck, I feel.
