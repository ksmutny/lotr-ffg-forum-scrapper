I have been around since even before the game was released (although not always active in these forums), but truly, deck-building starts to take off just now. I remember the core set phase, when we just didn't have much options in terms of deckbuilding. I think the Saga Expansions helped boost the player cardpool considerably, and next to the deck-building we also have an abundance of quests to experience. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nI wonder though, the competitive LCGs basically consist only of player cards, it seems so overwhelming coming from the lotr lcg now :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95751-happy-holidays/?do=findComment&comment=951642","commentId":951642,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1389431118,"content":"Yeah, games like Warhammer Invasion or Star Wars are just overflowing with cards - and I believe Star Wars is the newest one.\n\nBy the way, happy 200th post, faith_star83!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95751-happy-holidays/?do=findComment&comment=951761","commentId":951761,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1389455951,"content":"> Yeah, games like Warhammer Invasion or Star Wars are just overflowing with cards - and I believe Star Wars is the newest one.\n> \n> By the way, happy 200th post, faith_star83!!!\n\n \n\ni would add though, that they have a lot of factions in those games - and if you don't play (or don't like) any particular faction(s) a lot of those cards are \"dead\" to you - even if they are player cards."}]}
