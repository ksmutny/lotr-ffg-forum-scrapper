So if you loose PiP you can imagnine how that changes the story, but it's not how is was designed to be or how the Story \"officially\" Plays out.\n\nLook at it like a video game: Loose, load savegame, repeat. It's totally unrealistic, but that's the problem of the medium the stroy is told through: The Story only \"really\" advances, if it takes the turn the writer wants it to take.\n\n \n\n> I have a question about quest continuity\n> #spoileralert\n> \n>  \n> \n> If I lose Peril in Pelargir quest, and the message gets into \"wrong hands\",  do I have to fight Lord Alcaron at all in Morgul Vale?

Therefore you \"have\" to try again until it works out.\n\n \n\nNo matter how many endings stories may have, that a Player can influence, every ending only results out of something the designer accounted for. Die where you shouldn't and there will be no Version of the Story that incluedes that Happening."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221873-the-grand-scheme-of-things/?do=findComment&comment=2265705","commentId":2265705,"userName":"beregrew","timestamp":1465873806,"content":">   do I have to fight Lord Alcaron at all in Morgul Vale?\n\n*Spoiler alert\n\ni wish i saw that sooner ;-;"}]}
