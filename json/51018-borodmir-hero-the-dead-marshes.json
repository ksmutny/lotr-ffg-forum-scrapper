Justice to the character I say. I have expected the stats as well. Was perhaps thinking for a defense bonus strength as an ability but For Gondor! will already make Boromir even more great.\n\nThe Spirit Tactics combination has been most pronounced from the start I believe, and this really strengthen that trend. Close to the end of the game, Boromir's abilities may be priceless. The thereat ready action can really save you a game at the start as well. And I am really looking forward to including him in my deck. How about Boromir, Eleanor, Imrahil as a Gondor squad?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51018-borodmir-hero-the-dead-marshes/?do=findComment&comment=510176","commentId":510176,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1312678586,"content":" Wow, very cool!

I like art!!! My favorite hero in the book looks really like i image him.\n\n\n\nYeah, nice, still waiting for a clearer take though. It is also one of mine favourite characters from the books and I am very glad it is getting so powerful. Thematically, I find it very fitting. Boromir is known to be one of the strogest warriors of his time but the ability can get tricky, use it too much and you may get in trouble. The discard ability is extreme but if the game only requires some hits to complete (like Carrock for instance) it may be a winner, too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51018-borodmir-hero-the-dead-marshes/?do=findComment&comment=517174","commentId":517174,"userName":"BeeGentle","timestamp":1313768059,"content":"I love that Boromir is getting his own hero card, but I'm not loving the artwork all that much.\n\nI was expecting more of a battle-crazed look with his shield out while he's fighting off a bunch of baddies; he just looks like he's ready for happy hour, or lost.\n\nGood card though. Might entice me to try and make a Gondor deck.\n\nFaramir and Boromir back to back...just like the movies!...wait."}]}
