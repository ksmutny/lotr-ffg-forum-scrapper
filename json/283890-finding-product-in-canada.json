So I bought the lotr core and pieced together the first cycle last year, love it. I've been waiting to try and get my hands on the first saga or deluxe expansion and neither board game store in my city has gotten them in... for a while.\n\n \n\ni understand how the re print thing works, but I'm just wondering if any Canadian players have a good online resource for collecting the game. I would love to keep playing if I can find it!\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283890-finding-product-in-canada/?do=findComment&comment=3490801","commentId":3490801,"userName":"Seawhale","timestamp":1538546254,"content":"I just started, so I can't help you.\n\nI just decided to skip some cycle. I started with the core set and The Lost Realm. From what I can see, it's totally doable.\n\nThe first deluxe expansion is on the boat already, so just make sure you make a pre-order at your local store for the reprint... (don't know when it will hit the shelves though)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283890-finding-product-in-canada/?do=findComment&comment=3490912","commentId":3490912,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1538566613,"content":"Hi!\n\nIn Canada, you can try :\n\n-http://www.meeplemart.com/ [http://www.meeplemart.com/] (but they seem to be late for stocking new LOTR LCG stuff lately)\n\n-https://www.starlitcitadel.com/games/ [https://www.starlitcitadel.com/games/]\n\n-http://www.levalet.com/ [http://www.levalet.com/]\n\n...but I buy my LOTR stuff at https://www.miniaturemarket.com/ [https://www.miniaturemarket.com/]\nThey are in the US, but there shipping fee is super cheap, and it takes around 10 days to get your stuff.

Debating hard to pick up the collectors edition for extra dials and new cards/quests plus the sweet map and the electronic game looks solid too but I would rather have it for IOS if its going to come out there. So holding off at the moment.\n\n \n\nSuch an awesome game and my wife and I easily rank it as our favourite game right now."}]}
