Even though Elrohir can only ready himself there is no limit to his ability and he has an inherently higher base defense than Gimli (so long as you are running Elladan and why wouldn't you be). He is also a better recipient for attachments as he can receive Elven Mail, Cloak of Lorien etc. as well as the Steward/Shield combo. He too can receive Heir of Mardil and so long as he has Elven Mail attached he can receive day is rising as well.\n\nPretty much Gimli can defend once and then allow a second exhausted hero to ready and either defend or attack and thats it.\n\nElrohir can keep defending until he runs out of resources, 9 resources? 10 defenses if need be.\n\nWhat I like about the ability is the little boost it gives to Legolas. Especially if he can then make additional attacks after receiving that boost and even more so if he already took part in Hands Upon the Bow or Quick Strike earlier in the turn rather than questing. He could potentially take out 3 foes in one turn similar to Elladan except he places progress each time he kills an enemy as well!\n\nI defintely agree that Gimli's ability is a little better hence me using his new version but sticking with the old version of Legolas.\n\nI play to essentially use Gimli's ability to ready Legolas only if he has been used for Hands Upon the Bow or Quick Strike and otherwise I will use it to ready Tactics Aragorn or Elrond across the table with Elven Mail attached so that they can perform additional defensive duties. If I defend with Elrond or Aragorn before Gimli they can perform an additional defense with Gimli's ability which is especially handy if Elrond has Burning Brand attached.\n\nI plan to set up Gimli with Steward/Shield and Armoured Destrier so that he can defend multiple attacks each turn and discard shadow cards while at it whilst also readying Elrond, Legolas or Aragorn to defend an additional attack/perform an additional attack. Not going to use Dwarven Shield as Steward and Unlikely Friendship will generate more than enough resources on their own and I would rather the shadow discard and readying from Armoured Destrier anyway. When possible he will also receive UC to defend up to three attacks per turn (four with his readying of another hero).\n\nDoesn't really compare to a loaded-up Elrohir but this way I can spend Leadership resources more quickly and more safely, will have more resource ramp and card draw through Unlikely Friendship and Legolas albeit his old version replaces Elladan to also provide progress while destroying foes although without inbuilt readying."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2393322","commentId":2393322,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1472657035,"content":"I can't remember, but is it legal to put Fellowship sphere cards in your deck in a non-saga quest and pay for them with A Good Harvest?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2393323","commentId":2393323,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1472657059,"content":"It's certainly true that Elrohir's ability to repeatedly ready and defend is an advantage over LeGimli, also his 3 starting defense (with his brother).  My point is that the resource cost for Elrohir's ability isn't really seen as a knock -- leadership resources are cheap, and 1 for readying isn't bad at all, if you need it.\n\n \n\nElrohir's edge in attachments is slight.  I'll grant that for a defender the ability to get an Elven Cloak is better than LeGimli's ability to add on Boots of Erebor, since defense is more valuable than HP.  Elven Mail Gimli doesn't need -- if you spend the same 2 resources on Dwarven Mail for gimli instead of Elven Mail for Elladan, you end up with the same 3 def/6hp/sentinel line for both, with one restricted slot used.  But Gimli has the advantage in being sentinel from the start, so doesn't have to wait for Elven Mail for Day's Rising (or less likely, Raven-winged helm). Elrohir's big advantage isn't in what's attached, it's how often he can use it once he's completely set up.\n\n \n\nHowever, Elrohir's self-readying is just going to enable Elrohir defending, which is an improvement over LeGimli if what you need is another defense by Elrohir.  LeGimli's ability is better if you need defense for another deck, and Elrohir doesn't have sentinel yet, or if what you need is attacking, or if you don't actually need either an emergency defender *or* attacker, but have some hero with a useful power who is exhausted.  Just one resource and a garden variety defense, and Gimli can ready Elrond for Vilya, or Galadriel for card/threat reduction, or Gandalf/Cirdan for Narya, or LoDenethor for scrying, or Beravor for Cards.  You wouldn't construct a Elladan/Elrohir/LeGimli deck to turn Gimli into the designated defender, but I think Gimli's flexibility makes him more useful in a wider variety of decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2393335","commentId":2393335,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1472657374,"content":"> I can't remember, but is it legal to put Fellowship sphere cards in your deck in a non-saga quest and pay for them with A Good Harvest?\n\nIllegal. =(\n\n \n\nI wonder, though, if you can in a Saga Adventure use A Good Harvest to declare for Fellowship resources to pay the cost for a non-Fellowship card that needs Fellowship resources (such as Overcome By Fear)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2393365","commentId":2393365,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1472658246,"content":"> I wonder, though, if you can in a Saga Adventure use A Good Harvest to declare for Fellowship resources to pay the cost for a non-Fellowship card that needs Fellowship resources (such as Overcome By Fear).\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nAction: Name a sphere.

You use his ability while defending which is perfect. Even if you only get the one use out of Gimli it is to defend which is what you want to use him for and you get to ready another hero who can also defend or attack or exhaust to do whatever. Legolas is not built to quest.... his 3 attack and ranged mean you want to be attacking with him. If you don;t have Gimli in play or some other way to ready Legolas then he just quests and readies another questing hero. Sure this hero he readies can be a great attacker instead but Legolas is still sort of wasted questing whereas Gimli can be used effectively on a regular basis.\n\nAlso yes the discard for Legolas's ability plays into many decks strengths and when paired with Elven Light and Noldor shenanigans it can be a benefit instead of a drawback however you do still need to discard a card every time  (and possibly every turn) to trigger the ability and this will cost you tons of spirit resources if you are recycling elven light every time or if you don't have extra card draw via someone like Galdor or Erestor this may end up slightly hurting you.\n\nA similar argument can be made for Gimli's ability as you could obviously be spending his resources on other cards.\n\nLeadership has TONS of resource ramp though and he even has the dwarven shield/the day is rising combo (which yes again is similar to elven light or silver harp for Legolas) to make his ability that much more readily available etc. \n\nI don't know.. I definietly think that Gimli has a slight edge over Legolas especially when talking about only including one of them in a hero line up. That being said I am running them together in my decks and they are a great duo! I am however using the tactics version of Legolas instead of this new spirit version.  With Steward/Shield and Armoured Destrier Gimli is a beast of a defender and with some nice weapon attachments and events like Hands Upon the Bow Legolas is a fantastic attacker that thanks to Gimli can occasionally make multiple attacks without a readying attachment. Anytime that Legolas is already ready I use Gimlis ability to either ready Elrond (so he can defend as well, usually with burning brand or so that he can use Vilya) or Tactigorn (so that he can either defend or make an attack and potentially trigger his ability). Pretty much every single use of Gimli's ability is extremely beneficial and allows me to have far more of a handle on combat or allows me to overcommit to the quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228896-an-unlikely-friendship/?do=findComment&comment=2415027","commentId":2415027,"userName":"dr00","timestamp":1473918387,"content":"> Hmmmmmm I don't know I think Gimli can still definitely be great without Legolas but Legolas is definitely not great without Gimli.\n\nstill convinced of this as well.\n\n \n\nthe only time it works is with Light of Valinor with no other Silvan/Noldor heroes, but a worthwhile hero that can quest and either attack/defend that's worth discarding a card\n\n \n\nbut even then, Legolas is still questing for base 1, and as soon as any other Silvan/Noldor is in play, they're likely a much better target for LoV anyway, even with Lego's ability\n\n \n\nthat said, he's still a 3 ranged attack in spirit for 9 threat, so he can double up with Lanwyn for some decent secrecy ranged attack support Spirit deck or something.  both being scouts is pretty cool as well for that new spirit event"}]}
