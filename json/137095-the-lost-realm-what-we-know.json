Over time the card numbers have been organized differently in the Deluxe boxes for example Khazad-dum ordered the cards by spheres and Leadership and Tactics got 3 cards each while Spirit and Lore only got 2 and then 1 neutral. Heirs had a lot of player cards: 4 each of Leadership and Lore while Spirit and Tactics got 3 each. After Heirs the order of card numbers goes by type rather than sphere which only matters when we try to now figure out what future cards are! lol  Voice gave us 2 cards for Leadership, Lore and Spirit while Tactics and neutral each got 3 which is crazy for neutral but Road Darkens also had 3 neutral cards.\n\n \n\nSo, no the cards have never been divided equally and even in a couple of the last packs from the Dwarrowdelf we got 0 neutral cards and 3 Lore cards! So the designers aren't afraid to change things up a bit with lots of neutral cards or maybe an expansion with far more of one sphere.\n\n \n\nfun fact: there are currently 81 cards for Leadership, Tactics and Spirit but Lore has 84. Neutral has 32. So even though cards aren't divided equally from each pack they have still been well rounded except for Lore who has a few extra. All these ridiculous numbers have come from being obsessed with this game yet being stuck in the current drought.. hahha ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/137095-the-lost-realm-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1494731","commentId":1494731,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1426642702,"content":"I found this on the Grey Company Facebook page.  Here's what I can make of it.  These are just guesses, so correct me if I'm wrong:\n\n \n\nBorders of Bree-land\n\nArnor.\n\nWhile Borders of Bree-land is in the staging area, it gains: \"Forced: At the end of the quest phase, return 1 enemy engaged with ________ player to the staging area.\"  (The blank is probably \"each\" or \"the first\".)\n\n \n\nThe Shades of Angmar 1B\n\nWhen Revealed: Each player must search the encounter deck for a ______ [?Baleful] Shade and put it into play engaged with him.  Shuffle the encounter deck and reveal 1 encounter card per player.\n\nForced: At the end of each _______ phase, each player must discard the top card of his deck.\n\nIf a player has 0 cards in his deck, he is eliminated from the game.\n\n \n\nBiting Wind\n\nWeather.\n\nA..... _____________________ characters committed ____________________ number of characters.\n\nShadow: Deal 1 damage ___________________ character.\n\n \n\n \n\nP.S.
