It has happened before: eagles in Moria, Steward of Gondor on anyone else than Denethor or one of his sons, heroes riding two horses, the fact that we're able to use Saruman in The Road Darkens, etc. in fact the only exceptions are the rings of power we have so far and all those other character specific attachments. The game is also about \"what if\" scenarios, so just making a wizard's ring card and being able to use it on heroes is just cool, and you could invent a reason why we have it pretty easily. It's more about representing Middle Earth as thoroughly as possible, with all options available, rather than taking some of these things so literally in terms of theme.\n\nEdited November 13, 2014 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127059-race-to-the-forge/?do=findComment&comment=1333747","commentId":1333747,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1415924458,"content":"I'm at work but want to make proxies of some of these new cards real quick, does anyone have access to their cards now and can tell me the measurements of a card?
