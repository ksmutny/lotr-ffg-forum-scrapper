I thought Mariner's Compass was worded as a response precisely because there wasn't one.\n\n \n\nNothing happens specifically, but all effects (Passive, Forced, and Response) that say \"Happens at the beginning of the travel phase\" will necessarily come before the decision to travel. \n\n \n\nEffects that happen at the beginning of the resource phase (and combat phase and refresh phase) can only come before adding resources and drawing a card if they are a passive effect.  The player would get to choose to resolve the framework effect or choose to resolve any non-framework passive effect first.\n\nEdited March 20, 2016 by cmabr002"}]}
