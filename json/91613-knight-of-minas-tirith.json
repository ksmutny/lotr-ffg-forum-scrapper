The definitions for combining attacks alway reference the need to have a player engaged with an enemy first.  If fantasy flight wanted to make it clear about the inability to combine attack they could have just switched the order of engagement/attack and it would have been unambigous.  Any thoughts on the subject?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91613-knight-of-minas-tirith/?do=findComment&comment=883107","commentId":883107,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1381133434,"content":"At no point in the KoMT text does it grant the ability to exhaust multiple characters for this special attack. The ability is a response effect which means it must be fully resolved, as per the triggering condition outlined in the card text, before other effects can take place.\n\nThat text specifically states that you only exhaust KoMT to declare that specific card as an attacker.\n\n \n\nA similar ruling has been made on Quick Strike which reads:\n\nAction: Exhaust a character you control to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against any eligible enemy target.\nThat ruling states that when that event is used it only goes for one attacker.\n\nEdited October 7, 2013 by Nerdmeister"}]}
