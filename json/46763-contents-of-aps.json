The product description says 60 cards, but I would imagine that it would be somewhere around 30 new cards in various multiples since heroes, quests, and some encounter cards would be onesies or twosies. I guess the question would be, do you think the player cards are all 3-ofs? Or will we have to buy multiples packs of certain APs? I have 2 Hunt For Gollum on preorder, but I don't know if that was shrewd or a waste."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46763-contents-of-aps/?do=findComment&comment=468289","commentId":468289,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1305349781,"content":"I'm pretty sure these Adventure Packs have three copies each of 9 player cards, 1 Hero, and the Event and Quest cards for the scenario.  You don't need two copies of the Adventure Packs!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46763-contents-of-aps/?do=findComment&comment=468291","commentId":468291,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1305350194,"content":"Good to know.

I agree it is a turnoff...hopefully after this first wave of packs they change that format up a bit. They have said they want every adventure to be playable with just the core set + that pack, but that would really be missing an opportunity to combine different quest cards from different core packs. Anyways, with only 2 new cards for each sphere per pack, it's going to be quite some time before we see any real deck variety.\n\nIronically, I'd be happier if they didn't have 3x cards per pack at this point so that it would allow more variety, but it is what it is."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46763-contents-of-aps/?do=findComment&comment=468395","commentId":468395,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1305374693,"content":"It is pretty possible that out of 28-30 encounter cards, some will enhance core encounter decks.

I'm a pretty serious gamer and I like to buy lots of core sets so I can build a dozen different decks without swapping cards. I have mixed feelings on only seeing 9 new free peoples cards per AP. It does seem to make for a slow development of the game. That's a little frustrating after waiting so long for it. On the other hand, I get to \"savor the flavor\" and enjoy knowing that Fantasy Flight won't burn the game out in 4 months because they released hundreds of new cards and ran out of ideas (or got victimized by inadequate playtesting and broke their own game).\n\nIt is what it is and I'll deal with it. So will we all, for the most part. I'm just glad the game is here. The solo aspect, co-op mechanics, and amazing art help make this game well worth its $168 (Miniature Market x6 core sets) cost. Definitely a modest price when compared to Decipher prices on LOTR: TCG. That would barely buy me 2 booster boxes online back in the day.\n\nI do seem to be accumulating lots of extra encounter deck cards though...."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46763-contents-of-aps/?do=findComment&comment=468420","commentId":468420,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1305379544,"content":"Wow. You bought 6 core sets? Must be for 2 playsets of the onesies, but that's still a lot of extra cards. I agree with you on the investment value though.

For the moment I'm fine with this.\n\n\n\nI think it would be interesting to have 2 AP's per cycle (or something) have just player cards, once there is a fairly large established base of quests. That way you could do something like:\n\n1 - 2: 9 player cards per set, 1 quest\n\n3: 18 player cards per set.\n\n4: 9 player cards per set, 1 quest.\n\n5: 18 player cards per set.\n\n6: \"Finale\", 9 player cards per set, 1 quest.\n\nThen, once per year as is normal, they have a 'deluxe set' that would have a lot more player cards and maybe a larger quest. That would give us around 50 new cards per sphere per year, depending on how the deluxe sets are laid out.\n\nAnyways, we'll just have to see what they decide to do I suppose. Personally I think 7 quests a year is plenty, plus they will almost certainly come out with quests online combining the cards from different packs."}]}
