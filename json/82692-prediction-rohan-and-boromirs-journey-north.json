We know that the timeline will be between the Hobbit and the LotR books. Looking at the big stories that Tolkien wrote for this time period, most of them have already been covered (golum's story, the failed return to Moria by the dwarves, the troubles in Gondor). What's left? Tolkien specifically wrote about the corruption of Saruman, the assault on Dol Guldur, the troubles in Rohan, Boromir's journey north, and the ride of Ring Wraiths north to Hobbiton. I think Saruman's tale doesn't really lend itself to the kinds of adventures we've seen so far and I really doubt we'll go back to Dol Guldur so soon after the Mirkwood cycle.\n\nOf the stories that are left, I think Rohan lends itself nicely to a three quest deluxe expansion, and more importantly, it easily provides the encounter sets to enable Boromir's journey north to be the next AP cycle. Why do I think Boromir's tale will be next? First of all, it's a truly epic journey. Boromir travelled west from Gondor, through Rohan and the Gap and then through the wildlands and north to the ruins of Tharbad where he lost his horse trying to cross the great river Greyflood. After losing his horse he had to go the rest of the way to Rivendell on foot. This would make an amazing story, something Tolkien said himself : \"the courage and hardihood required is not fully recognized in the narrative\". That's the kind of journey I'd like to see in an AP cycle. Tolkien's lack of detail about the journey is actually a blessing to the game designers as they can have some fun filling in the details of the story. The regions around Tharbad were also not in the movies giving the designers some freedom to conceptualize them however they want. The fact that a third of the trip is through Rohan would dovetail very nicely with the Deluxe Expansion.\n\nSo there's my prediction. What do you think?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82692-prediction-rohan-and-boromirs-journey-north/?do=findComment&comment=787270","commentId":787270,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1366542344,"content":"thats an intriguing idea, though i disagree…heres why\n\n1. i think the whole timescale of between the hobbit and lotr fellowship no longer applies. the hiers of numenor and against the shadow seems to have no timescale…i cant remember anything in the cycle pointing to a particular attack, but osgilliath was attacked 20th june…perhaps it is set around then\n\nEDIT ive just seen pack 5 and it mentions boromir in minas tirith….he left soon after the attack on osgilliath in june so maybe this is the timescale (im just guessing here…cant remember if we are ever told differently)\n\n2. if the timescale does still apply however, boromir sets out from minas tirth 4th july, this is in the fellowship book timescale, so if ffg are strictly keeping to the timeline, we wouldnt be able to do it\n\n3.we have never actually had a cycle centered around a main character…..the hunt for gollum cycle did hint to aragorns quest, but he never actually featured. also we alreday have 2 boromirs, im not sure theres room for another (not that there would have to be, it would just make sense)\n\n4.the cycles to me are more open ended than boromirs journey to rivendell, and although the details are there to be filled in by ffg, i still see it as too closed.\n\n \n\ni do think there is a chance youre correct on rohan deluxe\n\ndain was #6 before a dwarf cycle. theoden is #6 and is stated by the writer of the article to be like dain (which of course he is in abiliy)\n\nas for the packs i think perhaps some of sarumans spies in breeland….we could build on the dunedain and hobbits which we are getting in this cycle. its not really related to rohan, though i suppose the spies could be sent into rohan as well as bree, as must have been so. this wuold also place it between the hobbit and the fellowship of the ring.\n\n \n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82692-prediction-rohan-and-boromirs-journey-north/?do=findComment&comment=787279","commentId":787279,"userName":"klaymen_sk","timestamp":1366545041,"content":"richsabre said:\n\ni do think there is a chance youre correct on rohan deluxe\n\ndain was #6 before a dwarf cycle. theoden is #6 and is stated by the writer of the article to be like dain (which of course he is in abiliy)\n\n\n\n \n\nHowever Elrond was #6 as well, yet we got HoN instead of an Elvish cycle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82692-prediction-rohan-and-boromirs-journey-north/?do=findComment&comment=787280","commentId":787280,"userName":"Style75","timestamp":1366545522,"content":"I don't think they'd have any problem using Boromir as the central character.

As horses were as dear to Rohirrims as their family, and Eomund, King's Brother, got killed in Emyn Muil while trying to fight off these thieves, I can see that being Cycle's plot.\n\nSo maybe we will get Delux expansion featuring Boromir's Journey (heroes might be one of the Royal escorts provided from Edoras) that ends in Tharbad, encounter some suspicious Uruk activity that seems to have originated from from Isengard for first half of Cycle but is prevented from investigating any further by Grima Wormtongue, instead are now sent Eastern side of Rohan to chase off what appeared to be common thieves that turned out to be force from Mordor and have a climatic battle where Eomund dies.\n\n \n\nAs for Bree and Eriador, I would like to see them getting their own Cycle, not piggybacking on Rohan Cycle.\nNazgul's attack on Sarn Ford can be used as Delux Expansion or very climatic final battle,\n\nThere are Dunedain Rangers all over Eriador fighting Northern Orcs, remnent of evil men of Carn Dum and Rhudaur, Trolls in Ettenmoors, Wights in Burrow-Downs, and other 'evil stuff', Aragorn did says they were fighting and slaying evil servants of Sauron in the North. Even though Tolkien didin't describe what exactly happened there, I believe FFG can whip up some good scenarios.

Until then, we hope you continue to enjoy all your travels in Middle-earth!\"\n\nI haven't seen any forum speculation about this -- maybe I missed it?  Anyway, the only things that we have gotten since then are the previews for the last 2 APs in Against the Shadow, and the Second Breakfast articles.  Those certainly don't satisfy the quote above, in my opinion.  I think something bigger is coming -- not just any old new deluxe.  Maybe FFG has acquired the rights to develop saga expansions based on the actual trilogy?

Now that we know the next Deluxe Expansion is going to be Rohan and Isenguard, I think my prediction is coming true. Further proof.... the next cycle of AP's is called \"Ring Maker\". Well, who were the ring makers? The elves of Eregion who helped make Sauron's rings of power. Their realm collapsed at the end of the second age and it was through the ruins of their kingdom that Boromir had his greatest adventures while journeying north from Rohan to Rivendell.

He wore a ring on his finger.\" I think the fact that Gandalf notices it, however briefly, means that it wasn't there before and is something new, which goes along with his declaration of being a Ring-maker. We can conclude that Saruman used knowledge gained from his investigations into ring-lore to make a ring sometime during the years before the war. Somehow the cycle will take us from working from Saruman to uncovering Saruman's ring-making.
