Even low will decks can sudenly become powered as you can commmit to a quest even if you have 0 will. Very strong card, but needs some planning to use I think, as his ability requires a rush deck so there is enough units on the field to make his ability really shine.. Still I have won many games of the back of this guy alone.\n\n \n\nAs for Riddermark... meh.. not so into this guy. The problem with this card is that teh effect requires a tap as well as a discard. So unless you are placing the card is usless. It just sits there. You can not even commit it to a quest. It used to be more powerful but 2 quest locations are not as common as they used to be. Also as you said, there is already asfaloth witch is just this effect but a billion times better, + but ti is really Ride to Ruin that makes this card kinda crappy. It places a 3rd token, has the same discard effect, but can trigger of any rohan, even if it is tapped. This card basically repalces Riddermark. The art on it is awesome though for sure. Also if you do run it, you can then run a very under rated card Strength of Will as you are nearly garenteed to have a untapped Spirit charicter at all times."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85832-the-cards-you-are-addicted-to/?do=findComment&comment=808540","commentId":808540,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1373000537,"content":"> nice thread.\n> \n> my addictions are usually based upon theme and art (surprise surprise eh?)\n> \n> so....that said, i cannot.....hardly ever, make a deck with strider in, and not have striders path. that card is lovely. and whats even better is that now thrors map has gotten killed with the errata, its actually worth putting in.\n> \n>  \n> \n> other cards at the moment are rivendell blade, yew bow and black arrow for whenever i have legolas about.\n> \n>  \n> \n> another two cards i constantly come back to are healing herbs and good meal....all the hobbity goodness :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n> \n>  \n> \n> northern tracker and other dunedain cards feature heavily in my decks\n> \n> ...basically anything that make my games have an 'eriador' feel\n> \n> rich\n\n \n\nI just cannot wait for being able to actually build good Eriador themed decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85832-the-cards-you-are-addicted-to/?do=findComment&comment=808585","commentId":808585,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1373017279,"content":"Though I really try to build different decks every time, I usually end up with hands upon the bow (since I usually end up with Legolas who in my opinion is the best hero in the game) and I'm obviously skipping things like feint. Also defender of rammas is a quite stable add to my decks since it came out. Another new card I'm trying a lot is the new silvan refugee. Amazing card. One of my favourite decks is a Legolas, Hama, Glorfindel (FoS) event recycle deck. I used to have horn of gondor+bofur (spirit) but now i took them out, added 3 refugees and a couple more events and the deck just became perfect (I tried many scenarios I had already done with the same deck and I scored much much better). they're just perfect for this deck. Anyway let's say that if I would nominate a leadership card I'm addicted to (except Steward of Gondor and Sneak Attack) it would probably be errand rider (he's a living song capable of chump blocking). Tactics obviously Hands upon the bow (Feint being out of the contest). As for Spirit maybe the West Road Traveller( again with A Test of Will out) and for lore perhaps Risk Some Light (in solo play it's just one of the best card of the game)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85832-the-cards-you-are-addicted-to/?do=findComment&comment=808590","commentId":808590,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1373018086,"content":"it always suprises me how how people like tactics so much.

Resourcful is fantastic and dosn't require a leadersplash. This is great for solo, as a out of sphere splash can require quite a large card commitment in your deck to run smoothly.\n\nStill steward, is in no way a bad card. If you are running solo and a leadership hero there is zero reason not to run it apart form self gimping reasons. Same gose for multiplayer. Among the players SOMEONE will be running leadership, and they should be running steward.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n> i used to place eowyn in this catagory, and i know this subject has been talked to death on, but i feel that she is good, just not that good. in a solo deck she works well, and she works well in a quest support deck...\n\nI agree with this as well. She is training wheels for new players and for solo decks before the card pool got larger. She makes everything easier in the early game, and in that respect she is great, but as the game gose on, her ability gets less and less useful and you end up with many more will than you need though allies. There are SO many heroes that have way way way better power text that affect the game for its entire length and never start to be unneeded.\n\nThe only \"real\" deck she is in that I know of are Stand and Fight decks where you use her ability to discard and then rez with stand and fight. Still now there are cards that let you discard AND do other stuff.. so even this combo is now defunct."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85832-the-cards-you-are-addicted-to/?do=findComment&comment=808617","commentId":808617,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1373027089,"content":"Nice thread ...
