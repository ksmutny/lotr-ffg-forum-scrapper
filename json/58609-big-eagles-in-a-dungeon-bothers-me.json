I guess Journey will still have people playing archer decks. I think this could be a problem with LoTR in general though. While LoTR is fantasy, it is not a wild and crazy as modern fantasy is, meaning I often wounder about how many things they can really add to this game. I mean almost all the races are already represented.

You find a new armor and it ALWAYS fits you perfectly. No matter if you are man or woman, big or small, dwarf or giant, the armor will suit you.

How does it happen that for every peaceful civilian there are at least 1 hundred of villains that you need to kill? And why everyone keeps giving you quests like fetch/kill and I'll pay you my whole monthly salary?\n\nThose are only games, not a real life. Sometimes people forget and then we can read in newspaper about some nerds who try to rob a store using a lightsaber and jedi powers.\n\nEven if there was a list of rules what is allowed and what is not (like eagles in dungeon), the list would be huge and no sane person would like to play the game.

Wounded Gimli should not be able to wear Citadel plate, it is way too heavy for wounded character, on the verge of death. We would need a list of characters able to wield a sword and fight with it (it requires a lot of time to learn and you need to be quite strong). It means a lot of allies and hero's should not be able to do it.
