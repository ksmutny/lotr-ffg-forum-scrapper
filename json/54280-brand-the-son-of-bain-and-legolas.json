When a player declares an attack against enemies engaged with you, that completely negates the whole ranged keyword.

It explains that you can declare the ranged character as an attacker against enemies engaged with another player, OR you can declare them as an attacker when other players declare an attack against enemies engaged with another player.

Since FFG actually took the time to specify the first condition was against enemies engaged with other players, and failed to do so with this condition I argue, no it is not worded in such a way.  I find it is worded such that putting thematic reasoning aside, a ranged character could participate in an attack that is declare by another player, even if that attack is targeting an enemy engaged with the player controlling the ranged character.\n\nIf FFG worded the Ranged section in a manner similar to this, there could be no dispute, and no loop-hole.  \n\n\"A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players. A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks against these targets that are declared by other players. In either case, the character must exhaust and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack.\"\n\nIt is not worded like that, and I see a loop-hole in the way it's worded.  I've sent a question about it to FFG for a rules clarification, because I do want to stick to the rules.  Will they tell me I'm wrong? Probably, but until then I'll stick to my guns because that's how I see it.  Although it could just be that I've got an astigmatism and I'm far-sighted, so I don't see things correctly any way. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]  Who knows?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54280-brand-the-son-of-bain-and-legolas/?do=findComment&comment=539378","commentId":539378,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1318172035,"content":"Well, I've stated it over and over, but one more time... The very first sentence explains it all. The ranged keyword only comes into play on attacks made against enemies engaged with another player. If the attack is not made against an enemy engaged with another player, the ranged keyword never comes into play.\n\nThe part you are referring to is conditional on the definition of a ranged attack. They don't need to specifically state it here (although I suppose they could for the sake of eliminating an argument like this) because it's already defined."}]}
