So I try to commits all of my heroes for willpower points but it's not enough to the Willpower and next turn. The willpower will incaese from encounter deck. \nSo I can't play 1 player to pass the 2nd question from the starter Lord of the ring LCG. with the starter deck.\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124799-many-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1298941","commentId":1298941,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1413274291,"content":"All cards in the staging area count their Threat.

I need more practice about the gaming and I'll build my own deck. I just buy and play it for a fews time and got a location lock. sometimes it's 3 location and it not  enough willpower to progress the active location.\n\nThanks again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124799-many-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1300120","commentId":1300120,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1413357877,"content":"When using just the core set you will notice that only very few cards have a decent amount of Willpower.\n\nI'll make the list for you:\n\n4 - Eowyn\n4 - Gandalf (ally)\n3 - Glorfindel\n2 - Aragorn\n2 - Faramir (ally)\n2 - Gimli\n2 - Gloin\n2 - Brok Ironfist (ally)\n2 - Beravor\n\n \n\nThese are the only ones with more than 1 Willpower, so when choosing your heroes. Allready a lot of the willpower you will get during the game is fixed. But fortunately there are other cards with less willpower who would serve you a great deal regarding willpower, for example\n\n \n\nHeroes:\n\nLegolas\n \n\nAllies:\n\nNorthern Tracker\nLorien Guide\n\n \n\nAttachments:\nCelebrian's Stone\n\nBlade of Gondolin\nProtector of Lorien\n\nFavor of the Lady\n\n \n\nEvents: \n\nStrength of Will\nRadagast's Cunning\nSecret Paths\n\nI chose the most relevant ones (probably not complete). So now the major task for you should be to choose which of these cards you like to include in your deck so you are able to win this scenario. I's suggest to play Aragorn - Theodred - Eowyn, since I think this is the most natural attempt to try it with. But you could also try Glorfindel - Denethor - Legolas. or Aragorn - Eowyn - Legolas .... and so on. I think there are plenty of options to try, and find out which kind of strategy suits you best.\n\nIf you really like the game, you could start to expand your card set, which will make a lot of the earlier scenario's easier because you get more deck options (and better heroes). My way of expanding was as follows:\n\n1. The Black Riders (4 heroes - 3 scenarios)\n\n2. Khazad Dum (2 heroes - 3 scenarios)\n3. Over Hill and Under Hill (4 heroes - 3 scenarios)\n\n4. The Heirs of Numenor (2 heroes - 3 scenarios)\n\n5. a bunch of small expansions\n\n \n\nBut I think if you are looking for some really strong heroes\n\n1. Foundations of Stone\n2. Return to Mirkwood\n3. Shadow and Flames\n....\n\nOr if you just want some really fun (in my opinion)\n\n1. The Dead Marshes\n\n2. Conflict at the Carrock\n\n...\n\nSo far my thoughts,\nHave fun!!\n \n\nEdited October 15, 2014 by Jban"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124799-many-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1301578","commentId":1301578,"userName":"aden2","timestamp":1413447321,"content":">  \n\nEdited October 23, 2014 by ADEN"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124799-many-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1301581","commentId":1301581,"userName":"aden2","timestamp":1413447722,"content":"> When using just the core set you will notice that only very few cards have a decent amount of Willpower.\n> \n> I'll make the list for you:\n> \n> 4 - Eowyn\n> \n> 4 - Gandalf (ally)\n> \n> 3 - Glorfindel\n> \n> 2 - Aragorn\n> \n> 2 - Faramir (ally)\n> \n> 2 - Gimli\n> \n> 2 - Gloin\n> \n> 2 - Brok Ironfist (ally)\n> \n> 2 - Beravor\n> \n>  \n> \n> These are the only ones with more than 1 Willpower, so when choosing your heroes.
