I was freshly married and into moving to new home and at the same time pretty occupied with work mixed up with some other obligations coming my way. \n \n\nToday, I have ordered The Hunt for Gollum A.P. and together with Core Set it is making my current LotR LCG collection. I was wondering for some time what to get next, but since that I haven't actually played the game, it wasn't hard for me to choose. Because my hobby budget is pretty much low, the only two choices where mentioned Adventure Pack or Over Hill and Under Hill Deluxe Expansion. I have read several times a New Player Buying Guide from TftC, and it was clear to me that I have to start from beginning following the release order - just the same way that I did with Warhammer: Invasion LCG. Yeah, I guess I want to have it all with no matter how much time does it takes.\n\nI will probably update my progress with the gameplay in this topic, hoping that I won't have much trouble with it. \n\nFinally, I am going in circles around the box - like cat around the mouse... It is time to go. The Road awaits me.\n\nDedalus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96567-a-humble-beginning/?do=findComment&comment=949901","commentId":949901,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1389281425,"content":"Welcome aboard, Dedalus!

No, not unless you have some way to ready them (i.e. Unexpected Courage). You have to exhaust a character (hero or ally) to quest, defend, or attack. So, usually a character is limited to one action per turn (outside cards that ready heroes/allies).\n\n \n\n2. Of course!
