Instead of customizing the encounter deck for the other team and hoping to hit them unprepared, you can just pick seven random encounter sets and play these quests like any other. Of course with the modular deck, you have many different combinations, some of them are more deadly than others.\n\nEdited May 10, 2019 by Amicus Draconis"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295134-mines-of-moria-gen-con-scenario/?do=findComment&comment=3699616","commentId":3699616,"userName":"cfmcdonald","timestamp":1557521849,"content":"> 2 minutes ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> While these scenarios are designed for competitive play, there are also rules that allow cooperative or solo play.
