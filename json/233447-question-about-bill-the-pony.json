The text does not say while in play or similar, just states that hobbits get an additional hit point.\n\n \n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233447-question-about-bill-the-pony/?do=findComment&comment=2476929","commentId":2476929,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1477570014,"content":"The +1 hitpoints is a constant/passive effect associated with Bill the Pony being in play. (we know its constant/passive since there was no trigger word like Action: or Response:)\n\n \n\nFrom the rules (Advanced Concepts: Constant Effects, page 23):\n\n\"Constant effects continually affect the game state as long as the card is in play and any other specified conditions are met. These effects have no bold trigger, as they are always active.\"\n\n \n\nSo, when he leaves play, so does the effect."}]}
