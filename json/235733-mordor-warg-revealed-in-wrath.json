Limit 1 per enemy (Counts as Mount attachment with the text: \"Attached enemy gets +2 Threat, +2 Attack, +2 Defense, and +2 hit points. Forced: When attached enemy leaves play, add Mordor Warg to the staging area\").\n\n \n\nAssume a player later engages the enemy it attached to and then plays Revealed in Wrath (blanks an enemy card's text box for a phase) on Mordor Warg during the combat phase, what happens to Mordor Warg? Does it immediately detach from the enemy it was attached to, as its text box is now blank? Or does it stay attached to the enemy it attached to since that occurred in staging as a \"When Revealed\" effect. If the former, I assume it then reverts to an enemy engaged with the player that played Revealed in Wrath on it. If the later, and the player who blanked it with RiW then kills the enemy it was attached to, does MW then become an enemy engaged with that player?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/235733-mordor-warg-revealed-in-wrath/?do=findComment&comment=2518522","commentId":2518522,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1480398809,"content":"I don't think you can target the Warg when it's attached to another Enemy, since while it's attached it counts as an Attachment, and not an Enemy."}]}
