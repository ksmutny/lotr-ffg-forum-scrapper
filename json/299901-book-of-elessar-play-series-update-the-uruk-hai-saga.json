Think of it like interactive fanfic, I guess.\n\nFinally, I'm posting my gameplay to YouTube. There are also deck construction and theme pieces for each quest.\n\n \n\nOkay, that's a lot! But, here's the link! I hope some enjoy and read along. I'll post a reply with each update.

You only reshuffle the encounter deck during the Quest Phase! So if the encounter deck runs out during another phase, it remains empty until the quest phase.\n\nIn the Rules Reference on page 15 (emphasis added):\n\n> Quote\n> \n> If the encounter deck is ever out of cards during the quest phase, the encounter deck discard pile is shuffled and reset back into the encounter deck.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299901-book-of-elessar-play-series-update-the-uruk-hai-saga/?do=findComment&comment=3921675","commentId":3921675,"userName":"Bobbymcbobface","timestamp":1585584155,"content":"> 4 minutes ago, manoftomorrow010 said:\n> \n> Nope!\n\nAHHHHHHHHRRRRGGGGGHHHH. ... ... ...
