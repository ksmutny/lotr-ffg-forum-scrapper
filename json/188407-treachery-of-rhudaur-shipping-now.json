The abundance of news, spoilers and new products is amazing and I wish it could always be like this. Alas the drought will inevitably come!\n\n \n\nOther cards that have been spoiled are:\n\n-Galadrim Weaver. After it enters play shuffle the top card of your discard pile into your deck. (this will be very good with the new noldor discard cards that \"gain power based on what the top card of your discard pile is\" that we have not yet seen) \n\n-Reinforcements. Leadership event that costs 3 and requires you to spend resources from three different heroes. No idea what it does but it will obviously have to do with allies I imagine. \n\n-Elven Spear. Tactics attachment costs 0 and attaches to a noldor or silvan. Can discard cards from your hand to give the character +1 attack, limit three times per phase. \n\n-Leadership side quest. We have no indication as to what this will do but I am most excited for this card as I love the neutral and spirit side quests but not so much the tactics or lore ones. I think the leadership one could potentially be amazing.\n\nOne very very simple and to the point effect could be:\n4 quest points. limit one per deck. Response: When this stage is defeated, each player may put an ally card from his hand into play at no cost if able. Not sure if this would be too good though.... Plus the other leadership card reinforcements potentially does something similar so maybe the side quest will ramp resources instead? that is leadership mechanics. We did just get ranger provisions however so probably not..... hmmmmmm!!!!\n\nEdited September 15, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188407-treachery-of-rhudaur-shipping-now/?do=findComment&comment=1795850","commentId":1795850,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1442299964,"content":"Thanks for the summary, PsychoRocka. That's right, the Leadership side quest remains. I hope Erestor comes with an additional card that kickstarts discard pile shenanigans - maybe one of the lore cards?\n\nAs for Scout Ahead, I must disagree. To me, that's the most powerful side quest so far or possibly on par with Gather Information. Even if you don't run a victory display deck, in a solo game Scout Ahead allows you to remove one card and control exactly in which order things are going to show up for the next four rounds so you can quest/prepare accordingly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188407-treachery-of-rhudaur-shipping-now/?do=findComment&comment=1796555","commentId":1796555,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1442330899,"content":"The Door is Closed is in this pack as well, right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188407-treachery-of-rhudaur-shipping-now/?do=findComment&comment=1796579","commentId":1796579,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1442331388,"content":"That's right, according to the product page.

An Erestor deck burns through 50 cards in exactly 11 rounds, an Erestor+Cirdan deck in 9 rounds (and this disregards other effects like Daeron's Runes and Ancient Mathom). The question is whether it will be a good thing for certain cards to stay in the discard pile and a Noldor player should simply build thicker decks, or Will of the West is going to become a key card as cards you couldn't afford the first time round can just shuffle back and show up again.\n\n \n\nI proxied Erestor with Elrond and Glorfindel again yesterday and tried new cards like Elven Jeweller, and it works all right already - but the main problem is that you get 10 cards on round one and have absolutely no way of using them all, particularly if you don't get a Protector of Lorien or something. Now we have a reverse problem - it hurts to throw away A Test of Will and Arwen just because I needed Asfaloth more. Which is why I'm excited about how cards in the discard pile is going to affect play - this is very obviously an archetype-in-progress.\n\nEdited September 16, 2015 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188407-treachery-of-rhudaur-shipping-now/?do=findComment&comment=1798547","commentId":1798547,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1442400126,"content":"Well, I was playing Erestor, Boromir and Glorfindel for a month or so, and on more occasions than not, I used all 10 cards on round 1. Boromir was the key, as I always used a mulligan for Protector of Lórien which I attached to him; then he could quest for 4 and defend for 5. Elven Spear was another great set up card: for Glorfindel, obviously. Elven Jeweller just made things even easier on round 1, but she's actually not that great card otherwise.\n\n \n\nThe deck was strong already, but I think it might get stronger still. The dilemma for me still stands: should I keep the line-up or go for Círdan instead of Boromir (and lose Elven Spear and a great defender) or Glorindel (and start with a high threat, and Elven Spear become quite redundant, and Protector much less useful, too)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188407-treachery-of-rhudaur-shipping-now/?do=findComment&comment=1798747","commentId":1798747,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1442409586,"content":"Erestor+Boromir is interesting, haven't thought of that.

I have tried both that and Fair and Perilous and though I think the latter is a great card, in this particular deck the former was much more effective. I am excited about F&P with Protector of Lórien, it can suddenly boost attack as well.\n\nThe full Noldor line-up (Erestor, Círdan, Glorfindel) seems good but the defense might be a problem. Erestor only has 2-defense. Protector helps, than Cloak can help some more but otherwise you will have to do with chumps.\n\nUnless, of course, they give us more cards for the strategy, and they will but I don't expect much defensive boost within Lore and Spirit."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188407-treachery-of-rhudaur-shipping-now/?do=findComment&comment=1799479","commentId":1799479,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1442428617,"content":"> Yeah, I also thought it could be that.
