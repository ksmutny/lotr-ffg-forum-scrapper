I also like the name of her Tactics event, \"Sterner than Steel.\"\n \nA few observations, with speculation:\nThis is our first fellowship hero without an ability that requires fellowship resources. I wonder if the quests will be a bit more like the Hobbit quests, where encounter cards required Baggins resources. The boon version of Gildor Inglorion, Shifting Quagmire and We Hates Them! (both from The Land of Shadow), and the newly spoiled Overcome by Fear are the only encounter cards so far to use fellowship resources. Of course, Aragorn's resources won't be wasted if he has Celebrian's Stone or Sword that was Broken attached.\n \nOvercome by Fear is a burden, though I imagine it will be possible to avoid it (probably it will only be earned if it's attached at the end of the quest). The flying Nazgul is our first burden enemy, and will almost certainly have surge (0 threat, high engagement). I wonder whether it will be possible to avoid earning that burden. I also wonder whether, if earned, that burden will be included for the Ringbearer quests in the sixth box, or only in the Battle of the Morannon quest.\n \nHow important will hit points be in The Passing of the Grey Company? Into Fangorn had several cards that damaged characters, and the nightmare version had a location that removed the Hinder keyword from enemies. I wonder if we'll see anything like that here.\n \nSince speed is important in The Siege of Gondor, I hope we get a powerful Oathbreakers objective ally.\n \nI wonder whether the Witch-king will interact with the Sorcery trait. \"Forced: When the Witch-king is dealt a shadow card with the Sorcery trait, resolve that card's When Revealed effect\" would be brutal.\n \n\n> Still, we don't get to defend the walls of Minas Tirith?\n\n \n\nThere are so many great moments in the story. I like how campaign mode follows the Ringbearer and Aragorn, while sneaking in elements of other stories (like Rouse the Ents, stage 1 of The Road to Isengard). I imagine that the beginning of The Battle of Pelennor Fields will involve Grond and defending Minas Tirith, especially since Spells of Ruin mentions damage on Minas Tirith. I like Aragorn's delayed entry into the battle (using our first double-sided card that's part of two different encounter sets!), and I imagine his arrival will be significant: perhaps he needs to be in play to advance to the next stage, or perhaps spending Fellowship resources helps to make things less difficult.\n\n \n\n> the expansion's new heroes and player cards represent the strength of the alliance between the Men of Gondor, the Riders of Rohan, and the Elves and Dúnedain of the Grey Company. Nearly all the new player cards bear either the Gondor, Rohan, or Dúnedain traits...\n>  \n> ...you'll find new boons that allow you to swear your fealty to either Gondor or Rohan\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nThe focus on Rohan and Gondor means that the second hero is probably Gondor. Leadership Denethor and Spirit Imrahil are reasonable possibilities (though Denethor feels strange, especially since there isn't a siege of Gondor quest that focuses on Minas Tirith). Other options include Beregond (perhaps Leadership), Hurin the Tall or Forlong (both of whom rode out with Imrahil and Hirluin to help Eomer), or perhaps even Duinhir, lord of Morthond. Ally Halbarad seems very likely, and ally Merry and Pippin are almost certainly excluded (perhaps delayed to the last box). Eomer is important, so unless we get hero Eomer in the last box or two Rohan heroes in this box, ally Eomer seems likely.\n \nI was hoping for the banner that Arwen made for Aragorn (with the emblems of Elendil) as a boon, but that seems unlikely now (though perhaps it could be the boon that allows you to swear fealty to Gondor). Maybe we'll get it as a player card instead.\n \nFinally, the announcement article for The Land of Shadow was April 30, 2015, and it was at Gen Con last year. While there's no guarantee, a tentative Q3 release date (July to September) means there's a good chance The Flame of the West will be at Gen Con this year.\nEdited April 27, 2016 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218379-flame-of-the-west-new-saga/?do=findComment&comment=2188195","commentId":2188195,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1461723746,"content":"> So glad they decided to just go with Tactics hero Eowyn with 4 willpower and all.

Éomer surely plays a larger role within these chapters than any other candidate, except for Denethor (I am not considering characters who we got in previous saga: Théoden, Faramir, Merry, Pippin). Now, if they have made Éowyn, perhaps they will go for Denethor as well. And then, we might get Éomer in the last box?\n\n \n\nSaving Éomer for the last box and having Denethor as the other hero would make Imrahil, Beregond, Merry, Pippin easy choices for allies.

We already have two ally versions and a hero version all of which see LOTS of play and are all powerful. Not only do I think a fourth version is completely unnecessary but it would only further mess with multiplayer (which version does the entire group want to agree on for example) and would make it harder deciding which version you will use.\n\nAlso the hero is stupidly powerful, has more toys than any other hero and is neutral so can slot into so many lineups and decks.\n\nfurthermore Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White are the same person.. yes he dies and comes back but it is the same individual in the end so why can't the hero we already have represent both versions?\n\nDon't get me wrong I totally see where you are coming from and yes he is an integral character but we have 3 versions of Gandalf already as well as the boon Beyond all Hope. I feel like the vast majority of characters deserve a second or even third version way before Gandalf does.\n\nSorry to be harsh but I really don't think we need or will see a version of Gandalf that is specifically Gandalf the White. I'm pretty sure we would already have him (in Treason of Saruman) if FFG were going to make him.\n\nI love that there are so many others that want new versions of the twins... really really hope we get them....\n\nEdited April 27, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218379-flame-of-the-west-new-saga/?do=findComment&comment=2188926","commentId":2188926,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1461766415,"content":"> > Glaurung!

Denethor, Beregond, and Imrahil are the most likely candidates. Of them, Imrahil plays the largest role in the battle of Pelennor Fields, so my guess is that we'll get a Spirit Imrahil hero. If that's the case, then we'll probably get a Spirit Gondor ally and a Tactics Rohan ally (just like Treabeard got Quickbeam to accompany him, Theoden got Háma, and Faramir and Damrod got Anborn and Mablung).

I think since story-wise, the Battle of the Morannon and the destruction of the One Ring by the Ring-bearer have to happen concurrently, there will be one quest involving both. We already have The Breaking of the Fellowship, in which one player controls Frodo for the duration of the quest. Or one of the Hobbit quests where Bilbo is off by himself answering riddles.

Normally I wouldn't care about a box, but with all the BS surrounding the controversial decision from Asmode (and therefore FFG) to curb online sales, increasing prices across the board for everyone, I'm annoyed they're cutting corners. They want to label themselves as a luxury brand, not some generic store brand product. Cool, I get that. But why am I paying more than before and getting less? You can't just cut corners and charge a premium price. That's like a luxury car manufacturer slapping on their hood ornaments on cheap used cars they acquired and charging you the full premium price."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218379-flame-of-the-west-new-saga/?do=findComment&comment=2194839","commentId":2194839,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1462070206,"content":"I don't know the decision making, but it really smacked of Asmodee to me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218379-flame-of-the-west-new-saga/?do=findComment&comment=2195478","commentId":2195478,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1462126597,"content":"> Cards are the same.

If I have, this is manageable.  If I haven't, it will be nigh impossible.  Pelennor is most definitely the best stand alone scenario in the box, but Passing of the Grey Company will probably get the most play from me.  It's fun, it's thematic and just different enough to feel fresh."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218379-flame-of-the-west-new-saga/?do=findComment&comment=2358116","commentId":2358116,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1470858994,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > ***SPOILER ALERT*****I received my copy yesterday... and the first quest, after the first planning phase, makes you discard your hand!!

The problem is, since there is no ring-bearer in play during the game (Aragorn has not the ring bearer trait), you will never been able to play the card.

I just had to crow about a win I just had against Siege of Gondor.\n\nThe only wins I've had against this quest involved balls-to-the-wall willpower decks, but for some reason I decided to take a Silvan/Noldor fellowship of two decks against it instead. Moreover, the Silvan deck was Celeborn-Legolas-Argalad, which meant that it was not a heavy quester (compared to Silvan decks that use Galadriel, at least).\n\nI'm not sure I've ever been so doubly lucky and unlucky in a game. Unlucky because it took me forever to find certain cards, like Elven-light and O Lorien (which actually sits in the heavily-drawing Noldor deck, which moreover has 3x Rivendell Minstrel, so it was shocking it took so long). When I finally played O Lorien, it was just a round or two before a shadow effect discarded it, ugh. Meanwhile, the Tactics Silvan deck couldn't find a weapon for the life of it, so its intended Straight Shot abuse was entirely for naught: 3x Straight Shot sat in my hand nearly all game. And Silvan Tracker, who could've been so excellent with all the direct damage in the quest, never hit the table either.\n\nAt the same time, the roulette spin that Silvans can be hit money over and over and over. Do I need to Tree People into a Galadhrim Minstrel into a Feigned Voices in order to survive...? Sure, that can happen. Will the usually least-useful Silvan event, Pursuing the Enemy, repeatedly get me the last damage I need to avoid deadly attacks? Yup! I need to draw into a Galadhrim Healer RIGHT NOW. Oh, there she is.\n\nIn the end, with 11 (!) damage on the Corsair Fleet, I YOLO quested with everyone except Legolas and found myself... two short. Four undefended attacks and four dead heroes later, Legolas -- good ol' Core set Legolas, not a single attachment on him -- fired off a single Ranged arrow at an 8HP Umbar Pirate Crew who'd been slowly but surely softened up by repeated Argalad'ings and a Gandalf bomb... It plinked for that last point of needed damage to destroy it, and Legolas calmly put the last two progress on the quest for the win. What a boss.\n\nI've never felt so simultaneously undeserving and deserving of a win. Good thing this wasn't in campaign mode!\n\n(Also: Dunedain Remedy is good, yo. I only had it for a couple of rounds before it too was discarded to a shadow effect, but in those two rounds, it healed a ridiculous amount of damage.)\n\nEdited September 15, 2016 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218379-flame-of-the-west-new-saga/?do=findComment&comment=2414912","commentId":2414912,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1473908848,"content":"Nice write-up, sounds like an awesome game.  I like the Dunedain Remedy card very much, although I haven't played with it yet.  Is that the first healing card that isn't Lore?

This is the box that made me realize Campaign Mode will for the most part only be playable for power decks, which is kind of a bummer.
