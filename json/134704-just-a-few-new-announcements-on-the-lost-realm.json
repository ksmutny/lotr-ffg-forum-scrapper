Honestly this and Treason of Saruman can not arrive fast enough, almost drooling over both at this point. Probably going to proxy Secret Vigil AND Tireless Hunters and try them out tonight. Tireless Hunters is PERFECT for two handed players like me for when that one annoying enemy slips through and engages the wrong deck and you don't have sentinel set up on your uber defender yet. Simply slam Tireless Hunters down and that one enemy that slipped through will instead engage the combat deck and lose its shadow card too. \n\nSecret Vigil is EXACTLY the kind of card I've been waiting for to add to my tactics/leadership deck. Gandalf or Galahadrim's Greeting (in my other deck that pairs with the tactics/leadership one) is the only way to lower threat normally and half the time you use Gandalf one of his other abilities would be just as useful as threat reduction. It also reduces all players threat not just the combat deck/player that kills the enemy which is pretty sweet. The minus 1 threat is just bonus, to be completely honest I think it would be a little cooler and more useful if it instead gave -1 attack instead of -1 threat. I think Haldir will probably combo well with this card as you can attach it to a high threat, high engagement enemy in staging reducing its threat (and thereby making it more bearable to leave in staging) and you can then snipe it with a buffed up Haldir's ability and reduce each players threat whilst doing so! Pretty potent combo if you can get it to work. Any direct damage effects like Gandalf, Galadhon Archer, Rumil or even goblin cleaver would also work really well with it as you can essentially put Secret Vigil on an enemy during the planning phase, then use a direct damage effect to instantly destroy said enemy, both removing its threat from the staging area (or stopping it from making an attack against a player that turn if already engaged) AND reducing your threat. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134704-just-a-few-new-announcements-on-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1445992","commentId":1445992,"userName":"Eldainorn","timestamp":1423730691,"content":"Woot!

It is a greater threat reduction the Greeting, but it is a bit more conditional. Greeting can always buy some time for a player at 49. This requires some planning to do so. If a shadow card increases threat to 49, that player can't be saved with this, but they can be saved with Greeting. In addition, it requires an enemy to be out, not exactly rare, but in some scenarios isn't guaranteed either. Further, that enemy must be a good choice, meaning it has to allow attachments and be engageable/killable. These trade offs lead to a potentially bigger threat reduction. Pretty neatly balanced to my eyes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134704-just-a-few-new-announcements-on-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1446606","commentId":1446606,"userName":"blinky","timestamp":1423769260,"content":"Secret Vigil is what Power in the Earth should have been."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134704-just-a-few-new-announcements-on-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1446622","commentId":1446622,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1423769831,"content":"Woohoo!  Lost Realm and Treason of Saruman are on the boat!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134704-just-a-few-new-announcements-on-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1446631","commentId":1446631,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1423770081,"content":"THE TIME APPROACHES!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134704-just-a-few-new-announcements-on-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1446694","commentId":1446694,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1423772123,"content":"Both these tactics cards are great.\n\n \n\nBut man!

Yes, you have to sustain additional costs, but it's still very good for a sphere that was not supposed to get threat reduction at all, until now.\n\nI see an analogy with Ancient Mathom, which is a very good card providing an ability that its sphere would otherwise completely lack: in this case I think balance is achieved through making it the only (non-hero) card providing that ability for Spirit.\n\n \n\nIn the end, I trust the ability of the design team so I think it will end up being balanced."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134704-just-a-few-new-announcements-on-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1456280","commentId":1456280,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1424389258,"content":"Maybe, only one card about reduction threat in one sphere is like a card that can only 1 copy go inside a deck. You cant hope decrease threat effects as a plan, if you don't want to depend of a lot of lucky. So this card is occasional.

Having each sphere have some form of thematically congruent card draw, resource gen, location management, etc provides variety for deck builds and playstyles. Of course, having each sphere maintain its specialty is important too. Otherwise everything gets diluted and same-y.\n\nA difficult line to walk for sure."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134704-just-a-few-new-announcements-on-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1456476","commentId":1456476,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1424394686,"content":"I wouldn't like all spheres to be good at all things equally... but lets face it, till quite recently Tactics lagged a long way behind the other spheres in terms of soloing.

But they shouldn't have a monopoly, they just get to do that easiest and get more cards for that specialization. Spirit is best at threat reduction. It has many ways to do so and it usually as easy as playing the card and go. Tactics having some threat reduction is a good thing even if they have to work for it (playing the attachment then killing the enemy).\n\n \n\nIf Tactics can't have threat reduction I don't think Spirit should have a hero with an attack higher than 2, or ways to do direct damage (Ride Them Down). Stick to roads guys in blue, only tactics can smash face. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134704-just-a-few-new-announcements-on-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1456607","commentId":1456607,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1424400556,"content":"As a solo player, I agree that all spheres should be able to do a little bit of everything, even if some things they can do very rarely and not as efficiently, if only so that they can be played mono-sphere in solo.
