I am playing Assault on Osgiliath solo, and on the first round, I drew The Power of Mordor during the staging phase, which reads : \"When Revealed: Count the number of encounter cards in the staging area and shuffle them into the encounter deck. Reveal an equal number of cards from the encounter deck and add them to the staging area. This effect cannot be canceled.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nThat effect removed all the Osgiliath locations from play.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn the quest card, it is written : \"If the players control all Osgiliath locations in play at the end of the round, they have won the game.\" Does that mean that I have won the game, because there is no Osgiliath locations in play at all? Thanks!\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228224-assault-on-osgiliath-and-the-power-of-mordor-treachery-card/?do=findComment&comment=2378706","commentId":2378706,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1471880402,"content":"Yep, you just won.... and restart agin!\n\nI think that Warden of Arnor made an intesresting youtube video about this!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228224-assault-on-osgiliath-and-the-power-of-mordor-treachery-card/?do=findComment&comment=2379141","commentId":2379141,"userName":"Benoit Poulin","timestamp":1471892077,"content":"Strange victory!

The feel of the quest is quite fun though - even if the mechanics is not the funniest to engage in that game, the whole ambience and vibe about the parts of the cities, roaming orcs and hamrad phallanxes... Haven't played Blood of Gondor nor Morgul Vale yet, but for me, this scenario is like The Hills of Emyn Muil or The Long Dark : mot memorable from the mechanics point of view, but there is something about the scenery that's doing it for me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228224-assault-on-osgiliath-and-the-power-of-mordor-treachery-card/?do=findComment&comment=2379659","commentId":2379659,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1471907180,"content":">  \n> \n> > That particular quest is pretty much not worth playing solo unless you get the Nightmare deck.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Yes, it is random in such a peculiar way.

All is fixed in the Nightmare version, though, if I recall. Hills of Emyn Muil is much better in Nightmare as well, actually. I'm glad that they go back over these quests after a year or so so that even the ones that fall flat still have a chance to become fun quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228224-assault-on-osgiliath-and-the-power-of-mordor-treachery-card/?do=findComment&comment=2380812","commentId":2380812,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1471974304,"content":"> It's really strange that it made it through playtesting, to be honest.\n\nhttps://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/8/9/retake-osgiliath/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/8/9/retake-osgiliath/]\n\nIt seems they only playtested 12 player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228224-assault-on-osgiliath-and-the-power-of-mordor-treachery-card/?do=findComment&comment=2381951","commentId":2381951,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1472020124,"content":"If I remember correctly, it is the same for The Siege of Cair Andros.
