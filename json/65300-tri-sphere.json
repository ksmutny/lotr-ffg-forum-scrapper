They give you a lot more opportunity to fill out a theme/strategy and are more well rounded. You definitely have to be careful about including high cost cards, but resource acceleration is often needed anyway to support those cards (which you can target to the needed sphere - Ziggy is GREAT for this)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65300-tri-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=638171","commentId":638171,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1338402670,"content":" I still think you should just try replacing Eowyn with Thalin and see what happens.\n\nBut I've been thinking about it and there was one tri-sphere deck I made without Leadership.

I would say though Courage is a waste in such a deck, surely you won't place it on a Hobbit when you've got Fast Hitch and placing it on Boromir is redundant - it is much better to spend 1 resource more (or less with Good Meal) to have the effect 6! times."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65300-tri-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=638351","commentId":638351,"userName":"Serazu","timestamp":1338439872,"content":"I think the best approach is to play dual-sphere and, if you want to add a splash of a third sphere, do just that: add a splash and no more. The deck I use is comprised of Spirit and Lore to a 2:1 ratio and a splash of Leadership - just 6 cards, two copies each of Faramir, Sneak Attack and Steward of Gondor. I use 2 Rivendell Minstrels and 3 Songs of Kings to get there. To put it short: if you really want to go the 3-color sphere tactic, try and include Lore as one of your two main spheres and use Leadership as the \"bonus\" one. It runs really smoothly. And, conveniently enough, all you need is just one AP: The Hunt for Gollum. It includes everything for the above combination."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65300-tri-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=638353","commentId":638353,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1338440290,"content":"gvaughn1 said:\n\nMy concern about tri-sphere decks is that it is difficult (I assume) to play high-cost cards from your hand.  If I want to play Elfhelm or Citadel Plate - that is four turns of saving resources for one hero.  Another option that may help is songs, but then I don't want to ramp my card count way up by including a bunch of songs.\n\n \n\n \n\nNot ture… Tri-Sphere is really easy to run now days. Though since the inclusion of the Songs and Minstrels it is more common run splashes… say 2x Lore and 1 other hero and then splash into the other spheres (4 is easy as well btw).. as running say 3 songs + 3 Minstrels is a 6 card chance to draw your needed splash colors. Running 2 Lore means you can get minstrel out on turn 2 if needed.\n\nTactics used to be a hell of a sphere to try solo, but after the Eagles of Misty Mountains and stuff it is now extremely strong so trying to use it for solo shouldn't put you off. It used to be terrible, but now isn't but many of the old players form the Core days have not really given it another look at so say it is bad.. it is not any more."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65300-tri-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=638354","commentId":638354,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1338440315,"content":"Serazu said:\n\n \n\nI think the best approach is to play dual-sphere and, if you want to add a splash of a third sphere, do just that: add a splash and no more.\n\n \n\n \n\ni agree on this- i do this especially when not fielding spirit so i can put in the test of wills hasty strokes UC and the like"}]}
