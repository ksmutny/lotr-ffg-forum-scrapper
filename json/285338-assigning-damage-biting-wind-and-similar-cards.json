Each damage must actually be assigned so as to have an effect on the game. If it helps mentally, treat damage as assigned point by point; calculating hit points and if anything is destroyed before continuing placement.\n\nThe same rule does not apply to enemy attacks, though. If a character is killed by an enemy that has more attack strength than the defender;s combined health and defense, the overspill damage goes wasted. This is good strategy with allies like Snowbourn Scout."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285338-assigning-damage-biting-wind-and-similar-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3518714","commentId":3518714,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1540862537,"content":"The reference ruling for this goes back to at least 2013: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/13452505#13452505 [https://boardgamegeek.com/article/13452505#13452505]\n\nIt is odd that neither the FAQ nor the relatively recent Rules Reference has ever directly addressed this, so far as I can tell."}]}
