They fit the LorR LCG cards just fine. Just make sure you adhere to the cards' dimensions (63x88mm).

And more importantly, they're:\n\n- more likely to slide over when stacked.\n\n- harder to see under lighting.\n\nMatte sleeves are easier to see the card, less likely to slide around, and using the \"cut-and-mash\" technique can be shuffle perfectly well.\n\nHowever, that's just my opinion. I use Ultimate Guard Supreme (matte on both sides) for my LOTR cards, but I like the cards from Arcane Tinmen too - they do Dragon Shield, but I use their mini sleeves for Mansions of Madness.\n\nEdited October 26, 2018 by icabod"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285164-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=3516443","commentId":3516443,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1540644072,"content":"I  always use the Ultra-Pro penny sleeves, the cheapest.
