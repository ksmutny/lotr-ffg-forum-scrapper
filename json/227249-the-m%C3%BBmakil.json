I have to say that I do somewhat agree with others saying this quest seems silly and/or forced. It also definitely gives that fan service feel... \"whats that? you guys always wanted to ride a Mumakil but couldn't? Well now you can!\". I'm going to withhold final judgement however as the tales throughout the cycles and deluxe boxes have been really great and stick to the lore pretty perfectly (especially in the last few cycles) so maybe taming and riding some Mumakil makes sense for the storyline of this cycle. Still seems pretty cheesy though...\n\nAlso not sure I agree that this Harad ally is such a great thing either to be honest. That is for one reason; that she seems to intimate there will be not just a few Harad allies but potentially a whole ton of them. Do we really want them to almost be a faction of there own? At this point there is no doubt in my mind that we will get at least one Harad hero in this cycle considering we will soon receive a Corsair hero (and we don't have ANY corsair allies but we will be getting Harad allies..) in the current one. I am totally happy to receive a few special Harad allies but if we get too many and then Harad heroes it will become its own faction which to me is really weird. I get that Harad is only under Sauron's sway because of fear and whatnot and that many of its people are not that different from other free people of middle earth but to be able to play a \"Harad Deck\" just seems so weird and wrong to me.. Really hope that we only see like 3 or 4 special Harad allies we can include in our decks rather than a whole ton of them. Not that I play only thematic decks or anything but for those who do the only thematic way of using them I can think of is in a Gondor deck by picturing them as refugees/turncoats from Harad that want to oppose the Dark Lord. \n\nThe other player cards are more exciting to me and I love that we will be seeing plenty of cards that reward us for playing with multiple traits. Really hoping we get some strong Dunedain + Noldor cards and that they don't just skip that trait combo because they already gave us Tale of Tinuviel...... that would suck so hard....\nAlso really hope we get some cards that require different traits from the same race such as Gondor + Rohan and to me personally much more importantly Silvan + Noldor. \n\nConey in a Trap is a nice Lore verison of Feint that requires a ranger and warrior character. I wonder if any other of these trait oriented cards we get are slightly different versions of existing cards/effects in other spheres that also require characters of various traits so that the \"sphere bleed\" is not as heavy. \n\nAlso we get this snippet: \"Additionally, there are several player cards that become more powerful when you complete side quests, including an exciting new Ranger hero! But we can get to that later…\"\nSo it seems as though not only will we get various player cards that become more powerful when you complete side quests (there is one in the victory display) but we will also get a hero that is somewhat based on side quests/completing side quests.\n\nI am really excited about all this love for side quests as I am a big fan of player side quests and have included Gather Information and Send for Aid in my decks since they were released. I really like the design of the previous side quest we saw that allows players to pay for their first ally each turn with any resources and this newly revealed one that gives engaged enemies -1 attack that both only benefit you once they are in the victory display but I am more excited to see player cards that power up once a side quest is in the victory display as they will work well with old side quests like Gather Information and Send for Aid as well as the new ones. \n\nOverall I think that we are going to get AMAZING player cards with some great mechanics and abilities as well as some really interesting and different quests. Alongside the whole theme of being stuck in a foreign land trying to get back to Gondor I think that the theme will be discovering that many of the peoples of Harad are actually against the Dark Lord and that it is almost like a nation enslaved by fear and deceit (hence harad allies and whatnot). I imagine there will be a full on desert quest with those wereworms and some sort of temple or ruin quest in the desert in which we enter ancient underground ruins.\n\nSomething that would be really neat for fans of the blue wizards would be a quest in which we discover the cult/following that they tried to lead against the Dark Lord and have to help them escape their own lands or alternatively help them find some hidden desert base they can live in and recruit more followers to. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227249-the-m%C3%BBmakil/?do=findComment&comment=2356504","commentId":2356504,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1470790413,"content":"So has anybody else noticed that the article says it will be out Q4 2016?

Altogether, it is a bit worse than Feint, right? Because you can only prevent the enemy from attacking on the round it engages you. I cannot think of any advantages it has over Feint. So, even though it is still nice to have such a card in Lore, I would think with the requirement (and it is not very common to have both a ranger and warrior in a deck -- though not quite rare, either), the card could have cost 0, because I think most of the decks that do have a warrior and ranger might feature Tactics and thus have access to Feint. What do others think?\n\nit's also limited to 'you' whereas Feint can target anything, but i would say that since it's Lore, you can't really compare them directly, but also a christmas deck could run both and have even more options for preventing enemy attacks\n\nas for the cost, i think it's fine. 0 cost would make it too powerful imo, and sure, not many decks have those characters, but these cards are trying to encourage that exploration."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227249-the-m%C3%BBmakil/?do=findComment&comment=2380608","commentId":2380608,"userName":"manoftomorrow010","timestamp":1471966610,"content":"When I get access to the cards I'm actually very interested in making a \"Trap\" deck and it looks like Coney in the Trap would be a great card to have."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227249-the-m%C3%BBmakil/?do=findComment&comment=2380617","commentId":2380617,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1471967037,"content":"> Lol, I thought they looked a bit goofy just standing there on top of a house.

Couldn't agree more with those saying the art on Coney in a Trap is awful but I actually dislike the art on Wait No Longer even more for some reason. I can see that it definitely has great potential but I feel like the awful art is contributing strongly to my disinterest in this card.\nAlso correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it sort of just a tactics version of Gildor's Counsel that costs one less, fetches an enemy and can be utizilised in Solo? Considering I never play solo and strictly play two handed I'd much rather pay a single extra lore resource to face one card less during staging without having to fetch an enemy and putting it into play engaged with me. Then again there is the whole gaining of resources and various other effects (questing free, discount allies) when enemies engage/are engaged in the Dunedain trait etc. I guess it could be great in Dunedain or engagement decks but yeah idk it just doesn't jump out at me. The only player card I do find somewhat exciting is the new side quest but everyone seems to think it is rather average. I totally see that point of view and agree somewhat but if you do get lucky enough to draw and clear it within the first few turns it could potentially be really powerful especially with the upcoming Thurindir who guarantees you can have it in your starting hand if you wish).\n\nSorry for being so negative just not the most exciting pack for me.

Not only does it allow you greater control over the card type of the top card in your discard pile (so the noldor allies from The Grey Havens can get their respective boosts when you need them), it also allows you to recur Hidden Cache. You need a way to mine down to the bottom of your deck, or a way to shuffle your deck, both of which are pretty easy to do with the current card pool. When you only have two copies of hidden cache and a copy of Lords of the Eldar in your deck, you basically win. :-)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227249-the-m%C3%BBmakil/?do=findComment&comment=2625517","commentId":2625517,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1486222138,"content":"Curious quest.
