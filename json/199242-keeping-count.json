It is irrelevant to the question \"does 'another copy' include more than one copy?\"\n\nIf they wanted it to count all resource tokens on all copies they would have just said \"other copies\". The reason it still wouldn't add 7 attack is because it says \"that is above\". Nothing in the card text says you sum all the resource tokens of all copies before determining how many resource tokens there are. So you would still just Vet +4 and then +2 but it doesn't say 'other copies'.\n\nAlso, if you replaced 'another' with 'one more' which is the standard definition of another, would you still be making your argument?\n\nEdited January 16, 2016 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199242-keeping-count/?do=findComment&comment=1994575","commentId":1994575,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1452953494,"content":"The argument that \"if they wanted you to do x, they would have said y\" doesn't hold water because there is a better way to say every interpretation of the rule that has been discussed so far.
