Advanced Warning: in what way is the card useful? It only prevents engagement checks into the end of phase, so they still will engage just but just at end. Am I interpretng this correctly ?\n\n2. Fresh Tracks: it says enemies added to the staging area, but does that include enemies revealed during staging? I have played it as such but would like confirmation.\n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108049-advanced-warning-and-fresh-tracks/?do=findComment&comment=1110503","commentId":1110503,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1402008974,"content":"1. ?
