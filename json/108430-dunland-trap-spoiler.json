The horse's armaments are quite different, and I think that matters a lot more. Is there any description of what Firefoot looks like in the book?\n\n \n\nIn any case, I'm getting more and more excited to try Eomer. It's taking me a while to loosen my grip on Legolas.\n\n \n\nThis card can be pretty interesting because you can use him to attack a weak enemy to lead to a lot of excess damage, which is then applied to the second enemy as direct damage, so we can skirt around the high defense of some enemies this way. Granted, I have no idea what kinda chances there are to set up this kind of combo.\n\n \n\nAs for being name-specific, I agree that it's sad that it is so focused on Eomer, but there are plenty of ways to grant a lot of attack damage to other characters, so the fact that the additional attack damage is the only thing that specifically applies to Eomer is a good thing.\n\n \n\nIn my mind mounts shouldn't count as restricted attachments. I tend to remove any \"restricted\" from all mounts and add \"A character may only have one mount attachment\" because that's honestly more representative of the truth. A character should be able to have armor, a weapon, and a horse, but not be able to have 2 horses. Sadly this means I can't be awesome and have Rohan Warhorse and Firefoot on the same character, but I'll deal with it. This is probably the one house rule that I feel should be an official rule.\n\n \n\nWith that rule, that means I could load up a Dunhere with 2 Spears of the Mark and Firefoot to destroy enemies in the staging area and apply the excess to someone I'm engaged with. Sadly, Firefoot's excess damage effect will only target enemies I'm engaged with, but if I can keep him in a low-threat deck and optionally engage one of the characters, it shouldn't be too difficult."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108430-dunland-trap-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1116742","commentId":1116742,"userName":"-nebur-","timestamp":1402506462,"content":"Cool...although Eomer is the best Hero to attach this, it can also be good on other heroes (Gimli, Bard).\n\nBetter thought-out than Asfaloth."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108430-dunland-trap-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1116747","commentId":1116747,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1402506853,"content":"Great card, and ok, it is fantastic with Eomer, but other tactics hero would benefit too"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108430-dunland-trap-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1116754","commentId":1116754,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1402507356,"content":"I love name-specific cards.

Chumps do work well with Éomer, though. What seems to be a great card for Éomer and Firefoot is Quick Strike. You can kill two enemies without them having a chance to strike first.

Since I first saw the card this morning I have been thinking of whether or not to proxy it and put it in my tactics/leadership deck to try out on Legolas.\n\nI really think they messed up by making it restricted..... its a horse... you can still use two weapons, have armour etc while riding a horse.\n\n \n\nThe most I could hope for on Legolas would be rivendell blade and firefoot or a dagger of westernesse and firefoot. Either way he has either 4 attack (and negates 2 defense) or 5/6 attack which will only just kill smaller enemies..... unless its an enemy with no armour and only 3 or 4 health he is pretty much never going to spill damage onto a second enemy... even when he does it'll be one or two damage tops.\n\nThe only situation I can see this useful in is quests with lots of goblins who have no armour/only 1 or 2 armour and 3 or less health.\n\n \n\nSimilarly with Dunhere with a spear of the mark and firefoot he has 5 attack, even less than Legolas....\n\n \n\nUnless you run Dunedain Marks or Support of the Eagles I really don't think this card works very well at all with heroes other than Eomer. Eomer has 5 attack with just this card attached.... 6/7 attack with dagger attached as well which would jump to 8/9 when a character leaves play.

Gimli requires to be severely wounded(probably with a citadel plate slapped across his face, though he won't be able to have two of these with da horse) to perform well, Dunhere will need to strike into the staging area(for his passive and bonus from spear), meaning you'll have to have an engaged an unengaed enemy both in the same time, Bard will need a distant enemy, meaning multiplayer or yew bow(unlikely).

While I can understand the argument that named attachments limit deck building options, I enjoy them because they further flesh out certain heroes and give you a reason to use them over any others. In that way, they actually enhance deck building. With Firefoot around, players have more incentive to use Eomer, rather than whatever Tactics hero they normally prefer. Now, if this was overdone, then it would be a problem, but the number of attachments that are like this is actually quite small. \n\n \n\nIn terms of gameplay, trying to determine whether a card like Dunedain Mark or Firefoot is better is difficult because you can't really make general conclusions that apply to all cases. It really depends on the deck. While Mark is the superior choice for some decks, I would definitely take Firefoot for an Eomer deck for a few reasons, even if I never used the trampling ability:\n\n \n\n- +2 attack bonus for Rohan.

They can only be judged in how they interact with other cards. Comparing Mark to Firefoot makes is not really possible. Sure you can compare the face value of the card, but this has no real relation to the strength of the card once it is included in a deck that replies on the card for synergy.\n\n \n\nMark dose add attack to heroes a lot easier (lets just ignore resource requirements) but that is all it dose. It is not a card that synergies easily. The ability to bounce it around between heroes is nice.. but in general, most cases people would cast it and then it stays on that hero. So if you are looking at Firefoot's face value of adding 1attk, then yes it is weaker. Firefoot on the other hand has a synergistic effect. This means the cards true value is unknown until we see the decks that take advantage of that effect. So there is no way to really judge how powerful it will be. There has already been a few decks discussed that I feel are very promising as a powerful monster control hand. Something Mark can NOT do.\n\n \n\nIs one better than the other? Well.. they are just different.\n\n \n\nAnd yes, we would all like to have it with less restrictions, but the deep truth is that restrictions is what forces deck building (as raven kinda said). It is restrictions on cards that makes deck building interesting and fun and innovative.\n\n \n\nThe discussion seams to be, beyond the lame: is it powerful or not, to be about if such restrictions retard deck building options and it doesn't. In fact it increases deck building options by creating cards that only work with other parts of the sets. So as a deck builder you need to make a choice on what cards you use and this forces deck builds.. deck diversity.\n\n \n\nIf this was just all about cards being more powerful than the last released, what you get is power creep. One card replacing the orther and going into all decks.. every deck having the same card.

The \"d\" is from \"and\". Also, \"ally card\" still isn't long enough to get the alignment correct.\n\n \n\n> I agree with Scott that the last letter is a \"d\" and \"ally card\" fits the space better.  As far as being more useful that Master, Master can use his ability every round where Galadhrim Minstel's ability is an etb.\n\n \n\nI didn't say she was more useful. I just said that she's different enough that I'm ok with the similar ability. Besides, usefulness is dependent on what you want to use them for. If you find questing/combat more useful than searching for more attachments, then GM is more useful. Many times I've found that adding a ton of allies that have \"exhaust to x...\" cards gives me an army of allies that aren't useful for the core actions of the game. While having an Imladris Stargazer, Gleowine, and Master of the Forge all out can be pretty awesome, they might as well be attachments because their stats are pretty weak and don't contribute much after that.\n\n \n\nI'm absolutely not saying they're bad cards! I'm just saying that your priorities are what you use to compare GM to MotF. Also, in Silvan decks, there are plenty of ways to pop her in and out of play, which should give you plenty of ways to use her ability multiple times."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108430-dunland-trap-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1124327","commentId":1124327,"userName":"-nebur-","timestamp":1403029438,"content":"After thinking more about this card, i came to this:\n\n \n\nResponse: After Galadhrim Minstel enters\n\nplay, search the top 5 cards of your deck for an\n\nevent card and add it to your hand.

Also, judging by my mockup comparisons, it actually lines up more accurately. (I spent a good chunk of time this morning to make sure the text rendering on my card templates matched the real cards as closely as possible... and they match practically perfectly, so this is actually a great test).\n\n \n\ngm_compare.jpg [http://www.joezimjs.com/_uploads/gm_compare.jpg]\n\n \n\nNow I'm more excited for this minstrel.
