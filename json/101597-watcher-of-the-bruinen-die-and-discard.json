His wording is \"after he defends\" not \"after he is declared as a defender\" like gondorian spearman. He is defending during all the resolution of the attack. Moreover, the \"after\" should happen when he is no longer a dender, not when he just became a \"defender\" because defends is a verb... is that how you should read english ? I could be wrong, not my native language."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101597-watcher-of-the-bruinen-die-and-discard/?do=findComment&comment=1017006","commentId":1017006,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1395174124,"content":"> Thanks for the responses!  Don't get me wrong -- I want to agree with you all and my first inclination is to read the card that way, but I'm thinking the text DOES remain active because it got activated the moment WotB stepped up to defend, and is a cloud that doesn't get cleared away until something else is discarded, regardless of WotB fate.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Another way of phrasing the conundrum might be:\n> \n>  \n> \n> By committing to defense (\"defends\"), which happens before the enemy resolves its possibly fatal attack, does he trigger the FORCED clause, which then remains in effect until after the resolution of the combat regardless of outcome?  OR\n> \n>  \n> \n> Does the FORCED take effect after the actual defense and combat resolution i.e. after he actually \"defends\" (and possibly dies, making the the clause moot becuase the card is no longer around)?\n\n \n\nThe rulebook says:\n\n \n\nDetermine combat damage. This is done by subtracting the defense strength (Ú) of the defending character from the attack strength of the attacking enemy. The remaining value is the amount of damage that must immediately be dealt to the defending character, possibly destroying that character.\n\n \n\nand:\n\n \n\nFor each point of damage dealt to a character or enemy, one damage token is placed on the character or enemy card. Each damage token on a hero, ally, or enemy card reduces that card’s hit points by 1. Damage tokens remain on a card until another effect heals or moves the damage off of the card, or until the card leaves play. Any time one of these cards has 0 hit points, it is immediately defeated. Defeated characters are placed in their owner’s discard pile, and defeated enemies are placed in the encounter discard pile.\n\n \n\nThe keyword immediatly is resolved before any after effects. The Watcher is thus already happily lying in your discard pile when his forced effect would trigger."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101597-watcher-of-the-bruinen-die-and-discard/?do=findComment&comment=1017666","commentId":1017666,"userName":"agentblack","timestamp":1395198968,"content":"Thanks people!  I can sleep easier now confident my hunch was correct all along...\n\nEdited March 19, 2014 by agentblack"}]}
