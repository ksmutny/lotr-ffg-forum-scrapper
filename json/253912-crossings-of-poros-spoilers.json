It's neutral, so a first turn play is easily possible or you can use stacked up ressources, because you can out of a specifics sphere cards.

For years I predicted, wished, BEGGED for the exploration of the  Artifact trait and particularly the themes of magic or lesser rings. There were people who disagreed with me and said we would never get these magical artifacts or these \"darker\" themes. They were at least partially wrong, because we did get a Lesser Ring, and like the Beorning it might be a hint of more Artifacts to come in the next cycle. Thematically speaking, one of these was something I most wanted to see. Not only that, but for the other reasons people listed this card is amazing, if anything to have 1 copy of a piece of Gandalf's Staff (the thing I use it for the most is resource acceleration anyway), emergency healing and readying in neutral. This card is incredible. I love every single part of it. Maybe it won't go in ALL my decks ever as I have like 10 physical decks built at all times, but if I were to buy enough copies of this pack, it probably would.\n\nEdited July 12, 2017 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253912-crossings-of-poros-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2877325","commentId":2877325,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1499878137,"content":"I wish they would do a proper Saruman."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253912-crossings-of-poros-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2877327","commentId":2877327,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1499878170,"content":"Quickbeam, Scorpagorn & Merry(T) can wipe the board of enemies with just a few rohan warhorses. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253912-crossings-of-poros-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2877330","commentId":2877330,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1499878270,"content":"> Just now, John Constantine said:\n> \n> I wish they would do a proper Saruman.\n\nNow that we have a Lesser Ring and they seem to be more open to explore artifice and corruption, it's all the more likely.

Actually I share some of your scepticism, but I still think it's a fun little card that can be useful. The way I play the game is to create a number of decks that last throughout each cycle* and have a sideboard of staples I can add into each. Currently I'm playing through Nightmare Hunt for Gollum Cycle with:\n\n- Gondor leadership deck\n\n- Dunedain leadership deck\n\n- Noldor deck\n\n- Silvan deck\n\n- Rohirrim deck\n\n- Gondor Outlands deck\n\n- Dwarf deck\n\n- Ent / Hobbits deck\n\nThe Magic Ring cards will simply go in my sideboard and then be inserted into one of these decks as I choose.\n\n(*I am occasionally forced to create specialist decks mid way through cycles but try not to if possible)\n\n(**My Gondor leadership deck (Denethor, Boromir, Theodred) absolutely stomped Nightmare Hunt for Gollum on Monday.
