To draw the required cards I had to create a new encounter deck from the encounter discard pile.

Does this simply mean that I have to raise my threat when I ready that hero? Or only when I ready him during the combat phase?\n\n \n\n4) The German translation sucks again. Not as bad as in the first Hobbit expansion, but I wished they would use the keywords more consistently. I mean there's a difference between \"bekämpfen\", \"angreifen\", \"in eine Kampf verwickeln\" etc. Especially if you choose \"angreifen\" (attack) as a translation of \"to engage\". Would be nice if someone could give me the English keywords for each of the enemies in this scenario. Unfortunatly I could only find \"Harbor Thug\" at cardgamedb."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78173-peril-in-pelargir-questions/?do=findComment&comment=753871","commentId":753871,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1359194059,"content":"1.
