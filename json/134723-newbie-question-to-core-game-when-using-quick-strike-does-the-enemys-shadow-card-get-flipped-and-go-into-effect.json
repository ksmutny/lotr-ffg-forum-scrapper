If a hero kills the enemy with Quick Strike before it has a chance to attack, then the Shadow card would be discarded without being resolved because the enemy was unable to attack.\n\n \n\nAlso, I highly recommend reviewing the the most recent version of the official FAQ, which answers this and many other questions you may have about the game. From p. 13 of the FAQ:\n\n \n\n \n\nQ: If an enemy does not attack or its attack is canceled, what happens to its shadow card(s)? \n\nA: At the end of the combat phase, discard each unresolved shadow card in play. (Do not resolve the effects on these shadow cards) \n\n \n\nI hope this helps. Welcome to the addiction and these boards… have fun!\n\nEdited February 12, 2015 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134723-newbie-question-to-core-game-when-using-quick-strike-does-the-enemys-shadow-card-get-flipped-and-go-into-effect/?do=findComment&comment=1445757","commentId":1445757,"userName":"thrylos1","timestamp":1423712819,"content":"Thank you very much!
