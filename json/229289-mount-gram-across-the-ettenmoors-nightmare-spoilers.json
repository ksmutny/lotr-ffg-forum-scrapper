I also bought Mount Gram which is a quest that could use a bit more bite in it. I have decided to wait on Ettenmoors which i found pretty tough anyway in solo play with one deck. They didnt stay in stock in the UK very long though.\n\n \n\nI dont generally buy nightmare sets as a rule (usually get them when on sale too) unless they are either a favourite quest of mine or i really think they will add to an otherwise relatively easy quest i enjoy. It is hard to justify buying nightmare quests when you have so many other original ones you haven't found time or money to buy yet. That said you could argue i suppose it is better to have less quests that you really like with more varient options to play them than have more quests which you dont like as much. Trouble is you dont know if you will like them until you play them."}]}
