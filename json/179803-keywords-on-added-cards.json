They suggested simply adding two copies of City Streets to avoid the nasty surge effect triggering later. As well as this city street has low threat and low questing points (Asfaloth can clear a copy in one go). I thought this was ingenious using the encounter deck's treacheries to actually prevent nasty effects from happening later in the game as well as minimising the harm of the treachery.\n\nSince then I am always looking for ways to exploit this tactic during games and pretty much any time I have to search the encounter deck/discard for enemies or locations and add them to staging I am looking for the cards with surge or nasty when revealed effects. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/179803-keywords-on-added-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1654555","commentId":1654555,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1433903900,"content":"> Sometimes, PocketWraith, you do have to go and search.  'Last player,' for example, is defined in the Khazad-dum insert, but not in any of the Dwarrowdelf AP rules inserts... and some of those scenarios continue to use 'last player' on encounter cards.  I always end up having to go back and look, because there is 'next player' and there is 'last player,' and in a solo game, one of them applies and one of them doesn't...
