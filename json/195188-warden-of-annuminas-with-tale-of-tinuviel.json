Until the end of the phase, add the exhausted character's willpower to the other character's willpower, attack and defence.\n\nThe important part is \"character\", not \"hero\".\n\nSo here is the point: You have a Warden of Annuminas and the Elladan hero. You are enganged with e.g. 5 enemies and you play ToT on Warden (at the moment 5 willpower) to ready Elladan. Now Elladan gets +5 attack. Assuming this will be enough to kill the first enemy. You pay one resource to ready him. You want to attack next enemy. Does he still have +5 willpower or will that value reduce by one for each fallen enemy???"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195188-warden-of-annuminas-with-tale-of-tinuviel/?do=findComment&comment=1922307","commentId":1922307,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1449480181,"content":"I guess that it follows the same rules as Gondorian Fire and the like, so the current answer is probably that Elladan's attack goes down 1 every time an enemy dies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195188-warden-of-annuminas-with-tale-of-tinuviel/?do=findComment&comment=1922483","commentId":1922483,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1449497415,"content":"> I guess that it follows the same rules as Gondorian Fire and the like, so the current answer is probably that Elladan's attack goes down 1 every time an enemy dies.\n\n \n\nI agree with this interpretation.  I think the developers have made it clear at this point that any \"until the end of the phase/round etc.\" effects are constantly updating as the game state changes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195188-warden-of-annuminas-with-tale-of-tinuviel/?do=findComment&comment=1922539","commentId":1922539,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1449499603,"content":"but with Gondorian Fire it is not a constant update, right?\n\nI allwas thought you pay 1 reseource to \"activate\" Gondorian Fire, thus having one less att. power than resources before, then paing would again add another \"one less than the current\" bonus.
