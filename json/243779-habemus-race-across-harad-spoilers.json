Sure, it costs 3 and asks for doomed to draw cards, but with reduction and/or Loragorn the doomed is just gravy.

Two of them in play, plus Kahliel with a Harad in hand to discard, which btw wouldn't be hard to pull at all, and you can easily boost WP/ATK/DEF by 3. I also want to add that, in this game, it is possible to quest and attack with several characters at the same time, but for defending you can do it only with just 1 defender at a time. This new Harad ally is the equivalent to defending with several characters at the same time. I don't know you guys but I find this particular quality to be awesome.

And yeah I know technically it doesn't have to be Isengard and Palantir themed. He could just print any random event or ally and give him Doomed and it would help The Seeing Stone (as he did in the Ring-Maker cycle), but I really hope more Doomed cards deal with the themes of Isengard and the dangers of corruption, like this Steward did.

I'm guessing that's because Mighty Warrior is in this pack (which wasn't clear, since it was spoiled in a card fan for The Mûmakil).\n\nSome first impressions:\n\nI love the art and flavour of Backtrack, even though I'm not sure how often it will see play.\n\nThe art on the tribesman looks like it could be art for an enemy card, since very few characters look fierce and furious like this one. Possible exceptions include Erebor Battle Master and Azain Silverbeard. Some characters, such as Tactics Théoden, Alt-art Aragorn, and ally Damrod, look fierce and determined, but not furious. The art does fit the flavour text, though.\n\nResource generation in Tactics is worthwhile. If you want to run Proud Hunters in a mono-Tactics deck, there are 8 Tactics heroes (Gimli, Legolas, Elladan, Boromir, Prince Imrahil, Théoden, Éomer, and Éowyn) and no unique allies with the Noble Trait, and 3 Tactics heroes (Elladan, Mablung, and Aragorn) and 1 unique ally (Yazan) with the Ranger trait.\n\nIn terms of power creep, Eryn Galen Settler is the first 2-cost non-unique ally (without a drawback) whose willpower plus attack equals 3. (Wandering Ent enters play exhausted, and Lindon Navigator forces you to discard.) Defense usually only matters on allies if the ally has relatively high defense and hit points, and Defender of Rammas is the only (non-Ent) 2-cost ally that's good as a repeated defender. Willpower and attack, however, are always useful. Even among unique 2 cost allies, the Settler's stats are only clearly inferior to Quickbeam, and roughly equal to Ceorl, Mablung, and Ghân-buri-Ghân. I don't necessarily see this as a problem, since it makes the decision about whether to use his ability more interesting. I imagine that the Settler will see play in a decent number of Lore decks for raw stat efficiency, and a sometimes-useful ability. As the designers develop the Woodman trait, it's interesting that all the Woodman allies so far have abilities that can interact with locations.\n\nThe art on Steward of Orthanc is reminiscent of the art on another steward, ally Denethor. Aside from the worthwhile ability, 2 willpower in neutral can be played round 1 in trisphere decks.

Those are still essential, but they're not quite enough to put you over the top. At the moment, I'm inclined to say that winning this quest requires quite a bit of luck, at least on 4 player.

Same goes for Secret Paths.\n\nThe best trick I can think of is to use encounter deck manipulation (Lore Denethor, Risk Some Light) to ensure that the Orcs don't place a few extra progress each round.\n\nEdited April 5, 2017 by AstroSnail\nTo remove unintended formatting"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243779-habemus-race-across-harad-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2718054","commentId":2718054,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1491370856,"content":"We barely edged it out Monday with three players: Caldara.deck, Three Hunters, and The Deck You Want Your Friend To Play.

Removed an Uruk Pursuer with None Returned, and avoided a second Uruk Pursuer with The Door is Closed! The Orcs only had 5 progress on stage 4D when we cleared River Harnen.\n\nOverall, I'd say this support deck greatly enhanced our chances of success.

Should be like in Shadow in Flame where the Balrog can attack you and remain in the staging area at the same time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243779-habemus-race-across-harad-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2750036","commentId":2750036,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1493055574,"content":"I am not even sure why 1D says that the Chiefain can't leave the orc area, as we advance to stage 2B immediately and aren't in stage 1 together with the orcs at any time and ANY enemy can't leave the orc area as long as we are in another stage. Guess it is just a reminder.\n\nAs soon as the orcs get to stage 2 the chieftain can leave (but can't take damage) and returns to the orc area to make progress at the end of each quest phase.\n\nSo all in all I would say as long as you are ahead, the chieftain does NOT engage/attack you. I am sure if you would need to fight him, they would have worded it like \"considered...\" to make it crystal clear he still is in the orc area, but also engaged.\n\n \n\nSome other thoughts why he should only fight you why you are in the same stage: \n1. If not, the quest would be pretty brutal. You have a location and have to put the rider somewhere and deal with it's threat/the extra progress from the orcs AND defend against a five attack enemy every round without beeing able to kill him.\n\n2. Story-wise the different stages show if you are ahead of the orcs or not. As long as they didn't catch up (same stage) it makes no sense for the chieftain to being able to attack you (he's just \"too far away\"). Once he catches up things change until you manage to escape again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243779-habemus-race-across-harad-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2750162","commentId":2750162,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1493058553,"content":"When the spoilers for the next pack?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243779-habemus-race-across-harad-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2750608","commentId":2750608,"userName":"donkler","timestamp":1493068170,"content":"> 2 hours ago, John Constantine said:\n> \n> When the spoilers for the next pack?\n\nI was hoping the next pack would be out this week, but it's status is still showing as on the boat."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243779-habemus-race-across-harad-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2753568","commentId":2753568,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1493180647,"content":"It does seem like the deliveries are being stretched out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243779-habemus-race-across-harad-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2753689","commentId":2753689,"userName":"wolframius","timestamp":1493193585,"content":"> 3 hours ago, Bullroarer Took said:\n> \n> It does seem like the deliveries are being stretched out.\n\nConspiracy time: the dream-chaser to harad releases were rushed because the licenses had to be renewed and if for some reason they couldn't, they had to release everything before the end of the year. \n\nNow the license has been renewed and Mountain of fire got a MEC 7 spots ahead and they are not in a hurry anymore.\n\n \n\nTo be clear: I'm joking."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243779-habemus-race-across-harad-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2753709","commentId":2753709,"userName":"Crabble","timestamp":1493194472,"content":"Careful wolframius that was a borderline-\"The game is dying\" post. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243779-habemus-race-across-harad-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2753793","commentId":2753793,"userName":"wolframius","timestamp":1493200998,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Crabble said:\n> \n> Careful wolframius that was a borderline-\"The game is dying\" post. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nMore like \"game was in the verge of dying but now is reborn, believe me!\" :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243779-habemus-race-across-harad-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2754167","commentId":2754167,"userName":"donkler","timestamp":1493217881,"content":"I'm surprised there were no \"GAME IS DEAD\" threads when the co-op module of Runebound was announced earlier this month. "}]}
