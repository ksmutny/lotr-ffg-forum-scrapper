So far I have 2 questions:\n\n1 - Concerning guarded objective. If an enemy is guarding the objective, do you treat it like an enemy and move it to a player's area for combat and once defeated, move back the objective to the staging area? If guarded by a location, once you have traveled to the location and explored it, when discarded the objective move back to the staging area?\n\n2 - Forest Spider: \"Forced: After Forest Spider engages a player, it gets +1 ATK until the end of the round.\" Does this apply when the Player engagement step, the engagement checks step or both? If Forest Spider aren't killed this round, next round, since they are already engaged, they remain at 2 ATK or 3 again? I am confused because the example in the rulebook use the Forest Spider but they don't give the +1 ATK.\n\nThanks\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82693-new-players-question/?do=findComment&comment=787276","commentId":787276,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1366543984,"content":"Goldenrod said:\n\nI ordered the game and waiting to receive it.

Always place progress tokens on an active\nlocation instead of the quest, unless the ability\nspecifically states to bypass any active location.\n\nrich"}]}
