Sorry-\n\nSince LOTR is a cooperative LCG game, do you know what FFG’s plans are for it? League play? Tourney play? Prize support? Participation support? I guess, I’m curious how the cooperative game will work in a league setting: one win/all win? Or just for fun weekly scenarios? Or hasn’t that been discussed yet?\n\nHow many adventures/month is forcasted? (one a month, 2? 3? 6?)- I guess my question is-- how much will I need to budget each month to a new game? $40 core, and $10 packs is affordable- but $60/moth for adventure is too much.\n\n \n\nI’m kind of looking for a game to get into at the release- so I don’t have to buy a core game and a huge bunch of expansions just to get caught up with other players. Something that’ll have weekly/monthly league/tourney events. Well, I'll admit it, I do like promos and rewards. (I'm a marketing junkie). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nUnfortunatly, I missed the big LCG weekend- I would have liked a demo game of LOTR. I do like the idea of thouhg and am excited about it-\n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47128-cooperative-league-play/?do=findComment&comment=472234","commentId":472234,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1305970902,"content":"What little we know is 2 player tournaments against a new scenario and best score wins the day.\n\n \n\n1 adventure pack per month is how all the LCG's work.

You can use Gandalf, but that's about it. If you can use Gandalf, The Galadhrim's Greeting, then cards that can recurse both Gandalf and Greeting, then you are miles ahead of the next sphere in terms of threat reduction. I've not experienced a comparable effect with other spheres, no matter what their cards do. While you can certainly pass a scenario, the idea in a tournament is to do so with the lowest score, and anything with spirit in it, will just be much better at it. Will other spheres eventually balance out? I certainly hope so, I don't want to see spirit become an auto include in any deck that aspires to be competitive at a tournament. But, as I pointed out above, with smaller amounts of cards per new release, this might take a while to change. Also, if the Warhammer lcg is any guide, changing the meta in lcgs is slower than usual because the new packs are finalized well in advance of any issues that might pop up. Time will tell, but this is my best guess, right now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47128-cooperative-league-play/?do=findComment&comment=472670","commentId":472670,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1306070107,"content":"Continuing this discussion, you have to think about all of the different things that check threat:\n\n \n\nLosing\n\nEngagement Checks (i.e. are enemies all over you?)\n\nTreachery Cards (raise threat and check 35)\n\n \n\nOn top of all the things that add threat...\n\nWhat's the point?

Every game has a meta and there's a reason why it becomes one. If you don't have the max amount of the best cards in your deck you will be at a disadvantage to those who do.

The Game of Thrones LCG was redone so that the expansions and adventure packs would have 3 of each card. There was apparently a big uproar prior to this over having to buy multiple adventure packs and expansions to get to the 3 card limit. FFG nicely decided to change this so that you only had to buy one product to get to the 3 card limit. The 1st LotR adventure pack has the following:\n\n- A new hero\n\n- A scenario (3 cards)\n\n- An encounter deck to go with the scenario.\n\n- An assortment of cards for each sphere plus the neutral card that was already revealed. Each type of card comes with 3 copies.\n\n \n\nBut I'd love to hear more about official tournament play. The GenCon tournament has been announced. I haven't seen a word about the format though. I think all of the LCGs have in store tournament kits that stores can purchase to run tournaments with prize support. I don't have any details about this though but it would be good to know how this works for LotR LCG since it's cooperative compared to the other three LCGs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47128-cooperative-league-play/?do=findComment&comment=483670","commentId":483670,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1307754377,"content":"If i understand right the contest of the adventure pack Hunt for Gollum should looks like this:\n\ntotal 60 cards.\n\n1 hero (1 copy) 1\n\n9 player cards (3 copies each) 27\n\n3 quest cards (1 copy each)  3\n\n29 encounter cards   29\n\nSo looks like will be very cool quest. like someone say : the encounter deck of the H.f.
