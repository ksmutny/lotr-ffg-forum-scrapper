If it's centered on Thranduil, it might be called something like The Elvenking or King of the Woodland Realm. If it's centered on the Men of Dale and Erebor, it might be called something like The Free Peoples to celebrate the cooperation among different peoples to rebuild the North lands following the events of The Hobbit. Or, if it takes place farther north/east in less populated areas I could see it called The Northern Wilds, The Wild Wastes, or The Wilds of Rhun -- something like that. I don't think we'll see The Iron Hills as the focus, but it might appear in some form as a quest. Individual quests might focus on The Withered Heath, Scatha's legacy, defending The Woodland Realm, attacks by drakes or other creatures on Erebor/Dale, maybe a plot by Sauron's agents to turn or sabotage the Iron Hills dwarves or the men of the plains of Rhun."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251388-guess-the-name-of-the-next-deluxe-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=2821309","commentId":2821309,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1496612887,"content":"> 4 hours ago, PocketWraith said:\n> \n> I feel like The Withered Heath would be more likely to crop up as the name of an adventure pack than a deluxe.\n\nI'm aware of this.

On the other hand we already visited a lot of middle-earth. And we already know the name of the last AP - \"The crossing of Poros\". If the wiki speaks the truth (http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Crossings_of_Poros [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Crossings_of_Poros]) there is/was a canonical battle at the river where Gondor and Rohan fought off an Haradrim attack. FFG in the past has often used unexplained or otherwise blank chapters of middle-earth history and made up the explanation (best example would be the ringmaker cycle).\nSo I think it could be fitting, that FFG explains the attack in a way, that out flight from Harad with our new found allies enrages the Haradrim under Saurons command so much that they muster an army to chase us into Ithilien, but we get saved by the men of the west. If you look at the VoI-Box and Ringmaker cycle you never really had the feeling of being in Rohan (or at least I didn't) so I think we could make a visit there. The Rohirim who save us during our crossing of Poros have a task for us and as the heroes we are, we follow and aid them.\nOf course the task gets much more complex than it first looks like and we end up travelling to the north (mirkwood, dale, rhûn...), but I think this would mainly be the story of the cycle while the Box focuses on the different lands and cities of Rohan (East/Westfold, Edoras, Aldburg...), where we might have to deal with first hints of Saruman's treason, so the box would be called:\n\n\"The Land of the Horse-lords\"\n\nI am not that much of an expert on middle-earth history and this game's storytelling, so i don't know if my theory makes sense time wise (If anyone knows better: the battle of Poros was 2885 TA and it is said that Túrin II was steward at this time; at least during the Blood of Numenor cycle Denethor was already steward, but I know not all cycles are chronological)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251388-guess-the-name-of-the-next-deluxe-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=2824629","commentId":2824629,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1496774344,"content":"I'm convinced by Calvadur.

I would imagine a cycle where the kingdoms of men, elves and dwarves must unite after drifting apart again, in order to fend off the threat posed by Gundabad orcs, dragons of the Withered Heath, and easterlings around the time of the War of the Ring.\n\nThat could see a fair bit of travelling across Wilderland, through Mirkwood, Dale/Erebor, the Grey Mountains, the Withered Heath and maybe even Rhun. Would make for a pretty epic cycle and a worthy follow-up to the by then complete LotR saga... and possibly a fitting full circle conclusion if that's where the game line ends?\n\nEdited June 7, 2017 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251388-guess-the-name-of-the-next-deluxe-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=2827446","commentId":2827446,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1496921145,"content":"The problem with Rohan is (as the LotR MMO found) it's rather homogeneous and therefore really boring.

I am confident that FFG will come up with very nice ideas while staying true to the Middle-Earth lore. The Northern reaches still remain unexplored within the game, though the last Hobbit saga scenarios weren't too far from there.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251388-guess-the-name-of-the-next-deluxe-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=2828342","commentId":2828342,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1496951951,"content":"Speaking of dragons and the Withered Heath, I did put together a custom three-adventure cycle based loosely around Fram Framson slaying Scatha.
