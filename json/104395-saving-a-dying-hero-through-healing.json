If a shadow added to the attack strength, then the warden could be used to remove damage from beregond before he is dealt more damage. But that is only going to work if the shadow says enemy gets +x attack. If the shadow removed a defender from play or said deal X damage, those happen immediately with no action window, so only a reponse that cancels a shadow card will work.\n\nI wonder if that's the type of situation the OP is referring to?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104395-saving-a-dying-hero-through-healing/?do=findComment&comment=1056662","commentId":1056662,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1398100865,"content":"No sillyhead, in all those situations Beregond would have received more damage than his total life points (4) in one fell swoop!  Getting attacked for 9 or 10 is no fluffy matter.  And if the player thought that using Warden in that situation was legal, he could have decided not to chump block based on that idea alone -- if a chump blocker was even available.  All I'm saying is that it does not take a whole lot of imagination to come up with a plausible scenario for this to happen.\n\nEdited April 21, 2014 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104395-saving-a-dying-hero-through-healing/?do=findComment&comment=1057015","commentId":1057015,"userName":"7theye","timestamp":1398116891,"content":"Thanks guys.

However if he had damage on him, before the attack is resolved after the shadow cards are revealed it's possible to heal existing damage. (So if had 3 hit points remaining and the attack just managed to kill him, he would live). "}]}
