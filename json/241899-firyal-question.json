She says \"After Firyal commits to the quest look at the top card of the encounter deck. Then you may discard the looked at card.\" While i'm committing characters to the quest, do I commit them one by one? If so then Firyal can commit first and act like a pseudo Henamarth. Even if this doesn't work, in multiplayer if you are the first player, you would commit all your characters, trigger her response, and then are able to advise your partner on how to quest right?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241899-firyal-question/?do=findComment&comment=2627510","commentId":2627510,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1486395603,"content":"You commit all your characters at the same time.
