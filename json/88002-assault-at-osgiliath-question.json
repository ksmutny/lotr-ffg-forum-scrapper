I couldn't see a restriction, so I guess that means I can exhaust all my heroes during the combat phase and that will get me three progress tokens on Old Harbor?\n\n \n\nThat sounds a bit silly, because if you play solo with a lore mono deck all you have to do is to play Risk Some Light to make sure that you won't draw an Osgiliath location during the first couple of turns (and to choose an enemy with a high engaging cost). That way you could finish the quest after two turns... :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]\n\n \n\nOther than that it would make the quest more challenging if there was a restriction."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88002-assault-at-osgiliath-question/?do=findComment&comment=833988","commentId":833988,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1375935309,"content":"Hmmmm sounds like our glorious designers make mistake again.

Solo games can be interesting, but it totally depends on the cards that you are revealing from the encounter deck. If you draw no Osgiliath location in your frist 2-3 turns you win it easily. Perhaps they should have added that you have to own control of at least three Osgiliath locations. I think that's how I'm gonna play it inthe future.\n\nEdited August 8, 2013 by leptokurt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88002-assault-at-osgiliath-question/?do=findComment&comment=836558","commentId":836558,"userName":"-nebur-","timestamp":1376207548,"content":"haha, very silly...\n\nwith a \"tactic-Boromir-solo-deck\" you can easy gain a score under 20 :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]"}]}
