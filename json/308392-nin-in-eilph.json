Could only beat it with a Lore Aragorn deck.\n\nI have yet to play a nightmare version of anything.  I still have plenty of content to grind through in the \"regular\" game, and the original versions are challenging enough for my taste.  I hear the nightmare versions aren't always harder, but are sometimes \"fixed\", whatever that means.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308392-nin-in-eilph/?do=findComment&comment=3939525","commentId":3939525,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1589479616,"content":"> 48 minutes ago, Vince79 said:\n> \n> I hear the nightmare versions aren't always harder, but are sometimes \"fixed\", whatever that means.  \n\nThat mostly happens for the early quests. For example, Nightmare Conflict at the Carrock forces you to put 1 progress on the first quest stage each round, so you can't turtle forever and then kill the trolls with ease when you finally move on.\n\nNightmare Dead Marshes automatically shuffles Gollum back into the deck if he gets discarded, so you don't have to go searching through the whole encounter deck for him if you fail enough escape tests.\n\nMost of the early nightmare quests also significantly tighten up the theme of the quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308392-nin-in-eilph/?do=findComment&comment=3939645","commentId":3939645,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1589495138,"content":"I think this quest is the only quest where if someone suggested we play it I would always say no."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308392-nin-in-eilph/?do=findComment&comment=3939661","commentId":3939661,"userName":"Preotet","timestamp":1589497278,"content":"I, too, disliked it at first, then it has grown on me.
