We have many archetype needing more support.\n\nStill some mechanic are missing that could benefits from/fuel a new archetype to enter the game: e.g. taking benefits from enemies being in the staging area, some treachery interaction, surge keyword built as a drawback in very powerful player cards, etc...\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297446-a-shadow-in-the-east-is-on-the-boat/?do=findComment&comment=3752108","commentId":3752108,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1564653142,"content":"It's already available here in the Netherlands.

You can check that for stores. If some don't ship to your country, you can try to get someone in the country of origin to buy it for you and then ship it to your address. \n\nHere's the sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEB-tGlr21kKTt7QnffQ8kdxbdNVabZgZqgKf50bRwE/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEB-tGlr21kKTt7QnffQ8kdxbdNVabZgZqgKf50bRwE/edit?usp=sharing]\nFeel free to update it with things in stock in your area. It hasn't been updated in a while, but it can't all be sold out.\n\nAmazon (both British and German versions of the site) also tends to ship to many EU countries and has some stock here and there. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297446-a-shadow-in-the-east-is-on-the-boat/?do=findComment&comment=3752560","commentId":3752560,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1564677272,"content":"Arrived home from work to find my copy waiting for me.
