I'm proud to present you an OCTGN exclusive \"Thugs to the Rescue\" custom player card set, featuring new Thug character trait and Mischief event trait and their full support all-around with some stuff for outside of trait machinations and synergies. This set contains 10 new heroes, 20 new allies, 10 new attachments and 14 new events to boost your options in a fight against the Dark Lord. \n\n \n\nPromotional stuff aside, this was inspired by a \"Creative Artwork Cards\" thread from the FFG forums, when I did a few thugy allies for the sake of it and I started to get ideas one after one until they overwhelmed me and this \"expansion\" was a result. Here's the pictures:\n\n \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/9EIyh#0 [http://imgur.com/a/9EIyh#0]\n\n \n\nI'll be honored if you'll check it out. I'll be even more honored if you'll install it and give it a spin. And I'll be happiest person in the world if you would leave any comments and/or suggestions about it, regardless of what it is: unfitting art, balance problems, misspelling or bad wording and etc.\n\n \n\nHere is the set iself:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/270c0ww5i3cz2w1/Sets.rar [https://www.dropbox.com/s/270c0ww5i3cz2w1/Sets.rar]\n\n \n\nTo install the set, navigate to MyDocuments\\OCTGN\\GameDatabase\\a21af4e8-be4b-4cda-a6b6-534f9717391f\\ and drop there the \"Sets\" folder from the Sets.rar. Overwrite any conflicts and stuff.\n\n \n\n \n\nThanks for your time.\n\nEdited March 21, 2014 by MyNeighbourTrololo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100494-octgn-unofficial-set-thugs-to-the-rescue/?do=findComment&comment=1001820","commentId":1001820,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1393892279,"content":"Wow!
