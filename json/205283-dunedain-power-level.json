I was greatly surprised of the dunedain decks power level.\n\nI have played some solo dunedain decks quite a bit, and was not surprised by the resource acceleration, normal 3 resources, Amarthiul, Steward and Heir of Valandil, but the card draw was even more powerful than I thought. The dunedain deck ran out of cards faster than the noldor deck.\n\nAnd with Cirdan, it's really hard to not burn through the deck fast.\n\nAnother thing, I know that the dunedain deck is powerful in combat, but not HOW powerful it is. For about 5 turns I was engaged with 8 enemies at the same time, and defending 9 enemies and killing the Witch-King one turn. And in the whole game, NO allies did fall in combat.\n\nThen it's the willpower. I had not meant to make good willpower, but the last turn the noldor deck quested for 20 and the dunedain for 39. THAT is real power, and it almost feels like a dwarf power level deck.\n\nHow powerful do you think the dunedain deck is?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205283-dunedain-power-level/?do=findComment&comment=2097606","commentId":2097606,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1457776788,"content":"I've been experimenting with pairing an Aragorn/Amarthiul/Halbarad deck with Cirdan/Arwen/Erestor, and I feel they have the potential to be solid decks, but need some tweaking to flow smoothly - what decklists did you use?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205283-dunedain-power-level/?do=findComment&comment=2097918","commentId":2097918,"userName":"DurinVoronwe","timestamp":1457803135,"content":"I can write them down later, I don't have them avilible right NOW.

Forest Snare and help with two other, and hasty stroke was used for one attack, but my main stratergy is to take all hits with the face and simply not care about it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205283-dunedain-power-level/?do=findComment&comment=2100293","commentId":2100293,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1457969452,"content":"> I'm consistently getting stomped by shadow effects in my leadership-tactics Dunedain deck.

Restricting yourself by not allowing any Spirit or Lore cards, which can provide this easily, is going to make it a lot tougher. I don't think this is a fundamental inconsistency."}]}
