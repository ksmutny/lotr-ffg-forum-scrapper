I was contemplating that it would be nice to have something like an overarching goal. Besides that I always pondered over the question which fraction or which decks are the strongest against a variety of quests and be able to have something like an objective criteria.\n\n\n\nSo I came up with the idea of a deck championship. The idea in itself is pretty simple: select a number of quests that are to be played, think in some kind of algorithm to measure performance with and ad some rule to restrain deck customization between scenarios. Now, as I have stated, while I have been a player since year 1 and 2 and plays made sure to buy the packs in advances, I was not always able to actually play a lot of games and there are a lot players on this board who are more experienced than I am. So I invite you to help me iron out the rulebook so to speak and improve the experience. In the best case scenario that I have in my head, we might afterwards maybe make a form game where each person interested submits a deck and we play a scenario each 2 week. But obviously this is still a far way off and I have quit a lot of questions. So I will start off with the more obvious stuff:\n\n\n\n1.Playing format:\n\n\n\nI was thinking that the championship would consist of about 20 to 25 quests of differing focus and difficulty level, so that decks are tested in different ways. I would not necessarily include the most punishing ones, but more on that later.\n\n\n\nA competing deck would play a best-of-5 series against each quest. But I would add a little twist: While such a series would stop at three wins, it would not necessarily stop at 3 loses. The player might voluntarily decide to play more games up until the total of games played caps off at 5. So (s)he gets a chance to improve the record, but this comes with the risk of cumulating more loses.\n\n\n\nAt first I was also toying with building the championship like a golf course with the idea that each deck plays a quest until it wins two games (with a limit of games played in total obviously), but I think the best-of-5 works better.\n\n\n\nI honestly like this rather simple structure and would not like to stray too far away from it. Later I will get back to the number of quests, etc.\n\n\n\n2.Rating of player performance\n\n\n\nIt is needless to say that a simple Win-Loss record would not do this game any justice. A win against Carn Dum should be worth more than 3 wins against Fangorn. I think I am not alone when I assess the official difficulty rating as not being adequate. Therefore I would use the difficulty rating from hall of beorn as the foundation. While this is not perfect (naturally earlier quests have been rated a lot more often), I would consider it as an improvement.\n\n\n\nI thought off three distinct ways to calculate a score for the performance against a quest. Each has its pro and cons, I guess, so I am really interested in feedback about this. In the following x denominates the difficulty rating of a quest divided by 10, W the numer of wins and L the number of loses against a quest:\n\n\n\nOption 1: x*W – min(1-x; 0.01)*N\n\n\n\nThis is pretty straight forward in that each win and loss is weighted by the difficulty of the quest, so that losses against “easy” quests can be quite punishing while Wins against the heavy hitters make a hugh difference. I use the minimum function so that losses even against the hardes quests don’t go unpunished.\n\n\n\nOption 2: (0.5 +0.5*x)*S – (0.5 + 0.5* min(1-x; 0.01))*N\n\n\n\nThe difference here is that I also weighted the difficulty weighting of the wins/losses. The idea is that wins and a loss should always have meaning and not be too dependent off the difficulty of the quest. If this added weighting parameters are 0.5/0.5 or be distributed differently would be up for discussion.\n\n\n\nOption 3: max(x*S – min(1 – x , 0.01)*N; 0)\n\n\n\nFor those of you not familiar with the max/min function: This option is basically like Option 1 with the difference that you could never dip below 0 on the rating. This means that you should probably always play the full 5 games when you are losing. I think it takes away from strategic decisions, so it would not be my favorite.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nI am aware that a lot of ways to do it differently and I would be have if someone might have a better idea. So it could be one of the options or a new idea.\n\n\n\n3.Deck construction rules:\n\n\n\nThis will probably provoke the most discussion. Here are my thoughts about rules:\n\n\n\na. 3 heroes + 2 reserve heroes\n\n\n\nquestion: should be 1 reserve hero only\n\n\n\nb. deck size: 50 – 55 cards (special Erestor rule: 50 -70 cards but than Erestor may never go to the “bench”) + 7 sideboard cards.\n\n\n\nBetween plays the player may vary the number of copies of cards in his deck, but he may only take out a card of his “core deck” completely if he subs in a set of side board card (1-3 copies) in its place. A set of sideboard cards can only replace 1 set from the core deck (so for example if a player takes out 3 1-off cards from his core deck, he cannot replace it with 3 copies of 1 sideboard-card, instead he must sub in 3 sideboardcards (1-3 copies each)). A player might add a sideboard card without taking out a “core card” but he must be aware of the deck cap of 55.\n\n\n\nQuestion: how many sideboard cards should there be? I was considering 5, 7 and 10. In the end I considered 10 to be too much as it would take away from the challenge of feeling restriction when constructing the deck.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTheme mode:\n\n\n\nNow, I love to build theme decks, so I had to add a theme mode in building more restriction if one chose to play this way. In this mode there would be the following addition rules:\n\n\n\nc. Of the 5 (or 4) heroes only one might be of a different tribe/fraction\n\n\n\nd. the deck might at any time only include 3 sets of cards from another tribe/fraction (“thematic concession”). In total (core deck and sideboard cards) only 6 sets of such cards are allowed.\n\n\n\nWhen does a card belong to a fraction/tribe?\n\n\n\nIn some cases this is quiet easy (when it is more or less printed on the card) in others it is not that easy. For example: I would say that rohan warhorse belongs to the rohan fraction even though the card is not restricted to the rohan trait. I also think such a rule applies to all named horses, all the dunedain signs I would consider belonging to the dunedain tribe. Galadriels greeting I would not consider belonging to a fraction, but I am not so sure about Elronds Counsel. I think here is much discussion to be had.\n\n\n\ne. Main factions are:\n\n\n\nGondor, Rohan, Noldor, Silva, Dwarf, Hobbit, Dunedain, Dale (hope I have not forgotten anyone)\n\n\n\nf. special rules for small factions:\n\n\n\nA deck might be constructed with two fractions, but then at least one of these fractions must be: Ent, Eagles, Outlands, Harad, Beoring, Woodmen, Creatures( & Radagast), Isengard (& Saruman). Such decks may only at any moment include one set of cards of thematic concession and 2 of such total.\n\n\n\ng. Deck of the free people: all heroes must be of different tribes and no more than 3 sets of allies may be of the same tribe (in total)\n\n\n\nh. Special rulings:\nGaladriel is not a “thematic concession” in silvan decks\n\n\n\nElladan and Elrohir are not thematic concessions in dunedain decks\n\n\n\nAlly Gandalf does not count towards the thematic concession cap but hero Gandalf does\n\n\n\nImrahil is not a thematic concession in an Outland deck\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nI guess some of you are more familiar with the lore might come up with more special rulings.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n4.Season structure:\n\n\n\nMy idea is the following: There is a pre-season in which you can fine tune your deck: This pre-season are the first 2 quests of the core set (passage through mirkwood and journey down (?) the Anduin). You might play them as often as you like.\n\n\n\nAfter that the season starts. I was thinking that 20 quests might be a good idea, but 15 or 25 might work even better. As mentioned before I have only played through 5 cycles. I came up with the following list. I did not consider saga quests, mind you:\n\n\n\nQuest 1: Hunt for Gollom  à An easy start to get going\n\n\n\nQuest 2: Massing at Osgiliath à I really like the balance of this quest, but since not everybody has this, it can be replaced\n\n\n\nQuest 3: The seventh level\n\n\n\nQuest 4:The Redhorn gate\n\n\n\nQuest 5: Foundation of stone\n\n\n\nQuest 6: Into Ithilien\n\n\n\nQuest 7: The steward’s fear\n\n\n\nQuest 8: The Morgul Vale\n\n\n\nQuest 9: The Fords of Isen\n\n\n\nQuest 10: The Dunland Trap\n\n\n\nQuest 11: The Three Trials\n\n\n\nQuest 12: Trouble in Tharbad\n\n\n\nQuest 13: The weather hills\n\n\n\nQuest 14: Dadmen’s dike\n\n\n\nQuest 15: Escape from Mount Gram\n\n\n\nQuest 16: The Dream Realm\n\n\n\nQuest 17-20: ?\n\n\n\nWhat quests would you consider?\n\n\n\nThe beauty of this is, that it is like creating a golf course and you can make it really hard or a bit softer (if you plan a “league” for weaker, very thematic decks).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAnyways that’s it for now. I would really appreciate your feedback.\n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305222-new-playing-mode-deck-championship/?do=findComment&comment=3883953","commentId":3883953,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1580536462,"content":"way to complicated.
