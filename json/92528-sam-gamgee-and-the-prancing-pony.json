It doesn't matter if it comes from the staging area, the encounter deck, discard pile, or even out of play: if it ends up in your play area, it has engaged you. And if that enemy's engagement cost is higher than your threat, Sam's ability will trigger at that time.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92528-sam-gamgee-and-the-prancing-pony/?do=findComment&comment=895174","commentId":895174,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1382548044,"content":"really....nice, another good use for sam :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92528-sam-gamgee-and-the-prancing-pony/?do=findComment&comment=896398","commentId":896398,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1382702593,"content":"I didn't expect that.
