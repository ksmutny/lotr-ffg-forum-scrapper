Ungoliant's Spawn.  The \"when revealed\" effect floors our questing capability.\n\nNow, at this point we are allowed to play event cards, am I correct?  This is where our success hinges.  My partner played a Dwarven Tomb, searched her discard pile for a A Test of Will, paid for and played it to cancel the \"when revealed\" effect, putting us well over the maximum necessary, and we were out of there. \n\nWas that permissable?  I don't see anything about a limitation on the number of cards you can play, or whether you have to wait to use a card after you grab it with Dwarven Tomb.\n\nAs a side note, this quest also had a beautiful moment where 2 Cavern Guardians and an Orc Guard were engaged with my partner.  Both guardians had 1 point of damage on them, courtesy of Thalin in the previous questing phase.  Along comes Legolas with Rain of Arrows and, hey presto! No more baddies.\n\nGS"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60696-events-in-questing-phase/?do=findComment&comment=596330","commentId":596330,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1329725201,"content":"Yes, that is all fine and dandy.

So for example, canceling a treachery and drawing a 2nd one, you can not untap and cancel the new one and draw a 3rd. I only just got this worked out like a few weeks ago so it seams this rule still has not really sunk in... I miss a stack.. just makes so much more sens and easier to learn timings"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60696-events-in-questing-phase/?do=findComment&comment=596690","commentId":596690,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1329770479,"content":"Argh, now that I hear this, it does make sense. \n\nI am free to play events after cards are revealed but I can only trigger a response like ToW immediately after the \"when revealed\" comes up.  So if I choose to play Dwarven Tomb, I'm essentially passing on the chance to trigger any response to the \"when revealed\" effect, yes?  And further, when the \"when revealed\" effect came up, ToW was sitting in the DECK and not in my hand, so it would be invalid to suggest that this \"when revealed\" could be used to trigger the response on ToW.\n\nWhat I COULD have done was play Dwarven Tomb before the quest cards were revealed, and had ToW in my hand just in case.  \"When revealed\" was the only thing that could have disrupted my win at that point,  so I should have foreseen it.\n\n*sigh*... that \"win\" will always have an asterisk next to it now, since we essentially discontinued play before the game came to any sort of resolution (also known as a forfeit!!)  But I will not tell my wife.  I will take this knowledge to the grave!\n\nAlso, I'm a card game novice.   What is a \"stack?\"\n\nThanks for the discussion guys. \n\nGS"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60696-events-in-questing-phase/?do=findComment&comment=596751","commentId":596751,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1329783606,"content":"this dosn't make sense... this timing issue is so confusing as the rules are just so muddy and badly written...\n\nIf all this crap is true. then how can you cast Test of Will at all to cancel a when revealed..

Valiant Sac, is a response speed event, while astonishing speed is a action...\n\nSo basically there is no such things as \"event\" speed.. as they key off action / response?\n\n\n\nYeah, that's one way to think of it. The timing structure for \"action\" events is entirely different from that of \"response\" events. The real key is the fact that responses can only be triggered immediately after their specified trigger occurs. If you play an \"action\" card after revealing encounter cards, you are necessarily doing so in the action window after the staging step (per the timing chart in the rules). In the OP's example, as soon as Dwarven Tomb is played, the players have essentially declined the option to respond to the Spawn's \"when revealed\" effect. \n\nThe real lesson here, as the OP noted, is to play your Dwarven Tomb and retrieve your cancel effect earlier--before you reveal encounter cards happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]Frustrating, maybe, but a good learning experience."}]}
