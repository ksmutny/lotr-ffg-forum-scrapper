In JdtA you have to set up random encounters which can influence your choice. if it's an enemy, you might want to have an ally with a good defense in your hand. If it's a location, you want to get cards that provide you with WP in your starting hand. Etc.\n\n \n\nApart from that I agree that you have to draw your cards before setting up the quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59325-when-exactly-are-you-meant-to-flip-to-1b/?do=findComment&comment=582901","commentId":582901,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1327178323,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nhowever i would say it goes like this-\n\nset up quest according to 1a\n\ndraw your 6 start cards\n\nthen flip and follow out when revealed effects\n\n \n\nThis is how we like to play. BUT the \"real\" rules are that you draw your 6, decide on the mulligan or not and maybe e-draw those 6... then follow 1a, then 1b, then start round 0.\n\nI prefer it the other way as you can mulligan based on board position, then the quest deck gets one more chance to suprise you. .. the way it is now.. why do we even have 2 sides to the quest? 1a should just be a long story flavour text, and 1b have quest set up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59325-when-exactly-are-you-meant-to-flip-to-1b/?do=findComment&comment=583390","commentId":583390,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1327275828,"content":"radiskull said:\n\n From p.10 of the rulebook, you are supposed to draw your starting hand, and decide whether to mulligan, before setting the quest deck and following the instructions on the quest cards.\n\n \n\nWhile I agree that it usually won't make a difference, those are the rules.\n\n\n\nExcept when you get a treachery that forces you discard all event cards from your hands... We got that in setup once and we were both holding a ton of events. Really hurt us. I had to double check the order to make sure we really did have to discard."}]}
