While it technically seems true, it seems (to me) against the intent/spirit of the overall adventure.\n\nSo am I thinking too hard about it, or is that truly the intent? (It would seem extremely harsh if you're to potentially advance the Orcs Area twice in the same turn, especially since more have been added to the Orcs Area after finishing the prior stage that you never had a chance to respond to.) Hoping there's some FAQ I'm missing, but not sure.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253804-race-across-harad-orcs-area-quest-timing-issue-twice-in-some-rounds/?do=findComment&comment=2873286","commentId":2873286,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1499662967,"content":"From cmabr002's large collection of Q&As in this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248142-the-dead-marshes-sneak-attack/]:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> You should only resolve Forced effects that are in play and active at the time of their trigger.\n\nThe specific question being answered is the same concept for another card, so it's definitive that the new Forced effect does not occur.\n\nEdited July 10, 2017 by NathanH"}]}
