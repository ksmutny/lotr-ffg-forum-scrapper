I guess I'm just not really angry about not being able to use Bombadil in other quests since the quest looks so good and works in campaign mode. However, I'm a firm believer in compatibility, and I HATE it when they make \"unique\" characters and objects as objectives or other quest-specific cards. I hate it. Treasures were already a big disappointment, I want a Sting attachment I can give Frodo or Bilbo in whatever quest I want, not just the Hobbit! The same goes for stuff like Anduril, which will most definately be a Boon card in the next saga. I think these cards really kill freedom of deckbuilding and compatibility since they're quest specific and cannot use them in our decks, and when we finally get an actual player card of that specific character/object, it creates even more trouble when playing it in the Saga. I wish we got all this stuff as PLAYER CARDS, not objectives, treasures, boons, whatever. \n\n \n\nI'm still really excited for this Barrow downs quest, and Bombadil at least has some justification to be a quest-specific card. The best of all, I think, is that we can play these quests in the Saga, which is great."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108823-am-i-the-only-person-excited-about-the-barrow-downs/?do=findComment&comment=1123706","commentId":1123706,"userName":"Vendictar","timestamp":1402972103,"content":"> Is it any more silly than eagles flying around in a mine, or Bilbo hanging out with Aragorn or any of the other millions of thematic inconsistencies?, recently there talk of putting more than 1 horse attachment on a hero, just one of many problesm.

To each their own, but for me, I think I found where the line is in terms of how much bending of theme and logic I am able to do for this game.

If I played the game a lot more, then I'd have more chance to try all the quests, so I think I'd be more excited for new quests, but I have yet to play more than 2/3 of the quests so far.\n\n \n\nIn all honesty, I'd be ok with not getting ANY more cards for a while because there are still so many decks and quests I want to try but will never get around to. The biggest reason I get excited about new cards is simply because they spoil them.\n\n \n\nI understand that comparitively I'm a casual gamer and FFG can't cater to people like me if they want to stay in business, and Caleb and co. would be sitting around doing nothing if they didn't keep releasing new content.\n\n \n\nAnyway, I guess I don't have a real good point to this post... just throwing out my thoughts.

Looks nice, but the movies have pretty much fixed \"Aragorn\" for me, and he looks nothing like the movie character, but instead some generic human.\n\n \n\n@booored:\n\n \n\nYeah, I also want the chapter packs to alternate between player cards and challenges. I base my purchases on the content of the player cards anyway. The game just progresses slow this way (though it's equally expensive)."}]}
