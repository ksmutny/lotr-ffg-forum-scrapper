And yes, you need the deluxe expansion to play each of its adventure packs. I recommend using hallofbeorn.com, cardgamedb.com or ringsdb,com  to see all the expansions listed with their respective cycles."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299892-new-player-how-do-i-know-what-sets-i-need-to-play-adventures-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3782429","commentId":3782429,"userName":"AllWingsStandyingBy","timestamp":1568172932,"content":"Thanks!\n\nWould I need any expansions other than the Core Set and the Deluxe Expansion to play the quests in the adventure packs within that Deluxe Expansion's cycle?\n\nThat is, I wouldn't need any earlier Deluxe Expansions or Adventure Packs to play through more recent Cycles, as long as I have all the adventures and the Deluxe expansion related to that cycle?\n\n\nThanks much!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299892-new-player-how-do-i-know-what-sets-i-need-to-play-adventures-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3782455","commentId":3782455,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1568177682,"content":"> 1 hour ago, AllWingsStandyingBy said:\n> \n> Thanks!\n> \n> Would I need any expansions other than the Core Set and the Deluxe Expansion to play the quests in the adventure packs within that Deluxe Expansion's cycle?\n> \n> That is, I wouldn't need any earlier Deluxe Expansions or Adventure Packs to play through more recent Cycles, as long as I have all the adventures and the Deluxe expansion related to that cycle?\n> \n> \n> Thanks much!\n> \n>  \n\nNope you are good to go as long as you get the deluxe for that cycle. I would recommend just grabbing whatever deluxe interests you and has the most adventure packs available. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299892-new-player-how-do-i-know-what-sets-i-need-to-play-adventures-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3785672","commentId":3785672,"userName":"PigsAreOurEquals","timestamp":1568550134,"content":"There is a community blog about playing quests with this set of cards: core+ deluxe.
