Maybe we should incorporate its rules... Also you need to define what the role of this deck is.. solo, 2player 3player 4 player.\n\n1) You may add cards until the deck is at 50.\n2) You may add only 1 card, but as many copies of it as rules allow\n3) After the deck is at 50 you have to remove cards to add cards\n4) You may JUST remove cards (change a card form 3 copies to 1 copies for example)\n5) You may JUST add xtra cards (change a card fro m1 copies to 3 copies (swap rule applys)\n6) You may add/change 1 hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57246-lets-build-a-leadershiptactics-deck/?do=findComment&comment=564800","commentId":564800,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1323199602,"content":" Yes.
