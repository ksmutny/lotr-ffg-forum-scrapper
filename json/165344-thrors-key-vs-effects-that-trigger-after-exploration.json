Thror's Key creates a constant effect that doesn't end until after the attached location is discarded whereas Ancient Mathom has a Response effect that triggers after the attached location leaves play. If you attached Thror's Key to Warg Lair, its only effect would be to prevent you from drawing a card when Warg Lair left play.\n> (French)\n\nEdited April 12, 2015 by alogos"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/165344-thrors-key-vs-effects-that-trigger-after-exploration/?do=findComment&comment=1562691","commentId":1562691,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1428858848,"content":">  \n> \n> I think it the same as when it leaves play, meaning Thror's key doesn't work against it.\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n\n \n\n \n\nalogos, do you mean to say that Thror's Key DOES work against it?  If it blanks out and prevents the card draw from Warg's Lair, would it not also blank out and prevent the threat raise from Ancient Causeway?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/165344-thrors-key-vs-effects-that-trigger-after-exploration/?do=findComment&comment=1563433","commentId":1563433,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1428873375,"content":"Oh... yeah, I didn't read that answer right (and it was my question to begin with)... ><\n\n \n\nSo yes, it should work."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/165344-thrors-key-vs-effects-that-trigger-after-exploration/?do=findComment&comment=1563504","commentId":1563504,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1428875094,"content":"Thanks for the help as always everyone!"}]}
