I think I got rules down ok. Been just playing the preconstructed stuff in core set to get used to cards. I have one question on attachments. I know in the planning phase it let's you play allies and attachments. Is there any other time I can play an attachment in any of the phases. I was wondering if I can play it during any of the action windows in the phases. I had an ungolian spawn engage me. At the end of the encounter phase you can play action. Was wondering if I can play a trap attachment on the spawn at that point. Thanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98033-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=967869","commentId":967869,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1391016205,"content":"No - attachments and allies only in the planning phase.\n\nÂ \n\nEvents in any action window (unless the card gives a more specific restriction, eg \"Combat Action\" or similar)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98033-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=967898","commentId":967898,"userName":"la1cajun","timestamp":1391018146,"content":"Ok, thanks!"}]}
