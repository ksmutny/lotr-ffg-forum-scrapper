Should I do it as one lot or sort out the expansions I have or...?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293061-getting-out/?do=findComment&comment=3662599","commentId":3662599,"userName":"icabod","timestamp":1553905972,"content":"There's a LOTR LCG Facebook group where I've seen people occasionally sell off their collections.
