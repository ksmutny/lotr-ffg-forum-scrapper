all Tolkien's works (not at all likely in Christopher Tolkien's lifetime).  Though we do have the advantage in this game of not being bound to any images in the movie, thankfully, so if they ever made the blue wizards they would certainly look like wizards with blue robes.\n\n \n\nAt the same time, I can't help be sad that their presence is precluded not really by copyright, but rather by fan attachment to names that they weren't actually known by.  The game could really use more Istari, and not just a hero Radagast.  What would be coolest is if they could get the rights to use Morinehtar and Romestamo, because then it would both be actual Tolkien names and also a thematic fit.\n\n \n\nI also think there's no good thematic reason to join the two wizards at the hip, just because they share a color.  The LOTR wiki suggests the etymology has Pallando connected with foresight and Alatar with trees(!).  Would I like an Istari with scrying powers and an Istari that boosts Ents?  Yes, yes I would.  Though if Alatar was the Radagast of plants, as the wiki suggests, its odd that Treebeard calls Gandalf \"the only wizard that cares about trees.\"  Then again, Treebeard might not have seen him in a few thousand years and assumes him dead.  Maybe he's hanging out with the Entwives.\n\n \n\nI can dream that the cycle taking us into the East runs into the other two wizards.  And finds the hidden location of the entwives, only to be sworn to secrecy so that the annoying menfolk won't show up...."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2308508","commentId":2308508,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1468440119,"content":"If

\"our forces\", and we both have him as an ally and also spent a cycle serving him.  And given the blue wizards went to Sauron-influenced territory, if they had raised armies they'd have no one to

distinctive colours.  Distinction was only required in the case of the three who remained in the relatively small area of the North-west.  (On the names see Q5.)  I really do not know anything clearly about the other two -- since they do not concern the history of the N.W.  I think they went as emissaries to distant regions, East and South, far out of Numenorean range: missionaries to 'enemy-occupied' lands, as it were.  What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.\n\n---\n\nAs you can see, this is far removed from the conception of Allatar and Pallando, joined-at-the-hip wizards who went East to fail.  Tolkien doesn't know the colors, doesn't know the names, doubts they have colours, has them possibly going different directions, thinks they failed but doesn't know it, but if they failed thinks they \"doubtless\" failed in different ways than Saruman.\n\n \n\nIn Unfinished Tales is printed an account of the Istari that mentions them, and \"was written, as it appears, in 1954\", so previous to the above-quoted letter.\n\n---\n\nOf this Order the number is unknown; but of those that came to the North of Middle-earth, where there was most hope...the chiefs were five.  The first to come was one of noble mien and bearing, with raven hair, and a fair voice, and he was clad in white; bearing, with raven hair, and a fair voice, and he was clad in white; great skill he had in works of hand and he was regarded by well-night all, even by the Eldar, as the head of the Order.  Others there were also: two clad in sea-blue, and one in earthenr brown; and last came one who seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-heared and grey-clad, and leaning on a staff....\n\n \n\nOf the Blue little was known in the West, and they had no names save Ithryn Luin 'the Blue Wizards'; for they passed into the East with Curunir, but they never returned, and whether they remained in the East, pursuing there the purposes for which they were sent; or perished, or as some hold were ensnared by Sauron and became his servants, is not now known.  But none of these chances were impossible to be....\n\n---\n\nA separate passage written in the margin of the 1954 story adds that of all the Istari \"one only remained faithful\" and explains about Radagast focusing on the beasts.  Obviously it's not necessary to become an enemy to the free peoples to become unfaithful to the errand.\n\n \n\nChristopher Tolkien also records in Unfinished Tales about an undated sketch of a narrative of a council held for selection of the Istari, where Alatar was sent by Orome, and Alatar took Pallando as a friend.  I would guess that this is later than the 1958 letter, but it is more consistent with the 1954 essay than the 1958 letter, so it could well be earlier.\n\n \n\nThe Unfinished Tales is much better known and read than The Letters of JRR Tolkien, which explains why the account there has dominated the conception of these two wizards.  However, according to the Tolkien wikis, in the last year of Tolkien's life he revisted these two wizards again (reference to Last Writings in \"The Peoples of Middle-earth\", which I don't own.)  This gives the names I had above, retcons their arrival to the second age with Glorfiendel, and is emphatic that they were on the side of the free peoples.  Their interference helped the Last Alliance succeed, and although they failed to find Sauron's hiding place after his defeat, they managed to cause lasting weakness and dissension that ultimately was critical to success at the end of the Third Age, as East and South contained many, many more people than those Southrons and Easterlings that Sauron was able to bring to fight against the free peoples.\n\n \n\nIn short, I don't think the blue wizards \"should\" be enemies instead of allies or heroes.  I think it also would be defensible to encounter them in our journeys East or South, and not to use the names they were known by in Valinor.  And I think it would be incredibly cool if that happened.  But I don't expect it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2308751","commentId":2308751,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1468448260,"content":"Sauron

But that would be boring.\n\nIf you confine yourself to the text of the Lord of the Rings (even including the appendices), you can't say that the blue wizards went into the East, nor even that they failed.  All that information is found only in writings outside the text, which you are apparently classifying as \"what an author intended to write\" instead of \"what they actually wrote\", despite the fact that the author did actually wrote it.  And the *most recent* writings on the subject of the two missing wizards by Tolkien indicated that they did not fail -- and also says their success is in reducing the number of men from those lands who marched against the West.  While Southrons and Easterlings were in large supply, they did not have enough men to conquer either Gondor or Dale.  Considering that on the map we have Rhun is much larger than Gondor and unbounded to the East, while Near Harad alone is of comparable size to Gondor and is known to extend far enough into the south to make the stars strange, there's no reason from the text to suppose Tolkien's late writings in this regard cannot be incorrect.\n\n \n\nThe Wose had a legitimate complaint against the Rohirrim, but appeared to have voluntarily withdrawn to Druadan rather than being dispossessed by Rohirrim -- they had no clue where the Pukel men were from.  In the event the Wose aligned themselves with the Free Peoples and rendered valuable service.\n\n \n\nThe Dunlending have more longstanding complaints against Rohan, and in the reign of Aldor the Old he \"drove out or subdued the last of the Dunlendish people that lingered East of Isen.\"  Folcwine is credited with \"reconquered the west-march (between Adorn and Isen) that Dunlendings had occupied\", the implication being that the Rohirrim had occupied it before.  In the war with Saruman, the Dunlendings came from west of the Isen, had not lived on Rohan's lands for at least 100 years, and from their false beliefs about how Rohirrim treated their enemies, it's clear that generation had no experience with the behavior of Rohan's warriors.\n\n \n\nBefore we get too misty-eyed about the poor Dunlendings forced off their land by the land-hungry Rohirrim, it's important to remember that Rohan was given their land not by right of conquest or colonization, but by grant from Gondor, the previous owner of the lands.  They were granted the land between Anduin and Isen (this would not include the west-march, but the appendices give no indication when this might have been originally conquered, nor by whom).  Gondor specifically granted it because it had been largely depopulated.  \"The people of that region had become few since the Plague, and most of those that remained had been slaughtered by the savage Easterlings.\"  The Dunlending center seemed to be (naturally enough) Dunland, and if their ancestral home was actual Rohan, it would be Gondor doing the dispossessing.  But Gondor's original borders included Dunland as well, making the Dunlendings subjects in either location, and there is no textual support for Gondor forcibly dispossessing either people.  Now in the canon of our game, the Dunlendings have been victimized by the free peoples, but that is FFG's addition, not something from the text itself.  In the text the wild men were amazed at the mercy of victorious Rohan and apparently were happy to take an oath preventing future bad behavior.\n\n \n\nWhat about the men of the south and east warring with Gondor even in Sauron's absence or destruction?  Sauron's \"absence\" did not amount to inactivity, and the implication in the appendices is that the malice of Sauron was behind the attacks from East, South, and also North.  As it says in Appendix A, \"It was in the reign of Araphant in the North and of Ondoher son of Calimehtar in the South that the two kingdoms again took counsel together after long silence and estrangement.  For at last they perceived that some single power and will was directing the assault from many quarters upon the survivors of Numenor.\"  It also says that the invasion of the wainriders was \"Stirred up, as was afterwards seen, by the emissaries of Sauron.\"\n\n \n\nGondor did expand both south and east, so that at its peak it extend to the sea of Rhun in the east and to Umbar in the south.  The wars with the east seem all to have been initiated by Easterling attacks, while the expansion south was driven by the ancient feud with the Black Numenoreans of Umbar.\n\n \n\nWhat about Gandalf's cunning plan to put Aragorn on the throne of Gondor, despite his questionable (descendant from an already-rejected claimant) claim?  Doesn't that show that he sought power, even though in the event Aragorn only reached the throne of Gondor *after* Gandalf's great labor of toppling Sauron had been accomplished?  For starters, we'd have to show that it was Gandalf's cunning plan, that he actually took steps to accomplish the cunning plan, and that he would derive substantial power from it being accomplished.  Trouble is, it was never Gandalf's plan in the first place.  It was Elrond's plan.  After Arwen had chosen Aragorn, Elrond made clear to his future son-in-law that \"she shall not be the bride of any Man less than the King of both Gondor and Arnor.\"  For his part, Aragorn seems to have had no intention of actually becoming king prior to the fall of Sauron.  After gaining great acclaim and influence as Thorongil, he left town rather than claim the throne from a steward who loved him very much, and even after displaying his standard he was loath to even enter the city.  For his part, Gandalf aided Aragorn's plan chiefly by working hard at the overthrow-of-Sauron thing, while using Aragorn to accomplish dangerous and thankless tasks with no direct connection to obtaining royalty.\n\n \n\nWhat about hanging about the two most powerful courts (presumably Rohan and Gondor)?  The text makes clear that in both places he only appeared in time of trouble, was frequently unappreciated, and certainly doesn't seem to have spent any effort in flattering the powers that be.  Cultivating Faramir, that \"wizard's pupil\" as a backup plan to Aragorn's kingship also fails on textual grounds -- in Faramir's account, \"I first saw [Gandalf] when I was a child, and he has been twice or thrice since then.\"  Faramir is a huge fan and calls him, accurately, \"a great mover of the deeds that are done in our time\" and says \"I learned a little of him, when he would teach (and that was seldom).\"  So a maximum of four contacts and only grudging instruction?  That's a miserable excuse for a power-seizing plan involving a man who was not in line to be the next Steward anyway.  Faramir is around 36 at the time, so Gandalf is showing up at the most powerful court in middle earth about once per decade.  A slim reed indeed to rest claims that Gandalf is just seeking power in a different way than Saruman, let alone to claim on that limited sample that it is \"the nature of their kind\"!\n\n \n\nSince both Tolkien's early writings and later writings about the blue wizards are extra-canonical, you are free to prefer the earlier writings and even interpret it along your conception of how Maiar inevitably behave, except for Radagast.  However, I cannot adopt your view of Maiar and reconcile it with the text of the LOTR, and I find Tolkien's latest conception of the wizards to be consistent with the text of LOTR, more definite than his early writings considering their fate, more interesting, and more likely to produce amazing content for this game.  I think it's a shame that the wider propagation of his earlier writings on the wizards will likely preclude that from happening.  As always, YMMV."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2309636","commentId":2309636,"userName":"JJ48","timestamp":1468502093,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > Sauron and Gandalf are both Maiar that raise armies and vie for dominance over Middle Earth.

\n>  \n> \n> Put it this way, if Gandalf's aim was to not raise armies and crush his enemies, he did a spectacularly bad job of it.\n> \n>  \n\nYes, the Istari are a specially selected group of Maiar, chosen by the Valar, given bodies, and sent to middle earth to oppose Sauron.  Sauron is also a Maiar.  All the Istari are from a group of Maiar serving the Valar, of which only one (Saruman) is known to have sought personal dominance over middle earth.  Sauron is the most prominent of a group of Maiar serving Melkor, of which only one (Sauron) is known to have sought personal dominance over middle earth.  Bombadil also appears to be a Maiar never in active service to the Valar or Melkor, and while Bombadil is a pretty unique fellow, he's not alone in that description either (Melian also fits).  Neither he nor Melian ever sought personal dominance over middle earth.  Your general rule has a startling lack of examples.\n\n \n\nDurin's Bane is clearly deferred to by the orcs of Moria (with good reason), but it is not clear that he orders them in any fashion, or had any hand in assembling them.  Durin's Bane was hiding out when the dwarves uncovered him, very far from seeking dominance.  Once in possession of Moria, he did nothing with it as far as we can tell.  The Dwarf/Goblin war was orchestrated by Azog, who the orcs of Moria clearly *did* take orders from, and in the Hobbit the Goblins take orders from the Great Goblin and Bolg, respectively.  There's no textual evidence that any of the Misty Mountains goblins outside of their range are operating under orders from Durin's Bane, nor does he do anything to expand Moria's influence during the many centuries he was unopposed there.\n\n \n\nGandalf's lack of a permanent power base shows that he is not in any way seeking (or achieving) personal dominance, as Faramir perceived, he is a mover of others and his power is largely confined to that.  Others assemble and command the armies, others acquire power as a result of Gandalf's meddling and have the freedom of action to use it how they will.  It's not just a different style than Saruman's approach, it's a different thing all together, and the goal is simply and solely the overthrow of Sauron.  The only time his power is actually augmented is when he is returned to life as Gandalf the White, and that was not a turn of events Gandalf either sought or anticipated.\n\n \n\nHis \"significant history\" in the courts of Rohan and Gondor in the text amount to a maximum of four visits during Faramir's lifetime to Gondor prior to the War of the Ring, neither seeking nor gaining influence from Denethor, and at least one visit to Theoden's court prior to the War of the Ring, the last obtaining Shadowfax but incurring ill will from the King.\n\n \n\nIn the council of Elrond, it is Elrond who conducts and presides, and Elrond who accepts Frodo as the ringbearer and charges him.  Elrond defers to Gandalf only in the selection of Merry and Pippin for the fellowship, but it is again Elrond ultimately making the decision.  Gandalf and Glorfindel flank Elrond at the dinner, but from the text I think it more likely that Glorfindel is on the right -- not that it amounts in the least to either seeking or receiving power.  Elrond was one person who needed no moving to oppose the designs of Sauron.\n\n \n\nThe protection of heirs of Arnor and the long-planned Return of the King are intimately connected with Elrond, not Gandalf.  It is Elrond who protects and houses the heirs, it is Elrond who tells him his heritage and give shim the ring of Barahir and the shards of Narsil.  It is Elrond who gives Aragorn the charge to become king of Gondor and Arnor.  Gandalf's specific involvement in the return of the king, aside from endangering Aragorn's life in difficult and largely unpublicized tasks, is constricted to finding a shoot of the White Tree.  Denethor's paranoia is ill-founded.\n\n \n\nThere's no evidence that Gandalf or anyone in Arnor had anything to do with inventing or spreading the \"hands of the healer\" legend.  Ioreth was wishing for a King of Gondor, not Arnor, and there's no reason to suppose it originates from anything other than the healing capabilites of long-ago kings of Gondor.  The lore master's doggerel about Athelas also mentions the king's hand.\n\n \n\nNor is there much of a contrast between Aragorn and the brothers in the healing department.  Aragorn had already put on some dramatic \"public displays\", what with winning two battles, saving the day, and displaying the royal banner.  But he went to the house of healing *at night*, cloaked and bearing no token other than his elf-stone, explicitly saying that he is only entering because Gandalf begged him to, and only as Captain of the Dunedain of Arnor.  Gandalf repeats Ioreth's saying, but the audience is Eomer, Imrahil, and Aragorn, all well aware of Aragorn's claim and already accepting it.  In the presence of Ioreth and the lore master, Aragorn does not identify himself and is called \"your lordship\" and \"a captain of war\".  Ioreth doesn't realize who it is until the awakened Faramir spills the beans by calling him King -- and Ioreth being Ioreth, it quickly gets around.  After his initial praise of Ioreth, Gandalf takes no hand at all in identifying or publicizing Aragorn's true identity.  For his part, Aragorn sends word to the brothers to come help him, laboring into the night, and leaving under cloak of darkness.  With his banner furled, the good citizens of Minas Tirith \"wondered if the coming of the King had been but a dream.\"\n\n \n\nIf Peter Jackson perceived that Gandalf's actions or motivations were not selfless or benevolent, that's hardly evidence that it was true.  Jackson did extreme violence to the characters of LOTR at his whim.  What he did to Faramir was appalling.\n\n \n\nYes, the ring was a trap, and Gandalf wisely feared -- as did Elrond at the council and Galadriel when freely offered the ring.  But if your motivation is \"dominance over middle earth\", the ring is *not* a trap.  It would accomplish exactly that in the hand of the powerful.  But dominance was not sought or desired by Gandalf, who pitied the slaves of Sauron.  He laid out his motivations clearly to Denethor, even though that paranoid worthy didn't believe him.  \"Unless the king should come again?  Well, my lord Steward, it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event, which few now look to see.  In that task you shall have all the aid that you are pleased to ask for.  But I will say this:  the rule of no realm is mine, neither of Gondor nor any other, great or small.  But all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands, those are my care.  And for my part, I shall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come.  For I also am a steward.  Did you not know?\"\n\n \n\nGandalf did not raise or lead armies himself, though he aided others in doing so.  But that was not his goal, and he could succeed at his goal without crushing his enemies.  Indeed, he knew there was no hope at all of crushing his enemies.  He made that abundantly clear in the last debate.\n\n \n\n\"Victory cannot be achieved by arms, whether you sit here to endure siege after siege, or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the River.\"  Naturally he counsels them to march out to be overwhelmed beyond the River.  \"We must walk open-eyed into that trap, with courage, but small hope for ourselves.  For my lords, it may well prove that we ourselves shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if Barad-dur be thrown down, we shall not live to see a new age.  But this, I deem, is our duty.  And better so than to perish nonetheless--as we surely shall, if we sit here--and know as we die that no new age shall be.\"\n\n \n\nI find this utterly irreconcilable to a thesis that seeking power and dominance is just something that Maiar naturally do, except for Radagast.  And when Gandalf's designs were accomplish and Sauron was overthrown, with the rule of Gondor and Arnor committed to his good friend Aragorn, Gandalf retired from his labors, not even bothering to help the hobbits scour the shire, just marking the time until he could go home.\n\n \n\nMotivation is in the eye of the beholder, so YMMV.  But in my eyes, your generalization about Maiar does Jackson-like violence to what I see in the text."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2309800","commentId":2309800,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1468508097,"content":">

The bearded Easterlings with Axes who took part in the Battle of Pelennor Fields might have been these guys. You then have the remains of the Wainriders who are a nomadic steppes culture living in large caravans. Then there are the remains of the Balchoth who I've seen some people posit as a Mongol type culture living in Yurts.

That Archer is great with Celeborn, especially when you can spam him mid-round with The Tree People. But as is, a 2 cost 2 attack Leadership ally (not to mention Silvan, so 1 cost) is nuts. Love this card.\n\n \n\nBounder, 1) reminds me of an old LOTR TCG card from the first set, the Bounder who gets his head cut off by a Nazgul for nothing during Frodo's and Gandalf's conversation in FOTR, 2) has one of my favorite arts as of late, and 3) is really **** good! Any side quest deck will want x3 of this guy. Now that I think of it, the great thing about the side quest mechanic is that you only need 1 side quest in the victory display to trigger all your effects, from which this Bounder seems like one of the best.\n\n \n\nSadly I'm not sure about The Road Goes Ever On and On. It's an iconic song and theme of the books, but I just think that any side quest deck will already run Dúnedain Message or Thurindir anyway both of which are much easier. Now granted I don't think we have a new side quest Leadership ally, so maybe Leadership would be kind of wasted, but I still think it'd be playable in a side quest deck without Leadership if it attached to a location instead. You'll want your side quest effects before even defeating the first stage in many scenarios. And if you're going to attach this to a side quest you or your partner already played, then what's the urgency of getting another one? All your side quest effects will already be playable. Maybe for that +1 wp on Thurindir? Or 1 more damage from Dour Handed? Not sure if convinced.\n\n \n\nJohn Constantine convinced me of the value of Erebor Guard. At first I was really meh about it but yeah, in a Caldara deck he's great It's another way like Emery to discard stuff from your deck, and you want to get Prince Imrahil into the discard ASAP, so now I really like him.\n\n \n\n@John Constantine, In a silvan deck the archer is fine if you have Galadriel with Nenya and no Unexpected. Draw and reduce, then ready to add 4 to the quest. I still think his greatest asset is his 2 attack though.\n\nEdited October 14, 2016 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2457499","commentId":2457499,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1476473488,"content":"Quick review:\n\n \n\nGreenwood Archer.\n\nWeird. Not only because a hero rarely needs to be readied during the planning phase (I do realize he is supposed to be put into play by various game effects, yet still it is usually good to have an application for the card it is played in usual way), but also because none of the currently existing Leadership heroes possess any pritned self-exhausting ability, so this needs to be multisphered into something at the very least. But I like the concept.\n\n \n\n \n\nErebor Guard.\n\nSuper awesum. 2 cost 0/1/2/3 is incredible. It also fuels dwarven mill and Caldara alike. And it is also a body that costs 4 which you play for 2, which means a huge Very Good Tale potential when crossed with Leadership.\n\n \n\n \n\nHalfling Bounder.\n\nThe encounter deck controls are real. Soon, poor encounter deck will be getting any 'when revealed' effect it'll try to sneak in showed into it's mouth. Good standard stats 1/1/0/2 make this a decent deel, a better deal if you actually run a side quest setup, and even more better deal if you'll actually manage to clear one of them :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\n \n\nWell Warned.\n\nThreat reduction for nothing, what more can you ask for?

How much side quests can you realistically clear without severely hindering your effort on the main one? I find a cost of 1 to be strange, especially when it limits the range of possible targets to the ones engaged with you. There is Goblin-cleaver which does 2-3 damage for 0 by merely exhausting a weapon, and equipping a weapon is far more easily done than clearing a side-quest.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe Road Goes Ever On.\n\nAll hail the first official Lore Song!

Even in Noldor this isn't good as you want to discard cards from your hand not from the top of your deck. Defensive allies with 2 or less defense usually aren't worth it in my opinion if they don't have some killer ability on top. This guy is good in a dedicated dwarf mill deck or Caldara deck but looks super average in other decks.\n\n \n\nHalfling bounder is the best of the lot. We finally have an ally that be discarded in an emergency to cancel the when revealed effects of an encounter card. He also has 2 hitpoints which means he will hopefully stick around till you need that ability and 1/1 (in willpower and attack) is not bad for two cost especially in lore. It also makes him valuable until you need to/are able to use his cancel effect which means he doesn't just sit around until you need his ability. You do need a sidequest in the victory display but this isn't too hard to achieve even using decks that only feature a few sidequests as there are plenty of cards to fetch them. As others have mentioned he is a boss in the Lost Realm/Angmar cycle because of encounter side quests. I really love this ally but wish this ability had been on a dunedain or noldor ally. Then again we did get Dunedain Lookout (or whatever he is called) that can cancel the when revealed effects on an enemy so I guess we sort of did and I am being extremely picky :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nWell Warned is pretty decent... I like that it can be used on any player. Noble and Scout isn't too hard to achieve. I think for me the annoying thing with these cards that need two traits is that some of them will be great for our decks but we wont have the traits (on heroes at least) to play them right away or as consistently as we'd like so we have to consider whether there are enough allies with the trait you need included in your deck to cover the fact you don't have that trait on a hero or if it is worth changing our decks just to include these. I know that really if anything this opens up deckbuilding and strategy further but its going to be frustrating to see cards that could be really great in your decks but require you to potentially change your hero lineup for them to be viable. I guess this is true of just about any card though (you need Galadriel for her mirror don't you!) so I am being a little silly. Zero cost for a bit of threat reduction is always nice and unlike Elrond's Counsel this can be used on any player.\n\n \n\nDour Handed outside of a dedicated side quest deck (which I realise is going to be the new type of deck) seems useless and while there are always plenty of niche cards it would nice if it wasn't a completely dead card without having several side quests in the victory display. Even with 2 or even maybe 3 side quests in the victory display this is still only doing 2 to 3 direct damage for 1 cost. Like John said compare this to Goblin Cleaver which does 2/3 damage for 0 and just requires a weapon attachment which is like a million times easier than clearing a sidequest. Almost all other direct damage cards seem better than this one for some reason.\n\nThe Road Goes Ever on is sort of like Dunedain Message but for 0 cost in lore. It does let any player search for a side quest not just the player using it which is better than Message. It does only trigger when you beat the quest it is attached to though and therein lies what I think is the massive restriction to this card. So you want to play side quests as early as possible so you can clear them and receive their effects (especially these new ones that provide a constant effect for the rest of the game) to advance your board state. This card only lets you go and get a side quest once you clear a quest stage already in play. Admittedly this can be used on another side quest (which is the optimal use it seems) but if there isn't already a side quest in play this has to be put on the main quest and you might not see its effect for several turns. I used to use The Long Defeat which I thought was a really cool card but in practise was just so extremely hit and miss and I think this card is just like The Long Defeat in that regard. In a side quest deck it might be good just so you can chain side quests together and try to keep one in play consistently to help cards like East Road Ranger though I guess.\n\nAdmittedly I am usually slow to see cool combos or interactions with new player cards and am also overly harsh with my opinion of them and gradually warm up or change my opinion over time but some of these are really average to me.

That Archer is great with Celeborn, especially when you can spam him mid-round with The Tree People. But as is, a 2 cost 2 attack Leadership ally (not to mention Silvan, so 1 cost) is nuts. Love this card.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Bounder, 1) reminds me of an old LOTR TCG card from the first set, the Bounder who gets his head cut off by a Nazgul for nothing during Frodo's and Gandalf's conversation in FOTR, 2) has one of my favorite arts as of late, and 3) is really **** good! Any side quest deck will want x3 of this guy. Now that I think of it, the great thing about the side quest mechanic is that you only need 1 side quest in the victory display to trigger all your effects, from which this Bounder seems like one of the best.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Sadly I'm not sure about The Road Goes Ever On and On. It's an iconic song and theme of the books, but I just think that any side quest deck will already run Dúnedain Message or Thurindir anyway both of which are much easier. Now granted I don't think we have a new side quest Leadership ally, so maybe Leadership would be kind of wasted, but I still think it'd be playable in a side quest deck without Leadership if it attached to a location instead. You'll want your side quest effects before even defeating the first stage in many scenarios. And if you're going to attach this to a side quest you or your partner already played, then what's the urgency of getting another one? All your side quest effects will already be playable. Maybe for that +1 wp on Thurindir? Or 1 more damage from Dour Handed? Not sure if convinced.\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n\nI like both the Bounder (obviously) and the Song. My side quest deck is Beorn Rossiel Thurundir right now and it fits perfectly. I am not sure about the number. I probably only start with one as the slots get ever so precious but, it will still be a good card to draw, I feel. I almost always mulligan for a side quest, in order to have two to begin with. And then when you have the Road Goes Ever On, it should become a free card, the cost of 0 is really nice here.\n\n \n\nBy the way, I am not sure I saw it mentioned, have others include the Long Defeat in their side quests decks? Seems like a particularly useful opening card there, especially with Thurundir (I know I may be in minority playing the unreleased cards, but still). [edit] I just saw Psychorocka describing his negative experience with the card, I think this may change for you with Thurundir, it certainly did for me once I got the ranger on board.\n\n \n\nMirkwood Archer is alright I feel. It doesn't particularly scream for its place in my Galadhrim deck but it will probably make it. Is good if you have Nenya on Galadriel, or if in your other deck is someone like Denethor, Beravor or Elrond.\n\n \n\nI have not yet tried the Dwarf discard deck but I am aware it is getting ever more intriguing. Zigil Miner currently sides with the Noldor, though.\n\n \n\nWell Warned seems ok, though feels best paired with the Hobbits (Smoke Rings) who might have a hard time finding a Noble and a Scout among them.\n\n \n\nMore direct damage is nice but you really have to commit to the strategy and then still it only works against particular quests. Not sure I will play this any time soon.\n\nEdited October 15, 2016 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2458218","commentId":2458218,"userName":"dr00","timestamp":1476518205,"content":"> Yay for more cancellation.

We finally have an ally that be discarded in an emergency to cancel the when revealed effects of an encounter card. He also has 2 hitpoints which means he will hopefully stick around till you need that ability and 1/1 (in willpower and attack) is not bad for two cost especially in lore. It also makes him valuable until you need to/are able to use his cancel effect which means he doesn't just sit around until you need his ability. You do need a sidequest in the victory display but this isn't too hard to achieve even using decks that only feature a few sidequests as there are plenty of cards to fetch them. As others have mentioned he is a boss in the Lost Realm/Angmar cycle because of encounter side quests. I really love this ally but wish this ability had been on a dunedain or noldor ally. Then again we did get Dunedain Lookout (or whatever he is called) that can cancel the when revealed effects on an enemy so I guess we sort of did and I am being extremely picky :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n> \n>  \n> \n> Well Warned is pretty decent... I like that it can be used on any player. Noble and Scout isn't too hard to achieve. I think for me the annoying thing with these cards that need two traits is that some of them will be great for our decks but we wont have the traits (on heroes at least) to play them right away or as consistently as we'd like so we have to consider whether there are enough allies with the trait you need included in your deck to cover the fact you don't have that trait on a hero or if it is worth changing our decks just to include these. I know that really if anything this opens up deckbuilding and strategy further but its going to be frustrating to see cards that could be really great in your decks but require you to potentially change your hero lineup for them to be viable. I guess this is true of just about any card though (you need Galadriel for her mirror don't you!) so I am being a little silly.

Lucky I love the new heroes so much!\n\ni know you've started to change your mind on Greenwood Archer, but it seems a lot of the criticisms are 'this card doesn't work well outside of the deck it was designed to work in, therefore it's not a good card', and i honestly can't disagree more.\n\njust because a card doesn't have universal appeal doesn't mean it's a bad card. as i mentioned above, Greenwood Archer is great in Silvan decks. but outside of that, he's also a 2 for 2 ranged attacker in Leadership of all things. he could have a blank ability, and i'd consider him pretty useful tbh.\n\nErebor Guard's ability of discarding outside of intentional self-mill isn't that much of a problem tbh, because you're discarding two cards that may as well have been on the bottom of your deck. 2 resources for a 2def 3hp sentinel, in Spirit of all things, is pretty solid imo. it's just that his 'downside' is a potential gain when you build your deck for Hidden Caches, Caldara discard spam, etc.\n\nas for Dour-handed, i think it's kind of an unknown. it'll likely get a lot better in multiplayer with many different side quests entering the victory display, and as you said, only really useful in a dedicated side quest deck, but even then, how many side quests can you really get in a deck that's packing Tactics? Delay the Enemy isn't very good tbh. Keep Watch is a lot better, but limit 1 in the victory display.\n\nyou'll likely want to go dual or trisphere to get enough side quests, and then how is Dour-handed going to fit into the deck anyway? i actually think it's a terrible card in that i doubt i'd ever find it useful, wished i had put it in my deck instead, and i think i'll likely find many instances where i wished i had a different direct damage event instead.\n\nEdited October 15, 2016 by dr00"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2458231","commentId":2458231,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1476519374,"content":"Just to comment on a few sentiments above.

Indeed, you cannot progress to stage 2 without all players being entirely free of engaged enemies. The same is true for the final stage -  victory cannot occur until all players are free of engaged enemies. The quest stages do not permit over-questing; that is to say they are capped, so you can't stockpile a reserve of progress tokens. Furthermore, the quest has numerous ways of removing progress tokens. Losing progress tokens combined with having to be entirely free of engaged enemies can make completing a stage tricky. If you read the most recent preview article, you also know that the Objective card, Seize Them, will cause you to auto-lose the game if no progress has been placed on the main quest during a round. There are some encounter side quests to contend with as well. As Bullroarer mentioned above, Archery is abundant.\n\n \n\nI played 2 handed against the quest with a Dunedain/Trap deck (Haldir/Damrod/Amartheul) and a Doomed/Beefy Ally deck (Denethor/Erestor/Loragorn). I went into the quest entirely blind, but found those decks to be relatively effective against it. Hitting Valor via the Doomed deck (Legacy of Numenor and Deep Knowledge) can allow the Dunedain deck to sweep the board free of enemies in one turn via a Valorous Hour of Wrath. Amartheul blocks with Protector of Lorien and Destrier to aid against shadow cards. Boosted Haldir (Ranger Spear, Dunedain Mark, Rivendell Blade) and Amartheul can often kill all the enemies in one fell swoop. I've played the quest twice so far. I believe I won the first time, but may have overlooked some card effects, so I played it again tonight and won via Hour of Wrath. The quest is fun; it does a good job of creating a chase scene as the encounter deck has numerous ways of forcing you to engage enemies (Locations play a part in evoking a chase-like feel as well). The art and mechanics of the Harad (Southrons) is quite reminiscent of Into Ithilien, which I just happened to play within the last week. Enjoying the box so far!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2514137","commentId":2514137,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1480004074,"content":"RobOz covered it pretty well. The quest is challenging to be sure and I don't think people will be saying it's not worthy of being a DL5.\n\nTwo stages, each requiring 15 progress, but not only are there cards that remove progress, there are other conditions that prevent you from advancing. Additionally, the quest cards cannot have more than 15 progress on them. So you can't overstock the quest card. As an example, on the last turn I played Gandalf (core) and made a massive push towards the finish line. The board was clear. Revealed \"Nowhere to Hide\" which makes me put an enemy into play engaged with me by flipping cards from the encounter deck. I flipped Southron Archer, archery 2 and the forced effect of either remove two progress from the quest or discard an ally you control. Of course it was Gandalf and luckily I was able to place the 15 progress.\n\nBut you can't win the last stage if an enemy is engaged with you. I was able to ready the Three Hunters through various effects and dispatch the Archer for the win, threat at 46.

I think the theme is quite solid. As he indicated, the quest begins immediately after the conclusion of City of the Corsairs. Narrow Alleyway was one of my favorite cards in the encounter deck. It grants a previously unseen positive effect for a location which later has a drawback. Furthermore, the card is not plentiful, so you have to decide whether you want to use it quickly or save it for an enemy you deem worse. The location cards generally operate on the chase theme when they become the active location - some sort of mechanic will trigger that forces you to engage enemies or remove progress from the main quest. One of the encounter side quests has some new tricks to it as well. Thankfully, I managed to avoid it in the two games I played.\n\n \n\nThe quest concludes with the heroes fleeing out the gates of Umbar and into the desert. That scene segues right into the second quest, which I have not played yet. I usually try to win about 3 games against a non-brutal quest, so I'll likely try Escape from Umbar a couple more times before moving on to Desert Crossing (Quest #2). I did glimpse briefly at the encounter cards for Desert Crossing; the desert-themed artwork looked great! As I mentioned in an earlier post, I was oddly ambivalent about the Harad cycle despite being tolerant of the designers forays into material that could be deemed un-thematic or not holding true to Middle Earth lore. But as I sifted through the encounter cards for Sands, I found myself feeling pretty motivated to play the quests.\n\n \n\nJust glanced very briefly at The Long Arm of Mordor. It seems to continue the escape/travel theme by having the heroes make their way toward a jungle. I could see this cycle being the reverse of Dream-chaser. In that cycle we were the pursuers. In this, we appear to be the pursued.\n\n \n\nI got the distinct sense that Matt and Caleb have decided to more strongly connect the narrative for the Deluxe cycles (as we saw at the end of Angmar Awakened and beginning of Dream-chaser). The beginning of Sands certainly seems to continue this approach.

The quest is exactly what it says it is; a classic desert trek. Think Dune or Athas (if you're familiar with the Dungeons and Dragons Dark Sun setting). Players must deal with the Temperature mechanic (as revealed in an earlier preview article), desert creatures, desert features (locations) and weather treacheries that play off the desert setting and the Temperature mechanic.

I avoided the smattering of encounter side quests in my play-through of Desert Crossing. Hitting one or more of these side quests would have really screwed me up.

That seems super boring and out of place for the Harad cycle.\n\nDon't get me wrong I totally get where you are coming from and understand but I feel completely different.\n\nThe feel of the encounter cards in this deluxe (especially the locations and treacheries) is very different from what we normally receive especially the art. We see all sorts of interesting new effects such as the temperature and objective hero mechanics, willpower of defenders now mattering in certain quests which is a cool alternative to making them actually defend using their willpower like in the stone of erech, we see enemy mounts that become their own enemy once the rider is defeated, locations that discard the top card of the encounter deck and only add it to staging depending if its an enemy or location, we even get an enemy that you cannot declare defenders against which is something really neat and new. \n\nI see where you are coming from in regards to the Orcs but I mean in the end they are ultimately Sauron's main type of warrior and follower. He literally has legions and legions of Orcs but somewhat limited amounts of any other fighter. Even during The War of the Ring he may have Haradrim and Umbar armies fighting for him but they are vastly outnumbered by the legions of Orcs he had. Harad is also pretty close to Mordor so it makes sense that it would be crawling with orcs and various servants or spies of the Dark Lord. I do agree it would have been great to see the \"half-trolls\" of Far Harad or something similar. \n\nI feel like orcs definitely aren't \"out of place\" in this cycle considering its proximity to Mordor and the fact the vast majority of Sauron's forces were in fact orcs/goblins/uruks. I do totally agree that it would be nice to see some other new enemies and I hope that we do in fact see some in the last few AP's. We haven't seen spiders in forever either so as much as yes we have seen lots of them in the past we haven't seen them in a while so it is still something different from the last few cycles (no spiders since the first cycle and second cycles if you don't include Saga quests)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2521318","commentId":2521318,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1480557332,"content":"We saw spiders in Heirs too, and a very scary one at that.\n\n \n\nI understand that some people do like orcs a lot so this makes them happy I guess.

Well, yeah, the idea is cool but really not that different from previous enemy attachments (e.g. for the Nazguls), is it?\n\nI haven't actually received and played the deluxe box yet so what I have to say is purely based off the spoilers and not experience. \n\n1) well it seems like you can't lower temperature in any way whatsoever and if it gets to a certain level you lose so that is pretty different from threat which can be lowered or raised. If anything it is more of a strict timer (that cannot be reduced) and if anything I would say it is far more similar to time counters than it is to threat. \n\n \n\n2) I would imagine that the Objective heroes also generate resources? Could be wrong here as again I dont have the box yet im just going off spoilers but I imagine they generate resources and can pay for neutral cards (or maybe even cards of any sphere?). It seems as though you start the third quest off with all your heroes captured and with only an objective hero under your control so surely they generate resources? I guess they aren't THAT different from objective allies but they do have some really cool abilities and art so to me they are definitely different enough to be interesting and exciting.\n\n \n\n3) it isnt THAT different but at the same time it does operate in a very different manner to \"nazgul\" or \"condition\" attachments that enemies can receive in a few ways. First off if there are no nazgul in play the nazgul attachments simply whiff, this card will still enter play as its own enemy if there are no orcs in play. Once you destroy a nazgul the attachments are discarded as well, if you destroy the attached orc enemy the warg becomes its own foe that you still have to deal with. Its the same concept (enemy attachments/mounts) but done in a very different and new way. I for one think the design on this card is absolutely incredible and I cannot wait to see what its like during actual gameplay. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2521348","commentId":2521348,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1480559287,"content":"> We saw spiders in Heirs too, and a very scary one at that.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I understand that some people do like orcs a lot so this makes them happy I guess.

Overall, I thought it was fantastic and I give the box a 5/5. The player cards are interesting and fun to use, but not overpowered. I thoroughly enjoyed every quest, and even though I just went through them I find myself wanting to play each of them again. I think part of that is due to the existence of the side quests which can give you a unique experience depending on which ones show up (Southron Champion came up for me, and I loved taking that guy down).\n\n \n\nSpoilers:\n\n \n\nFor all the quests, I thought they really nailed the theme. I felt like I was being chased, then dying of thirst, then overrun with orcs. I think the effects on the final boss, the Uruk Chieftian, is quite brilliant. It definitely feels like some boss is sending his underlings ahead of him to weaken you before dealing with you himself. I think the designers are getting much smarter with their boss battles lately (Sahir from City of Corsairs was another mechanic I liked) to make the fights challenging, while not simply stacking the boss with a million hit points and making him immune to everything.\n\n \n\nFor the Long arm of Mordor - I think this is the best \"captured\" mechanic they've come up with so far. I didn't feel utterly crippled with a useless hand from the get-go. I think this is thanks to the \"no resource match required for the first card played\" effect.\n\n \n\n \n\n> I would really like to hear other players opinions on this. For me, playing solo, the first quest is the hardest by far.\n\n \n\nActually, the first quest was my only loss, and it was on turn 1 because I flipped up something with high threat and didn't make any progress despite questing with everyone. In terms of difficulty, I thought all the quests were pretty even. Some could be easier or harder depending on your deck type. Bringing a major turtle deck to Escape from Umbar wouldn't go over well, while I could see a high willpower deck cruising through it more easily.\n\nEdited December 3, 2016 by Seastan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2524906","commentId":2524906,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1480782298,"content":"Well, I thought I couldn't be more hyped, but I am."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2524924","commentId":2524924,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1480783459,"content":"Played Escape From New York Umbar last night with 4 players.

Quick thoughts:\n\n \n\nEscape from Umbar: Managed to win this quest on the first try, but suspect this is the most difficult in the box.\n\nDesert Crossing: Thought it was one of the more successful wilderness travel quests in the game.\n\nLong Arm of Mordor: Most difficult of the three quests for me personally, but probably not as hard as Escape from Umbar. Agree with Seastan's assessment that it's the best of the the three prisoner quests (Escape from Dol Guldor, Escape from Mount Gram), particularly because it doesn't totally hamstring the player(s). I thought Mount Gram was also a solid prisoner quest, but this quest is not nearly as finicky to set up. I also found the rescuing mechanic to be well-executed. It's challenging to deal with, but simple to understand. The \"first card played each phase does not require a resource match\" was also well done, as it provides the players options despite missing their heroes. Also really liked the Objective heroes. They definitely felt more interesting to use than Objective allies.\n\n \n\nI thought the box did a solid job of providing us three engaging quests without a lot of overhead to manage. The busiest quest to me was the first, as a large amount of enemies can make it onto the board. The other two were pretty easy to work with from a board management/clutter standpoint. Additionally, I enjoyed the encounter side quests because there were fewer of them and they were not nearly as brutal as the Lost Realm cycle. To me, that provided for more variable and interesting game play. While I liked the Lost Realm encounter side quests, I thought many of them were so overwhelming as to be mandatory. Finally, I enjoyed the story presented in the quests and the rules insert, particularly as it fed into the final quest and its conclusion. I am definitely excited to play the first AP!\n\nEdited December 3, 2016 by RobOz"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2525277","commentId":2525277,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1480810088,"content":"mandatory 2 ez w8 4 n1hgtm4r3 post conf1rm3d"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224887-the-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2525569","commentId":2525569,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1480835519,"content":"Played through the box today, first quest 3 player and the next two quests 4 player.  Won the first two quests on the first try, but I thoroughly enjoyed them and it was a tough fight.  The progress mechanic on the first quest was a lot of fun, and the temperature mechanic is a slick way to ramp difficulty and apply a time pressure.\n\n \n\nThe third quest though, Long Arm of Mordor...
