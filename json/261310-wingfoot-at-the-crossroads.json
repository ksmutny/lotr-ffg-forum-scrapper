Wingfoot work this way: when you reveal the named type you ready.

If it were truly a passive effect that, once a specified card type has been revealed, constantly readies the character every time it's exhausted, then you'd be able to use some character powers infinitely which is obviously not going to be right. And it isn't a once-only effect because I think it has been clarified in the past that Ranger Eleanor can cancel multiple treacheries per round with Wingfoot."}]}
