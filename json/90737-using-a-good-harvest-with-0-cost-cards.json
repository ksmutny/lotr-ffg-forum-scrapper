But Caleb change his mind alraeady couple of times about other things so let him think a bit more and who know....?\n\n \n\nSame loragorn +desperade alliance. This will be too broken and with new Doom player cards from Isengard expansion will be crazy powerful.  He will change his mind i suppose."}]}
