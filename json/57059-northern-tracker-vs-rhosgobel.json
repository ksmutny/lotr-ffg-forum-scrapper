So, I guess exploring Rhosgobel as fast as possible is no problem."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57059-northern-tracker-vs-rhosgobel/?do=findComment&comment=563658","commentId":563658,"userName":"Vase","timestamp":1322997171,"content":" There are always those games where, even though you have 3 Norther Trackers in your deck, they somehow all manage to be clear at the bottom and you never draw one.  \n\nBut without even being so extreme, if you don't get to play Northern Tracker until, say, round 3, it is probably already too late to let the card run its course for 4 rounds to get rid of Rhosgobel for you.  In my opinion, it still takes some other planning and resourcefulness...so yay for this game.  "}]}
