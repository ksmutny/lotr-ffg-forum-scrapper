Vilya allows you to either play the card for no cost, hence X equals 0, or put it at the bottom of the deck. So you can't optionally add two resources to pay for the Warden, since Vilya either plays the card at 0 cost or not at all.  It's not a normal play of a card, so it limits what you can do. Of course, I may well be off here: other people's thoughts?"}]}
