Or is it just one if players draw simultaniously. Because Hithaeglir Foothills has no cap for instance,when we played it forced the threat in the staging area up to almost twenty, while Stage 3 had another activate location in play so we couldn't travel there, and we were way too burdened with enemies to quest all out. Bit broken if so. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126186-after-a-player-draws-any-number-of-cards-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=1319228","commentId":1319228,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1414894210,"content":"Yes, it'll trigger separately for each player during the resource phase.  Very deadly card in multiplayer if you don't handle it quickly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126186-after-a-player-draws-any-number-of-cards-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=1320297","commentId":1320297,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1415009046,"content":"> Yes, it'll trigger separately for each player during the resource phase.  Very deadly card in multiplayer if you don't handle it quickly.\n\nDo you have a quotation for that?\n\n \n\nBecause I would think that since players draw simultaneously it will only trigger once in the resource phase; the danger being in players risking to draw cards individually during the staging step.\n\nEdited November 3, 2014 by Nerdmeister"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126186-after-a-player-draws-any-number-of-cards-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=1320554","commentId":1320554,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1415026889,"content":"All characters ready simultaneously during the refresh phase, but we once had official clarification that Silvan Tracker can heal each of them.  It doesn't matter that this happens simultaneously, they are still discrete events and count as separate triggers for a response."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126186-after-a-player-draws-any-number-of-cards-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=1320587","commentId":1320587,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1415028391,"content":"I´ll accept that reasoning as gospel.\n\n \n\nFeel a bit bummed I didn´t make that connection myself  :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126186-after-a-player-draws-any-number-of-cards-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=1320844","commentId":1320844,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1415038379,"content":"If you're interested, that ruling about Silvan Tracker is in the thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/page-2].\n \nYou can trigger the Silvan Tracker's ability for each Silvan character that readies during the refresh phase.
