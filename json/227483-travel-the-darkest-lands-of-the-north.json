Ressources will be generated by Stewart on Balin to give him enough ressources and Gondor trait, Card draw with King under the mountain and Erestor (ally). Questing will be boosted by Faramir and Sword that was broken if you have Aragorn. For defense Boromir and in this case Amarthuil Play the punching bag until I have enough allies out to chump block myself to victory (and hopefully end the quest before I run out of allies :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]), as Long as your threat is low enough (and in this quest it rarely is) Sam, who is usually a quest bot, if you use him instead of Aragorn, can defend a weak enemie, too (I run 2 copies of Hobbit cloak). Rest of the deck are a ton of Leadership and neutral Gondor allies, a very good tale and some other Events (pretty much can use anything here what goes great with mass allies adn even some copies of These high cost Events like doom hangs still as most of the time you will have tons of ressources after the initial rounds).\n\n \n\nNow that I read your comments I might have played it wrong, even though I don't use Balin that often he surely will have canceled a bad shadow effect during the night as I thought shadow effects and Encounter Card effects are two different Things :S\n\nJust googled it and I played it wrong -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png]\n\nGuess I have to get the quest out and replay it a bit..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227483-travel-the-darkest-lands-of-the-north/?do=findComment&comment=2363566","commentId":2363566,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1471102138,"content":"Hey, there are nightmare sidequests?
