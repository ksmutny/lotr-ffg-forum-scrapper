I was kind of sad with the breakdown of the Fellowship and the Elves' depart, but the fact that Tolkien could make me feel something made me realize what a great literary art that was.\nThe First Book had my first sight of Boromir, who went to Rivendell due to a prophetic dream and having his life ended before it's time; yet, he quickly became my favorite character until I met Éowyn.\n\n \n\nThe creation of the Fellowship was nice too, but I quickly get bored with much explanations. While I appreciated the second book, it was the less exciting of the three, in my opinion. It had nice skirmishes and stuff, but it was almost easy to predict what would happen next. The return of Gandalf and the Westfold remaining was the best part of the book; I was seriously feeling doomed until he returned."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74387-poll-which-have-you-read/?do=findComment&comment=724341","commentId":724341,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1353055445,"content":"Everything of course."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74387-poll-which-have-you-read/?do=findComment&comment=724348","commentId":724348,"userName":"Migwald","timestamp":1353056155,"content":"Read all of them except G.\n\nHard to pick a fave from the  LOTR three books, but if pushed would say Fellowship.\n\nFound Silmarillion a tough read but may have to give it another go.

Baddie who at least comes out to fight someone (even if only once). Battles are grander, not just orcs, orcs, a troll and more orcs, everything is turned to the 10th power, highs and lows. That silly ring in LotR? Trinket among others in terms of scale for Silmarillion's goodies. Rise and fall of greats (and the infamous) vs who, Saruman in LotR?\n\n \n\n \n\nthat is true- though it is the adventure like qualities of lotr that make me love it so much….epic is great, and silmarillion is great of course…it just covers too much ground too quickly for me\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAgreed to both.  The part of me that loves history (I was born about 100 years too late) just loves the Sil for what it is…  the larger story that defines every little detail in The Hobbit and LOTR cycle.\n\nI love them all, but realistically, The Hobbit is truly kid's material and just a snapshot in time of a singular (albeit influential) event.  The LOTR is obviously a bit larger in scale, but still a very specific story about a few important relationships more than anything else.  The Sil… well, the way I explain the comparisons between the LOTR and the Sil for those who have only read (or watched… sorry, Rich) the LOTR cycle is one very simple comparison (which usually goes something like this):\n\n\"You know that Balrog that was wicked awesome in Moria?  That seemed indestructable?  That took down Gandalf?  That was more ferocious than anything else in the books/movies save Sauron himself (and let's face it, Sauron didn't really DO anything other than stare really menacingly with a giant eyeball) or maybe the Witch King??  Yeah, well the bad guy in the Silmarillion (Melkor/Morgoth) has a whole bunch of those things he kept around him as his personal bodyguards…  and Sauron was just his right-hand guy.\"\n\n \n\nAlso, Sauron was a vampiric creature at one point who was bested by a girl and a dog.  This sounds much too similar to the characters in the Twilight series, so it's hard for me to think of Sauron as a real badass…. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI like how ppl often say they are sorry to Rich when refrencing the movies. It keeps things polite.\n\n I loved the Peter Jackson take on the Lord of the Rings (IN YOUR FACE MR.  SABRE!!…errr…I mean…sorry Rich…). Without PJ our Balrogs might not have wings! Wings are WWWAAAAAYYYY better. (I'm trolling?…………………………………….sorry Rich.)\n\n@ Ben, HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!
