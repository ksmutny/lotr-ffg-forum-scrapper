Pretty much the only ring that mattered without having to say its name. In this case, there are seven Palantiri, only seven, and as far as I know none is more important than the others to be called just \"The Palantir\" (even if one was, it would be the Orthanc one). \n\nAlso, what's that about \"only one of them is available to the free peoples\"? There were several Palantiri that were available to the free peoples in different places, and some of them were lost or their users corrupted, so it's not really \"The\" Palantir as you suggest. \n\nThe worst of all is that the card is not called \"The Palantir\" but rather just \"Palantir\" which feels rather generic and does not suggest a limited number of them, of which there was, and a very small one.\n\nI'm not trying to adapt logic to \"just language\". I'm trying to apply logic in a rather finite element-naming system. If it was just language and the way people \"name it within their world\", we could as well have \"Halfling\" or \"Little one\" instead of \"Merry\" and \"Pippin\", since Boromir and many other characters used to call them that in the novel.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78744-whos-going-to-be-the-ranger-hero-mentioned-at-the-end-of-the-new-assault-on-osgiliath-article/?do=findComment&comment=759384","commentId":759384,"userName":"jc1138","timestamp":1360145098,"content":"My first thought for the ranger was Halbarad, he is, after all, an \"Heir of Numenor\" in a sense.  I am hoping we will get a Faramir hero sometime during this cycle and feel it's almost a lock.  And if it is Faramir, I don't mind having to wait for 3-4 more adventure packs (cry me a river, whiners! jk)\n\nYeah, after seeing that palantir I'm hoping we'll get things like: Palantir of Osgiliath, …of Orthanc, Amon Sul, etc.  I know that in the book the only one's they really used were the Orthanc Stone and one at Minas Tirith, but the game is about possibilities (you can, after all, have a group of heroes with Thorin Oakenshield, Eowyn, and Glorfindel, which doesn't really make perfect sense, lorewise) so why not make a card for the Palantir of Annuminas?  One was kept there in Elendil's day.\n\nThat generic palantir is underwhelming to me, especially seeing as it can hit you for 6 threat.  Doesn't mean I won't try using it, and I've been way wrong about judging card's value before."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78744-whos-going-to-be-the-ranger-hero-mentioned-at-the-end-of-the-new-assault-on-osgiliath-article/?do=findComment&comment=759398","commentId":759398,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1360147450,"content":"I'd be much more worked up about the playability of the card rather than its specific name but since this is such a lore based game I suppose I see the point.\n\nAnother side note on the inevitable Faramir hero…PLEASE let his art be better than his previous iteration.  The leadership ally version didn't look awful; but with the talent of most of the artists illustrating this game, I think they can do far better.  I also agree that he'll be a lock for the spirit sphere with a low starting threat.

The fact that it shows you the next 3 cards coming from the encounter deck is pretty huge, if it didn't have such a high threat risk I think it would be an auto-include. We have a couple of dwarfs that can lower threat that would probably use this a lot. Combined with Denethor you can also get rid of the cards you know are worth getting rid of (Even get rid of a card and know what it's replacement is). So I think its amazing in a spirt/lore deck. (that knowledge also lets you maximise things like ranger spikes, know when to save for strider's paths and so on).\n\n \n\nOff Topic: I'd forgotton about the Palantir that looks to the west - but I don't functionally see how that could be a card. Functionally I think \"The Palantir\" would best reflect the relatitive importance of this Palantir compared to all the others, as far as the free people were concerned. I guess not having the word \"The\" to go with it is a little lazy, but not really a major issue to me. The fact that it's a unique artifiact more than accurately represents it's rairity."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78744-whos-going-to-be-the-ranger-hero-mentioned-at-the-end-of-the-new-assault-on-osgiliath-article/?do=findComment&comment=759610","commentId":759610,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1360182955,"content":"When I first saw the Palantir, I was underwhelmed, but I'm starting to warm up to it. I view the card draw as a bonus, with the real attraction being the ability to see what's coming up in the encounter deck (which makes thematic sense as well). The potential threat gain is substantial, but they had to build a meaningful drawback into this thing, otherwise it would be too powerful. I have a feeling that we might see a hero in the next few AP's that synergizes well with the Palantir as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78744-whos-going-to-be-the-ranger-hero-mentioned-at-the-end-of-the-new-assault-on-osgiliath-article/?do=findComment&comment=760010","commentId":760010,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1360241463,"content":"Gizlivadi said:\n\nWell, yeah, regarding its playability, it's pretty terrible… Exhausting Palantir and the Noble hero to draw up to 3 cards? and that's only if the three cards were the same type, which is highly unlikely in most scenarios, and if not, raise your threat by 2?

Most of the players cards from Third cycle is ok. Not weak not strong. Actually im happy with HON and Third cycle. Looks like in my opinion we reach a good level in the game.\n\nBut Palantir for now in my opinion is quite useless……. Will see as Beorn (from Hall of Beorn)  say : maybe with some new players cards Palantir will be more interesting.\n\nAlso i think we will get very powerful player cards in Hobbit second box!!! So will see!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78744-whos-going-to-be-the-ranger-hero-mentioned-at-the-end-of-the-new-assault-on-osgiliath-article/?do=findComment&comment=760135","commentId":760135,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1360259572,"content":"It's certainly an interesting card and I will give it a try once they publish this scenario in Germany. I guess Palantir makes the most sense when you choose \"enemies\" as type. That way you get two cards for each potential enemy, cards which might help you to deal with them. And if there are no enemies you have to raise your threat, ok, but you can safely send everyone questing during the next three turns. And Rumours from the Earth can help you to lower your threat a bit if you called the wrong type. With Shadow of the Past you can even place a correct card type at the top. For me Palantir is a serious alternative to Risk some Light."}]}
