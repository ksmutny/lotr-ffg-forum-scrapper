So even if he was exhaust during the action window of the Refresh phase you could still use its ability.\n\nThat said during the Refresh phase you first have to complete all the mandatory steps (readying cards, raising threat, passing along the first players token) and while you are doing those you cannot use Action abilities (but possibly some Responses). So Lore Aragorn's ability can always only be used after the mandatory Refresh phase threat raise, which means that if the end of the combat phase you are at 49 threat he cannot save you.\n\nEdited May 14, 2019 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295262-refresh-phase/?do=findComment&comment=3701511","commentId":3701511,"userName":"bitzurock","timestamp":1557835104,"content":"Ok..got it now...thank you!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295262-refresh-phase/?do=findComment&comment=3701571","commentId":3701571,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1557841096,"content":"The Refresh Phase includes these steps, in order:\n\n1. Ready cards\n\n2.
