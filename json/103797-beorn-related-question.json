Unfortunately, I think that Tactics and Spirit are the only two spheres with an effect like this for now. I can understand it is less appealing to add Landroval to your deck than Warden of Healing, who serves a more general purpose."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103797-beorn-related-question/?do=findComment&comment=1048416","commentId":1048416,"userName":"7theye","timestamp":1397443504,"content":"you can also use Dori to target damage on beorn and white tower watchmen. \n\n \n\nIf Beorn could be healed then he would pretty much be broken now wouldn't he :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
