In Gondor they were set on a sable coat of arms, together with the White Tree, which represented any of the descendants of Nimloth that grew in Minas Ithil and, later, Minas Tirith. The device of the Kings [http://www.forodrim.org/gobennas/heraldry/helendil.gif]To this device the Kings of the line of Elendil added the Silver Crown, which was the chief mark of royalty. In Arnor a single five-pointed star became used as a device, the Elendilmir, representing the Star of Earendil. In Gondor the device including the stars and the Silver Crown fell out of general use, until the time of Elessar and the Reunited Kingdom.\n\nTolkien Gateway [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Livery_of_Elendil] further notes, \"Upon Arnor's fall and the failing of the line of the Kings of Gondor the crown was largely dropped from usage and not until the coming of Aragorn, and the raising of his banner at the Battle of Pelennor Fields, was the crown used again.\"\n\nAnd from the actual books:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> There flowered a White Tree, and that was for Gondor; but Seven Stars were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count.\n> \n> The Return of the King, LoTR Book 5, Ch 6, \"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\"\n\nTo me, it looks as though there is space on that shield for seven stars, but the 3rd and 6th (counting clockwise from left) are missing for some reason. The shield is also positioned oddly relative to the soldier's body (too far to the side), assuming he's holding it with his forearm strapped horizontally parallel to the back of the shield.

Wouldn't understand if FFG releases a promo card with him on it in a pack he isn't in. It would also mean we get multiple Dwarf heroes this cycle, if Thorin isn't the one mentioned in the article."}]}
