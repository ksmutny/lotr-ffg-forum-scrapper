So elves thought orcs were made by Morgoth out of elves, but that does not mean they were right. Like in other similar chronicles when some fact is unknown because there are not witnesses the chronicler resort to legend to fill the emptiness. In this case elves tried to explain the origin of their enemies, an origin that had not verifiable explanation for them. They used the true fact that some of their kin were captured by Morgoth for sure, never to be seen, and linked this tragedy to the existence of the fallen creatures.\n\n \n\nTolkien discarded or tried to remake this previous idea about the elvish origin of the orcs though the legend remained as the official report after all. But orcs should be different beings with their own reproduction and of course, women. Indeed there are some scarce mentions to orc children in the books and notes by Tolkien.\n\nEdited August 11, 2015 by asfaloth"}]}
