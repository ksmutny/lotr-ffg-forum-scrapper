As soon as the players determine that the total committed Willpower is greater than the total Threat in the staging area, they are considered to have quested successfully. Any Forced or passive effects initiated by questing successfully resolve before physically placing progress tokens.\n \nso once you place the progress tokens on 4 you trigger that forced effect and you advance the quest to stage 2.  Even though you are still in the quest phase you have passed the window for any 'quested succefully' forced effects to happen.\n \nhere is a breakdown:\n1: compare threat and willpower\n2: more willpower, therefore successful quest\n3: Forced or passive effects initiated by questing successfully resolve\n4:  physically place progress token\n5:  Stage 4 forced effect triggers\n6:  advance to stage 2\n \nhope that helps,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123080-the-lonely-mountain-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1279525","commentId":1279525,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1411848547,"content":"Thanks for help chadgar ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"}]}
