Not that it wasn't obvious though. I still think their thinking process is interesting and accurate to what little we know. However, it's a shame that for all the lore behind this, we didn't get many cards reflecting the culture of the Dunlendings or the craft of ring-making. A \"Raven war-druid\" enemy or, as I've said twice already, a hillfort location or an Antlered Crown objective (or even player attachment- one can only dream!) would have been really great, as well as a Saruman's Ring attachment.\n\nEdited December 24, 2014 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129759-smoke-and-blood-and-fire/?do=findComment&comment=1379656","commentId":1379656,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1419390447,"content":"Art for the encounter cards as always is goddamn epic! I really like the theme, locations and quest stages even though I really dislike Dunlending enemies. As for easiest last stage of a cycle I don't know if I agree as it looks a bit harder than Return to Mirkwood (which so long as you have plenty of threat reduction and can take on a troll or attercop isn't really that hard) and Escape from Moria can also be very easy if you get the right quest stage early on. I doubt it will be harder than Morgul Vale however which I find one of the hardest quests in the gain both due to extreme threat gain and very tough enemies/bosses.\n\n \n\nAsfaloth, Northern Tracker and other location control cards are going to be very important in this quest I think, getting rid of locations as often as possible before the time effect triggers seems crucial.  Stage 2 actually hinders clearing locations whilst they are in staging giving them an additional 2 quest points which I think is really neat. Stage 3 is very cool and reminiscent of both Dunland Trap and Nin-in-Eilph, no progress has to be placed (except for clearing the war chiefs camp) but you just need to hold off enemies and beat the boss. Chief Turch as a three attack ally for the whole game is pretty epic and you can even use him to defend a few lesser attacks throughout as well, the fact he doesn't exhaust is great and means you both defend and attack in the same turn with him. Raven Warrior seems especially nasty as if you have 4 or more cards in your hand as it will remove most time counters in play and help many nasty time triggers effect you earlier. At least he has an engagement cost of 36 so early game you can snipe him with buffed Haldir/sneak attack Gandalf and Galadhon Archer. The Skirmisher doesn't seem so bad at all but has a very low engagement. \n\n \n\nOverall it looks fairly difficult and really really fun. You have to clear locations before they raise your threat, spread damage, bring more enemies out etc etc whilst battling a dunlending horde and you must also kill the Raven Chief at the end after exploring his camp. Using Chief Turch (as one of the attackers) to land the last blow on the Raven Chief and kill him will be very satisfying! Pretty excited for this last pack!\n\nAlso just noticed that each location other than the Raven Chief's Camp does NOT replace the time counters after they run out.... thats fairly interesting and will make the quest a little less punishing considering locations time effects cannot trigger more than once. THEN I reread the treachery card Raising the Cry which can put time counters back on locations. \n\nReally really like what they have done here mechanically. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129759-smoke-and-blood-and-fire/?do=findComment&comment=1379658","commentId":1379658,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1419390480,"content":">  \n> \n> > Imgur is very easy to use, I suggest that\n> \n> timely-aid-trg.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/timely-aid-trg.jpg]\n> \n>  \n\n?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129759-smoke-and-blood-and-fire/?do=findComment&comment=1379665","commentId":1379665,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1419390768,"content":"He means that you were late to suggest TinyPic since he already uploaded the images."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129759-smoke-and-blood-and-fire/?do=findComment&comment=1379775","commentId":1379775,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1419398711,"content":"ah ok fair enough, yeah I had it typed up hours before I posted it and didn't see the updates and cards already spoiled =P\nFunny though they were in the end spoiled through imgur anyway "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129759-smoke-and-blood-and-fire/?do=findComment&comment=1380712","commentId":1380712,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1419469294,"content":"Does this pack have the most unimaginative name on a last stage ever?
