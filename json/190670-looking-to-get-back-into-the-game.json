If you want another ‘easier’ quest, you could buy The Hills of Amon Muil.\n\n \n\nAlso, check your manual for the so-called 'easy mode'. If your manual doesn't include it, look for the latest manual online. Easy mode tells you to remove some of the nastier cards in the encounterdeck and let's you start with 1 additional resource on each hero. It's a much more relaxed way to play.\n\n \n\nOther than that, the best way to make the game easier without getting  too ‘serious’ with deckbuilding guides etc. is to buy a few more packs to increase your player cardpool so you can build more powerful decks.\n\n \n\nThe Watcher in the Water, Foundation of Stone and Shadow and Flame are imo. the best packs to get some of the most powerful player cards in the game. With these cards, you should be able to build a pair of decks that can handle the game’s easier quest no problemo. Then you can work your way into more difficult quests from there. Remember that you’ll need the Khazad Dum expansion in order to play the quests from the above mentioned adventure packs. Those quests are significantly more difficult though. So you could buy the 3 AP's first, then if you still like the game, buy Khazad Dum so you can play the quests from those packs as well!\n\n \n\nAlternatively, the AP The Stewards Fear has a set of player cards called ‘Outlands’ which are one of the most powerful deck types in the game. Give those cards to one player and you’ll be in great shape as wel! That’s the cheapest way (in terms of money of course!) to get an edge over the encounter deck. The quest included in that box (as well as that entire cycle) is waaaaay too difficult if you don’t own all the cards leading up tot hem, so don’t bother yet.\n\n \n\nMy advice would be to buy:\n\n-        Watcher in the Water\n\n-        Foundation of Stone\n\n-        Shadow and Flame\n\n(then buy Khazad Dum if you get bored of the quests from the core set to unlock the quests)\n\nOr\n\n-        The Stewards Fear\n\n \n\nBuild some decks with those player cards and you’ll have a much more relaxed time. If you’ll get bored with the easier quests, you can try the ones from those AP’s you bought or buy some more from the Shadow of Mirkwood cycle (which came out before Khazad Dum, so they are generally easier). As you’ll get more experienced, you’ll do fine.\n\n \n\nIf the addition of more player cards still isn’t doing much for you, you’ll either need to invest more time (watch playthroughs online, read deck building guides etc.) or money (buy more packs for more player cards). But in that case, the game might be asking too much of your attention to enjoy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190670-looking-to-get-back-into-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1838652","commentId":1838652,"userName":"GalaxyUC","timestamp":1444237990,"content":"Easy Mode is the way to do.
