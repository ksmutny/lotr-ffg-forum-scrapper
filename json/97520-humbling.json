Then I went online to read about deck building and discovered many, many tips that made the game a lot more playable. I would highly recommend that you check out the progression series on youtube as well as the websites: Master of Lore, Hall of Beorn, and Tales from the Cards. Each of these sites has plenty of deckbuilding advice plus tips on how to play the game.\n\n \n\nThe reality of your situation is that until you get a bigger card pool, the game is going to be very difficult and success will be elusive at best. BUT.... that's part of the fun. The wins will come and when they do, they will feel very epic.\n\n \n\nOne of the interesting things about this game is that every time you buy new player cards, you also get a new scenario which is really fun because each scenario is slightly different and lets you see the game in a new light and gives you new deck building ideas. As to which expansions to buy first, I would recommend you check out the New Players Guides [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/new-player-guides/] on Tales from the Cards, in particular the new player buying guide [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/]. There's no need to rush out and buy everything. If you know what style of play you want, you can get the card packs that suit you best.\n\n \n\nGood luck with the game, and take heart, the learning curve is tough but the game is worth it. The more I play, the better it gets and I feel the game as a whole has finally hit its stride and the best is yet to come."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97520-humbling/?do=findComment&comment=960829","commentId":960829,"userName":"Scroll Lock","timestamp":1390340502,"content":"You are NOT an idiot!

So they have to make the quest accessible to people with the entire mirkwood set and as much as people talk **** about it, FFG expects you to buy 1 extra set of core at least. The card distribution is designed to encourage that.\n\n \n\nOther than that, with out knowing your exact card pool it is hard to help... but in my experience I find dunhere + eowyn and Beravore to be a strong contender for this scenario when you just have the core cards. Once you get a few packs this quest beings a 100% win scenario.\n\n \n\nIf you post your exact card pool we can offer more specific advice."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97520-humbling/?do=findComment&comment=961047","commentId":961047,"userName":"Road Runner","timestamp":1390355858,"content":"Thanks for the replies, this seems like a pretty cool forum.  In following up some of the resources provided, I'm getting the impression that using just the basic core one sphere one Gandalf deck just isn't up to snuff.  Guess its time to learn deck building!\n\n \n\nThanks again, gotta make my way down the Anduin.......\n\n \n\nMilton"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97520-humbling/?do=findComment&comment=961091","commentId":961091,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1390361518,"content":"yeah this is a constructed game.. no doubt.
