Stalling to drop threat in fact worsens your score.\n\nI think threat gose to zero, I do not think it can go minus. Though during teh caculation of teh final score I think it can. Like your personal threat can nto go -5 ... but when you do your score you can go -5, then you add the turn count x 10 and you will always be  back in teh positive.\n\nBe interesting to see what deck you used. I'm trying to make a restricted deck for this quest and finding it pretty hard to get one running.. that wins a lot."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59374-i-just-murdered-rosgobel-few-questions-on-epic-victory/?do=findComment&comment=583265","commentId":583265,"userName":"Captain Poe","timestamp":1327255212,"content":"Unfortunately i couldn't really tell you turn by turn. I'll tell you the cards i used and how each came in use as I can recall:\n\nIn my experience, this quest is brutal for a few reasons:\n\nDirect damage -  I delt with this through healing cards and spirit counter cards\n\nFlying enemies - threw in a few ranged allies, that seemed to do the trick.\n\nOutside of that, the only real trouble is questing... which with this build, i didn't really have a problem. as a matter of fact, twards the end i was having eowyn sit out of the questing phase because i didn't want to complete the quest before lowering my threat all the way:\n\nTheodred - Quester, use to generate needed resources, depending on card draw and sphere requirements.\n\nBeravor - use mainly for card draw\n\nEowyn - use for questing.\n\nNeutral -\n\n2x Gandalf - Used with sneak attack twice, then played twice. Each time i used him to lower threat by 5\n\n2x Song of wisdom - Used one on Eowyn\n\n2x Song of Kings - Used on on Eowyn\n\nSpirit -\n\n3x - Ancient Mathom - Pulled two, and put both of them on rosgobel. When i explored it, it was like christmas :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n2x Galadhrim's Greeting - Used both, and eventually redrew one of them for a second time.\n\nDwarven Tomb - Used with Galadhrims Greeting.\n\n2x Escort From Edoras - Didn't come into play\n\n2 Westfold Horse-Breaker - Had one in play. never used him, but could have been used with beravor if needed\n\n2x Hasty Stroke - Used to prevent extra damange from shadow cards\n\n2x test of will - One of the most valuable cards in this quest. Almost used Dwarven tomb on this, but took my chances.\n\nUnexpected Courage - Used on Beravor for extra card generation, or to use her as attack/block/object gather if needed\n\nLeadership:\n\n2x Sneak attack - Used to lower threat with gandalf. Could have been used to instead kill enemies with gandalf if needed.\n\n2x steward of gondor - put both of these on eowyn. With her 2 songs, she was a money making machine.\n\n3x Snowborn scout - Used to take out locations quicker, to keep threat in check.\n\n2x Farimar - never came into play.\n\n2x Silverlode archer - used to attack flying enemies, only one came into play.\n\nParting gift - never came into play, but useful if you dont have songs in play or a steward.\n\nLore\n\n3x Lore of imladris - Used 2 on wyliador, one on Theordred (I let an orc attack go unblocked because i had a hasty stroke in hand).\n\n3x Self Preservation - Put one on Beravor and used her to block a few times after my deck ran out and I no longer needed her to generate draw\n\n2x Radagast's cunning - Never needed to use\n\n2x Secret Paths - never needed to use.\n\n2x Minor from Iron hills - Never used. When I won, theodred was caught in a web, but by that point, i wasn't even worried.\n\n3x haldir - had him in play. Useful for killing flying enemies.\n\nBeorn's Hospitality - Never needed to use it.\n\nLoriens wealth - used for 3 extra cards earlier in game.\n\n \n\nThats it! I thought i would need more questing power... as i figured i would heal Wyliador for all damange, and then rush to the finishline before he could take more damage, but it actually was never really needed. I had more than enough questers, and the 2 ranged allies i had in play were more than enough to handle the 4 flying monster I delt with. I lucked out, and most of my draw was treachery, which i countered or took and was able to then heal, or locations, which i quickly got out of the staging area and explored. I only use cards up to the current expansion so far, so this deck could be greatly improved. I may suggest dropping Eowyn for Elanor... but Eowyn is VERY useful early game. I would say dump the Rad's Cunning and Secret path cards, as they aren't really needed (though, they may help if you do use elanor instead).\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59374-i-just-murdered-rosgobel-few-questions-on-epic-victory/?do=findComment&comment=583267","commentId":583267,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1327255506,"content":"So...
