I know that less cards = more consistency, but I also know that sometimes people get bored with decks that are too consistent. I've seen people mention they only put in two copies of some cards to combat that, but....some math.\n\n \n\n3 copies in a 50 card deck: 6% chance to pull\n\n2 copies in a 50 card deck: 4% chance to pull\n\n \n\n3 copies in a 60 card deck: 5% chance to pull.\n\n \n\nIt seems like a good half way point....as long as there's not that one card you REALLY need that extra % to get a hold of.\n\n \n\nI've played with less cards than 50 when I started off with the core only. I've played with 54 at my largest (with a very limited card pool).\n\n \n\nA quick search of the forums last week never really saw this talked about, but I could've missed it.

Maybe someone's made an insane amount of card draw that they wanted more than 50 cards before?\n\nThat's a whole different argument.  I rarely run 3 copies of any unique except for Light of Valinor with Glorfindel.  I also only allow myself to use Steward of Gondor if I'm using Gondor heroes or playing Nightmare quests.  I try to avoid some of the other staples like Sneak Attack + Gandalf or Unexpected Courage unless they are crucial to the deck idea.  But then there are some cards like Test of Will and Feint that you need to run 3 copies in every deck.  I just can't quit you, Test of Will."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175662-greater-than-50-card-decks/?do=findComment&comment=1612255","commentId":1612255,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1431103866,"content":"I don't put three copies of the Steward of Gondor, not only because it would be boring but also because when I play a deck without (extensive) card draw, each card needs to count, so the extra uniques can be very annoying when you draw them instead of a card that can actually do something for you. Of course in the long run, it may not be the most powerful strategy but the purpose of games is also (or primarily) the enjoyment.\n\nI do use extra copies of unique cards like O Lórien! in decks that can discard them -- with Daeron's Runes, for instance.\n\nEdited May 8, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175662-greater-than-50-card-decks/?do=findComment&comment=1612293","commentId":1612293,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1431105331,"content":"Less card in deck more effective play.
