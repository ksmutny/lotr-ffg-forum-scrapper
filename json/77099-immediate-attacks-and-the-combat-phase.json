Does this enemy attack a third time when it is the next players turn?\n\nSince you are supposed to resolve shadow cards first, I think the enemy would engage the other player before resolving its immediate attack. If the player with which the enemy had been instructed to re-engage and resolve an immediate attack had not already gone through its defend against enemy attacks step during the combat phase, then the enemy would end up doing an immediate attack against the newly engaged player, and then a second attack against that player once it was his turn to defend during the combat phase.\n\nIf there had also been an immediate attack against the originally engaged player during the quest phase (due to a treachery card or whatever), then there would have been one attack vs. the originally engaged player, then two against the newly engaged player (assuming that newly engaged player is not the \"first player\").\n\nThere can be all sorts of variations on the above scenario, depending on the exact nature of the cards involved.\n\nCould you maybe give a bit more info about exactly what happened (i.e., which cards were revealed, who was first player, how far you were in the round/combat sequence, etc.)? Might be easier to give you an accurate answer then.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77099-immediate-attacks-and-the-combat-phase/?do=findComment&comment=2904824","commentId":2904824,"userName":"jnicol","timestamp":1501366173,"content":"> 57 minutes ago, TwiceBornh said:\n> \n> Since you are supposed to resolve shadow cards first, I think the enemy would engage the other player before resolving its immediate attack.

Does this enemy attack a third time when it is the next players turn?\n\nIn this case, the enemy would attack a total of two times - once from the normal attack against the player which resulted in the \"Engage the next player and make an immediate attack\" shadow card, and once from that shadow effect. An enemy does not make additional attacks as a result of becoming engaged with a different player unless specifically directed to by a card effect.
