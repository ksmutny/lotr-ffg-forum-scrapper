At the bottom he says that The Hunt for Gollum and Redhorn Gate are the best Nightmare quests to get if you want an experience that kind of \"fixes\" the older version of the quest without making it too hard. I was wondering if this is still the case after the Ring-maker cycle or are some of the newer ones better?\n\nI guess what I'm wanting is the \"easiest\" Nightmare deck that makes an older quest even better. For instance, my playgroup was almost ready to run out of the room after we played Druadan Forest which is one of the decks he says is definitely better than the original. Which other later ones would fit this description?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdited February 5 by rhtm70"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305457-nightmare-decks/?do=findComment&comment=3888948","commentId":3888948,"userName":"rhtm70","timestamp":1581117140,"content":"I didn't see the question in strategy about Nightmare decks and the excellent blog from Darkling Door so that kind of makes my question obsolete.

I don't know what are the easiest nightmare,. But they goes up to the dream-chaser cycle actually.

My vote would probably be here for what to check out.\n\nThe only other thing I've played on nightmare is the Hobbit Saga solo.. Yeah I'd avoid that one unless you want a nice long puzzle.Â "}]}
