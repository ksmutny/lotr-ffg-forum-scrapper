I'm switching to Tactics and running another 5 games, then doing the same with each starter to get an idea before I delve into deck-building.\n\nMy sister and I ran Spirit and Tactics versus Passage Through Mirkwood, and had some challenges but we were able to get to Beorn's Path and get two counters on it before I got 50 Threat and her Spirit deck got curb stomped.\n\nI like how the cards interact, and how multi-sphere is currently the way to go.

One thing I've learned though, is that this game is really meant to be played with a combination of spheres, at least, in the early going. Leadership is a pretty good all around deck, but tactics and spirit have major opposite weaknesses, which ironically enough, means that they probably complement each other well. Lore I haven't tried yet.

More important than the deck was the incredible streak of luck at the beginning of the scenario: I revealed four treason cards that had no (or almost no) effect while threat was below 35. That allowed me to build up a sufficiently large army of allies without any disturbances. My starting hand also included a Forest Trap and Gandalf, so dealing with the hill troll was also easy.\n\nThat doesn't change my opinion, though. I don't think there's a way to win it consistently by building a strong deck, it will always require luck - and no small amount of it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45734-to-easy-to-hard-winloss-ratios/?do=findComment&comment=460198","commentId":460198,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1303940670,"content":"jhaelen said:\n\nI don't think there's a way to win it consistently by building a strong deck, it will always require luck - and no small amount of it.\n\n\n\nI totally second that.
