Not sure if they're wide enough for sleeved cards (but I don't use sleeves anyway). \n * There's about 20mm of space in the lid for the rule books etc.\n * It's made from 7mm ply & 3mm MDF with brass hardware.\n * The divider slots were cut using a jig on a table saw.  It makes a laborious task reasonably quick & easy.\n\nNext up is to cut some of the actual dividers, then onto building a 2nd one for the AH LCG.  Hopefully I can learn from my mistakes & improve on this one.\n\nCheers,\n\nJim.\n\n \n\nIMG_1169.JPG [http://www.dmgaming.com.au/Gallery/LotRLCG/IMG_1169.JPG]\n\n \n\nIMG_1207.JPG [http://www.dmgaming.com.au/Gallery/LotRLCG/IMG_1207.JPG]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/258866-home-made-lotr-case/?do=findComment&comment=2987340","commentId":2987340,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1505706505,"content":"Lovely job!

With the laminated dividers, it’s awfully tight. So I need to move the MDF dividers into the middle of the box by a few mm and give them some more space.\n\n-The cards are rubbing on the front & back of the box. Some additional felt should take care of that.\n\n-The cards are catching on the divider slots. My initial thought was to just scrap the slots, then I remembered I have a sheet of 1mm styrene left over from the old 40k days. So I should be able to cut strips of that to act as a spacer to keep the cards off the divider slots.\n\nLast night I ripped out the dividers. Proving that the glue is stronger than the MDF. A little bit of sanding & paint should fix that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/258866-home-made-lotr-case/?do=findComment&comment=2999661","commentId":2999661,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1506486887,"content":"It looks amazing.
