The main strength of the deck comes off the encounter deck manipulation.\nDenethor has grown tired of Elrond and other Elven Lords always having their merry social gatherings and never inviting him; and he decided to have a council of his own. At the time he wasn’t particularly keen on large cooperation, since others would usually only thwart his schemes. Thus he had to work in secrecy. He also wanted to keep things out of the family for a change but he took advantage of his son Boromir having had previously made friends with Glorfindel. The Elf has been highly renowned and Denethor was in desperate want for such alliances. To make the party all the more cheerful, the Steward of Gondor invited a Silvan lass Mirlonde, renowned more for her looks rather than her skills. Though Denethor wanted to make things private, he couldn’t prevent Gandalf from sneaking in for some free drinks, which is why he usually showed up in the White City despite his pretences of giving (ill-news) advice and shedding (weird) light on foreign affairs. The number of guests (to Denethor’s fright) has grown over night as many were trying to take advantage of Gondor’s hospitality. Most of the usual suspects were present: the notorious Henamarth Riversong, the ever dreamy Gléowine, a couple of Mirkwood Runners, very thirsty from all that running with messages, they couldn’t wait to part with Thranduil’s authoritative rule; and even two Silvan Refugees were let in for a bowl of hot soup. In the end, the skinny Elves together with Ithilien Trackers (having had long suffered from Faramir’s cruel herbal diet) have pillaged many a pantry before the night grew old. Arwen was sent as her father’s spy but her presence was a bit undermined. And Glorfindel brought with him his two pals in mischief, the infamous feast crashers Haldir and Gildor. And when even the Elven smiths got dizzy from all the Southern wine (quite unlike the clear liquid they were used to been served in Imladris after closing hours), Wardens of Healing had to be called for, long before a battle was begun."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85176-deck-building-middle-earth-a-new-lotr-lcg-website/?do=findComment&comment=806070","commentId":806070,"userName":"GhostWolf69","timestamp":1372134687,"content":"Love the site Rich really cool!\n\nI like th eCategories you have listed and like the idea behind each deack so far.\n\nSuggestion (you probably allready thought about it but just in case):\n\nWouldn't it be cool to use those categories to \"rate\" each Scenario?\n\nHow important is this and that category in this or that scenario, like.\n\nThat would be an awesome strategy help for deck-builders.\n\nThanks and Great work!\n\n/wolf"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85176-deck-building-middle-earth-a-new-lotr-lcg-website/?do=findComment&comment=806078","commentId":806078,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1372140086,"content":"Thanks ghostwolf- that is a great idea! i shall pass along your compliments and idea to the author, and we shall see about getting up a scenario table with ratings\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85176-deck-building-middle-earth-a-new-lotr-lcg-website/?do=findComment&comment=806092","commentId":806092,"userName":"GhostWolf69","timestamp":1372145911,"content":"My pleasure.

So far there is Journey Down The Anduin and Escape From Dol Guldur [http://lordoftheringslcg.weebly.com/the-warm-up.html]\n\n\"This is to provide players with basic strategy against some selected quests. The overall idea is not to build decks to defeat specific quests, but to have several decks ready and choose the appropriate when facing a scenario. Below are the quests in question and some ideas that should help one succeed. The detailed description of the quest will often try to touch upon all the strategic categories of deck-building.\n\nThe Warm-up\nThe Warm-up for the readers here consists of Journey Down the Anduin (solo) and Escape from Dol Guldur (coop). Dol Guldur solo is a strange quest design as it has a maximum of two heroes facing a minimum of four encounter cards on the first round of the game. It can be won but in the majority of the trials, a re-shuffle will be needed after a round or two (caused by the premature end of the game). Anduin coop, on the other hand, can become quite easy even for skilled begginers, using only the core set material.\"\n\nRich"}]}
