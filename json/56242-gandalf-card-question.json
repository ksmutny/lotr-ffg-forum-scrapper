I myself have read and re-read the rules and official FAQ quite a few times and I still miss things. For example, until recently I missed the part on page 8 of the rules where it says that a resource icon indicates to which sphere the hero card itself belongs and was play songs as though they only provided a resource token which meant that sphere specific cards such as A Burning Brand couldn't be attached to a hero like Aragorn (Leadership) even if he had the song of wisdom attached - this is clearly wrong as was pointed out to me when I asked about it on this forum. \n\nOne thing to consider is that people learn in different ways, some people absorb information more efficiently by asking questions than reading rules. Some people may simply need the information presented in a slightly different way. In my opnion, it doesn't do anything to create a sense of community to respond by saying \"yes, read the rules please\" If you can't be bothered taking the time to explain properly, then leave it to someone else.\n\nI agree that we should encourage people to read the rules, however as I said in my previous post, it would be courteous to provide a page number at the very least. I also agree that we need to treat each other with respect (even if we have taken offence).\n\nIt is one thing to tell people to check the forum to see if anything has previously been posted but this forum in my opinion doesn't have a particularly user friendly search function and it can take quite some time to find what you are looking for. It can be much quicker to simply create a new topic and ask your question.\n\n@ the OP, please don't be put off by the unhelpfulness of the two \"punks\" as you called them. There are many of us who are more than happy to answer any questions you might have. The only stupid question is the one you dont ask. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56242-gandalf-card-question/?do=findComment&comment=555983","commentId":555983,"userName":"Runner5","timestamp":1321302533,"content":"Marlow said:\n\nWe don't need this forum to become just another forum where new players are hesitant to interact.
