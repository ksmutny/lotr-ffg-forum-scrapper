It writes about how little the critics actually know of Tolkien, and sometimes of films, also.\n\nFor my perspective, when I saw the LotR trilogy, I loved it as a film, especially the Fellowship was a real treat and a great emotional journey. But for me the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is way superior as an adaptation. It really stays much closer to the original material (especially as intended by Tolkien in his latter days when he went to write the Quest for Erebor). And it does not have any of the previous misahap of the likes of the Army of the Dead or Denethor being simply mad. Even as a film, it has a better acting with Freeman being a much more enjoyable Hobbit than any of the former movies (perhaps safe Ian Holm himself) and Richard Armitage seems a perfect Thorin as his character becomes a beautiful mix of Aragorn and Boromir - in its tragic majesty. As a Tolkien nerd of sorts, I could not recommend the movie more."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76650-a-good-article-about-the-hobbit-film/?do=findComment&comment=742230","commentId":742230,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1357215970,"content":"A very interesting article, I'm glad you posted it, as it one that could spark a lot of conversations and debate. Let me preface this by saying that overall I enjoyed The Hobbit and have been itching to watch it again. However, there were a few things that rankled me. My partner saw it with me. She loved The Lord of the Rings movies despite her not being a Tolkien reader or much of a fantasy fan, and overall liked The Hobbit as well, but saw it as not being of the same quality as the LOTR trilogy. Interestingly, she said what bothered her were all these different pieces included that felt like allusions to material that she hadn't read but yet weren't explained very well for the non-Tolkien fan. I, on the other hand, being very familiar with the source material, liked some of these inclusions but was bothered by some of the substantial changes to the story as told in the book. So I think the article's idea that those who are critical of the movie do so from a place of not understanding Tolkien is a bit simplistic. \n\nSome of my big beefs are (I have smaller beefs like Radagast's depiction, Azog's inclusion, etc.):\n\n* Thorin in the book is a bit of a jerk really. Greedy, at times mean-spirited, and not really the heroic or altruistic kind. By contrast, Thorin in the movie seems to be the very definition of a hero, albeit with some heavily emphasized character flaws (hates elves, distrusts Bilbo, etc.). In the book, his primary motive is to regain treasure. In the movie, his quest is a more noble one to regain his homeland. I understand why the change was made for the film. I just wonder if it takes away from some of what Tolkien intended for the character.\n\n* The Dwarves become mighty warriors in the film. In the book, they aren't really. If you think about it, they make it through their journey largely either because of Gandalf or Bilbo. Trolls - Gandalf, Goblin caves - Gandalf, Spiders - Bilbo, Imprisonment - Bilbo, Smaug - Bard, Battle of Five Armies - Gandalf/Beorn/Eagles. Granted, they do take up arms at the end of the book in the big battles, but we see very little of them actually fighting in that instance. In the movie, despite them saying that they are not great warriors at the beginning, they sure seem that way when decimating hundreds of goblins in that escape scene. Again, I understand why the change was made. Perhaps it makes for better cinema. But I think Tolkien specifically intended for them not to be warriors. In fact, they are a little bit hapless in general (they never stopped to think about how they were going to actually steal the treasure or get rid of Smaug until they got there!). Does it take away from Tolkien's message/theme/story a bit to make them fearsome and semi-invincible warriors?\n\nAnyway, I guess my bigger point is that Tolkien fans may be critical of the movie for changing the source material, rather than staying too close to it (as the article argues). And usually I hate to give film critics any support, but I think they are justified in judging the movie on its own merits as a film and experience rather than having to know the ins and outs of Tolkien. Again, as I said, I overall have a positive feeling towards the film but can also harbor some substantial criticisms as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76650-a-good-article-about-the-hobbit-film/?do=findComment&comment=742253","commentId":742253,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1357219511,"content":"I saw it with my partner also. She is not a geek, only know of Tolkien through myself. She liked the LotR movies but found them rather long, The Hobbit on the other hand, when it was over, she wondered if it really were nigh three hours. From my perspective also, I find the criticism of pacing the most absurd of all, the movie flew by very quickly in my opinion, certainly much quicker than many movies such critics usually praise.\n\nI totally agree about Thorin. Except at times, and especially at the very end, Thorin of the book is not nearly as interesting as the portrayal in the movie. I really think, as the article mentions, this is close to the version Tolkien would have written, had he written it after the LotR.\n\nAs for the extra stuff, it is really mostly all there in the apendices, some of it is altered, like Azog instead of Bolg but I think each directer deserves some liberty and if one thinks about it, and compares it to usual alternations or changes in other adaptations, this is really the smallest imaginable change.\n\nThe one disadvantage the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has compared to the likes of the Fellowship of the Ring, it does not feel as a finished movie. The LotR films were really good at having a great climax, despite being the end of the story. I do not mind this one bit but I see that some people have problems with that; they should understand, however, that this is only part of the story. I think it will be wonderful to see all three movies at once - if one finds time for that. And as for the epic emotional scenes that were present in the LotR movies and were sort of missing in the first part of the Hobbit; well, they sure are coming in the latter volumes, and I can hardly wait to see them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76650-a-good-article-about-the-hobbit-film/?do=findComment&comment=742265","commentId":742265,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1357221872,"content":"Azog should never be at the movie.

I certainly do not find it a problem but I at least see where the people are coming from, unlike when they criticise the pacing or when they say the singing at Bag End took forever (actually one of the so-called top critics said that) and it took around 3 minutes in total (for two songs). You can see these people often just try to show off - somehow, yet it escapes me how readers can take them seriously.\n\nThe only one thing in which I find the LotR movies superior (though only slightly) is the emotional impact. But as I said, I believe the latter installments will bring just that. [spoiler ahead] I think Thorin's parting with Bilbo will be very moving (as it is indeed in the book)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76650-a-good-article-about-the-hobbit-film/?do=findComment&comment=742309","commentId":742309,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1357227708,"content":"Well, I guess it all comes down to how much we expect Jackson to stay faithful to the actual text of The Hobbit. In general, there are always changes made in adaptations, to a greater or lesser degree depending on the director and scriptwriters. What's subjective is how much each of us values faithfulness to the text. For the most part, I can forgive Jackson's liberties in LOTR and The Hobbit and come away with an overall positive experience, despite some of them sitting uneasily with me (and this is as true of the LOTR movies as it is of The Hobbit). Talking about just The Hobbit, we want to see the movie reflect the book because it is dear to us and we want to see what we read up on the screen, and maybe also because we worry about Tolkien's intentions or vision for characters and themes being changed (with him not being alive to have a say about it). That's why I brought up the changes to Thorin, and the dwarves being depicted as fearsome warriors. Tolkien may have rewrote Thorin as more heroic, then again he may not have and maybe Thorin being a bit unlikable was part of what made his realization at the end of the book more poignant.  \n\nOn the other hand, there are considerations that come into making good movies that conflict with how you write books. For instance, I will probably be flayed alive for saying this, and The Hobbit has a very special place in my heart reading it many times as a kid, but in some parts it is not very well-written. Reading it more recently, it is astonishing at how fast the narrative moves (I understand it is in many ways a kid's book, but still). The big baddie, Smaug, who is built up as a nigh-invincible foe, has a couple of very brief scenes in the book and then is quickly dispatched with one arrow. I wouldn't be suprised, in fact I very much hope, Jackson does make changes in that case because that would make some very anti-climactic cinema. Then again, you could say that it is a bit more realistic or thematic that Smaug is not killed by these hapless dwarfs and a small Hobbit but by his own pride/vanity and a more heroic (lucky?) character - Bard. Where is the line between making changes that make the story play better on film and fundamentally altering the spirit of the story? That is a very hard line to walk."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76650-a-good-article-about-the-hobbit-film/?do=findComment&comment=742345","commentId":742345,"userName":"Alex6222","timestamp":1357233811,"content":"I'm with you Raven about Smaug.

What I wanted to mean (maybe poorly expressed) is that they all do not fight until day light comes up. In the book, they all were sacked and save by Gandalf playing with the trolls voices.

Whole flashback to the Battle of Azalnubizar rubbed me wrong, Thorin getting his nickname part probably the one thing I could agree with. Where was Dain, why was Thror (or was it Thrain that was killed in the movie) there? Nothing about Dain (or anyone) going up to the door to Moria and seeing the shadow within.\n\nGlamdring and Orcrist not glowing, annoying, but okay. But Bilbo charging Azog and his Warg and doing a better job than any of the dwarves, come on! Even with my hobbit-hate, that's too much. Of course, the whole scene would've been left out except Azog had to be included. \n\nBoth times the Elves showed up pissed me. Whole coming to check the burning of Dale and Erebor and leaving, why are you even there? So ****ing unnecessary! But even worse somehow was the fight before Rivendell. Seriously, Elves are allowing Orcs to escape? What is this crap!? You know there were within feet of finding the secret entrance?
