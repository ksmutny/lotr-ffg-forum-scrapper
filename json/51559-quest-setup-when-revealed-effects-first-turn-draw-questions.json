Even if they don't do anything at that point. Think of it as a good start compared to a 3 enemy bad start.

In case of Dol Goldur set up it actually says \"attach\" so I do not apply the \"when revealed\" effects there. Yet some people think they should according to the Guarded keyword but I understand that note is for objectives revealed from the encounter deck - as the rules read. I find this one of the clearer FAQ points, yet some people strongly disagree."}]}
