If you have three Spirit heroes and no boost to your resources this means 4 turns to play all three of them and nothing else. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54580-can-you-have-more-than-1-northern-tracker-in-play/?do=findComment&comment=540612","commentId":540612,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1318363962,"content":" Exactly Puzzle...I don't usually play this guy (though I admit, he is very good at handling locations in the staging area)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54580-can-you-have-more-than-1-northern-tracker-in-play/?do=findComment&comment=540623","commentId":540623,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1318365750,"content":" Just as an anecdote, today I was Playing the Hills of Emyn Muil for the first time today and I was excited to get a Northern Tracker in my opening hand, since I knew this was a very location-heavy quest.\n\nHis ability only got used once, and that was then undone by a treachery card. I got both of my Northern Trackers out, but I was managing my Quest phase so efficiently that they ended up just hanging back and helping kill the occasional monster.\n\n(This was a solo game with a pure Spirit deck and it owned the quest.)"}]}
