So it is a good base for building competative decks, But core + only one of those Hobbit scenarios is definitely too hard! With both it is manageable.

Marketing way an logic way you buy them in the order they come out. Core set, Mirkwood cycle, Kahzad-Dum, second  Cycle Both Hobbit and Heir of Numenor. In this order you will get righ way of difficutly increse and players cards order. that how is done by desugners."}]}
