Nowhere does it imply that it replaces the normal. Therefore it is a separate effect.\n\n3) Guarded -> Why wouldn't you be able to engage a guarding enemy? It says it takes an action to claim it. So you can claim it any time you can take an action.\n\n4) Shadow Cards -> Why wouldn't you deal it one? It is an enemy engaged with a player.\n\n5) Nazgul -> This was covered in the FAQ.\n\n \n\nHope that helped."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47608-how-does-scenario-3-work-should-be-in-faq/?do=findComment&comment=477648","commentId":477648,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1306845427,"content":"Doom1502 said:\n\nAs for the other questions, I'd like to know some answers to those too.

Only one ally can be played, TOTAL, per turn by all players combined.\n\n2. The torch says to increase by 2, and it is an entirely separate effect from the normal increase at turn end, so that would be 3 total.\n\n3. The attatched cards are treated as they normally would be. Enemies engage, attack and can be attacked, locations can be traveled to and explored, treachery cards affect play as usual. When an objective is free from cards it can be claimed as stated on the card itself (presently, all available objectives are claimed as actions).\n\n4. The orc guards are \"treated as enemies\" and so get shadow cards like any other enemy.\n\n5. As mentioned, the Nazgûl can´t be trapped, but any other enemy which can is still dealt a shadow card, but is never resolved since the enemy never attacks. As mentioned on p.20 in the rules, all shadow cards are then discarded at the end of combat.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47608-how-does-scenario-3-work-should-be-in-faq/?do=findComment&comment=477824","commentId":477824,"userName":"Ileopsoas","timestamp":1306860465,"content":"Ok you confirmed what i did till now.\n\nI discarded my orc cards and gave them shadow cards!\n\nBut I still have a doubt:what happened after i discard an objective I control?It goes in the encounter discard pile?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47608-how-does-scenario-3-work-should-be-in-faq/?do=findComment&comment=477841","commentId":477841,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1306862518,"content":"Just a side question on Guarded.
