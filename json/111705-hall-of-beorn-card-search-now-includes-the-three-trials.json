I like the art on stage 1 a lot, would love to have a high-res version. Also, can anyone who has read the inserts tell me a bit about the story? What does the Dunland Trap end in? Why are we trying to get this Antlered Crown and for what, and what happens at the end? Do the heroes get it or are they stopped? A short summary of the story so far would be great.

But at the last moment, the leader of the Wild Men lifts his hand to halt the attack. \"Wait!\" he commands, his eyes focused of the baggage spilled on the ground. The large Dunlendling bends down to lift a totemic amulet from the ground. As he hold it up to inspect it more closely, you recognize it as one of the artifacts that you recovered from the Orc's lair in Methedras.\n\n \n\n \n\n\"Where did you find this? Tell me!\" the large war-chief demands, a mix of rage and wonder on his face. His composure becomes more thoughtful as he listens to the tale of your errand upon Methedras and your battle with the Orc, Mugash. He turns the amulet in his hand while he listens as if considering what to do. Then, with obvious reluctance, he gestures for the other Wild Men to lower their spears.\n\n \n\n \n\n\"You are our prisoners now,\" the fierce leader growls. With a jerk of his bearded head, he speaks a command to the other Dunlendlings, and the heroes are bound and marched to the Wild Men's village. \n\n \n\n \n\nUpon your arrival, the warriors escorting you are greeted by savage cheers from the other Dunlendlings. Lifting a hand for quiet, the war-chief adresses his people. \"The straw-heads took our land,\" he says with disdain, \"but the Boar Clan will reclaim what is ours!\" Then, lifting the amulet in his hand, he adds, \"As we have reclaimed this!\"\n\n \n\n \n\nA quiet falls on the crowd and you can see looks of amazement on their faces. \"This amulet belongs to the Boar Clan,\" says the war-chief in a loud voice. Turning to face you, he continues, \"As do you, and everything you carry.\"\n\n \n\n \n\nAt his command, the other Dunlendlings begin pawing through your belongings, until a shout of discovery catches the war-chief's attention. One of his warriors hands him a small bag. \"A rich bounty you have brought us,\" he remarks, holding Saruman's purse in his hands. To the your dismay, he turns it over, spilling a rain of precious golden coins into the ground.\n\n \n\n \n\nAs the Dunlendling women begin lighting bonfires for a victory feast, the Wildmen leader approaches you and speaks quietly, \"Tonight, my people celebrate our victory.\" He still holds the mysterious amulet in his hands, as if it were very previous to him. \"Tomorrow, we will deal with you.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111705-hall-of-beorn-card-search-now-includes-the-three-trials/?do=findComment&comment=1170905","commentId":1170905,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1406365637,"content":"It is my first time when i get a pack straight away in the day when release article was on FFG forum.

But on the other hand, it's a crown, so I guess it wasn't so hard to guess that. "}]}
