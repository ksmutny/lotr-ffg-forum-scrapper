I like how it is a self-contained quest (quick set up time), but more importantly it tests willpower and combat capabilities really well by making you start out with 3 enemies in the staging area and has high threat locations and even puts restrictions on traveling to certain ones. And best of all, it has a big, nasty boss enemy, the Witch King, to really challenge your willpower and combat power.\n\n \n\nIf I build a deck that can consistently defeat this quest, I know I have built something great.

Since HoN I have had to change my deck building quite a bit, and it seems like many quests can through a curve ball in what you will be questing with at any given round. Many decks now need to be tweaked to overcome certain challneges to each scenario. Unless it is well rounded enough to handle questing on each front. That's what makes outlands so powerful for any type of quest.\n\nif I want to see if the deck can really stand up to a challenge I'll play Into Ithilien and Siege of Cair Andros.\n\nBut i have taken decks through those two scenarios that can't win your basic willpower quests.\n\nSo many of the scenarios seem to have major twists (AJtR) that I am not sure that playing any one scenario will be the key to making a deck that is sucessfiul for all other scenarios. But Seventh Level is still my faviorite, because it is a fun quest,, which can be unpredictably challenging at times.\n\nHere are some of the things that make it a good deck tester:\n\nEnemies:\n\n1. Has low engagment cost enemies of 15 and 20 that get a signifigcant increase to attack value if undefended.\n\n2. Has 2 copies of 6 attack cave troll with engagment of 33 which has repercussions if you chump block with 1 hp ally, also has a threat of 4.\n\n3. Orc horn blower blows. surge and when revealed add another card to staging area. Surviving these moments really tests a deck.\n\n4. Goblin warchief 8 attack on when revealed engagment 27. Could be a hero killer early on\n\n5. Goblin archer engagment cost 48 will be dealing damage from staging area when goblins are revealed.\n\n6. One goblin has a threat of 3 and can only be engaged when your threat is below 25 or above 37.\n\n7. It has 3 copies of Watchful Eyes treachery which attaches to hero and if they are exhausted by the end of combat add a card to staging area.\n\n8. A shadow card will add that enemy (revealed shadow) to the staging area.\n\n9. Another shadow will remove a defending ally from the game, thus making the attack undefended. With most enimes that will destroy a hero.\n\n10. Another shadow adds +1 to enemy attack +3 if Goblin, another hero killer.\n\n11. Locations are average difficulty, one has doomed 2. Threat ranges from 2-3, and one location has 7 quest points.\n\n12. 2nd quest card has the potental to add two cards to the staging area each round if the second card is an enemy.\n\nAll these factors combined in a small deck make the scenario perform some what similarly each game, which is usually not the case for other scenarios which have large encounter decks, where each play can have very differnt results from the encounter deck. That's one of the reasons it is good to test new decks and see how they compare to other decks. Even though game play may be similar, there are lots of things that make it very unpredictable and things can go wrong in a hurry.\n\nThe one advantge you get is the Book of Mazrabul, which allows a hero to not exhaust to commit to a quest, but they can only defened and not attack. This only last for the first round. So, it is good to keep this in mind when building a deck since you will be given a free action that will not be granted on other quests. This has not really been a problem in transitioning a deck from SL to other scenarios.\n\nAnd the last reason is maybe I just like easy scenarios since it is rated difficulty 3."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94492-the-best-acid-test-quest/?do=findComment&comment=921893","commentId":921893,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1386084073,"content":"When I look at the tally I keep on Google Drive of all my wins/losses, the scenario I've played the most is Road to Rivendell. Apart from the Sleeping Sentry (Which doesn't come up that much if you're playing solo) I find it to be a well balanced quest (Questing vs Combat) and I love the setting. It's also a great quest to test out sneaky/secrecy decks on, since only 1 enemy is below 21 engagement.\n\n \n\nI'm not a huge fan of Journey Down the Anduin like everyone else. I find that the Troll fight at the beginning demands a very combat heavy deck and is very different than the average quest, so not a good \"acid test\" quest.\n\n \n\nI also like Seventh Level as a middle of the road quest. (It also scales really well for four players)\n\nEdited December 3, 2013 by Narsil0420"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94492-the-best-acid-test-quest/?do=findComment&comment=921922","commentId":921922,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1386086221,"content":"I've been using Passage, Journey and Massing, but have been getting bored with them so thanks for the suggestions.
