Because it's not a competitive game, there's really no need, and it would also cramp the game's design space, after so much effort was already put into the original design. What would they do... Go back and start at Mirkwood all over again? Design a second-best test of will or steward of Gondor? That sounds like a wasted opportunity and not the best marketing pitch.\n\nI hope they never do a second edition, but that they just keep going. Harad is a good place for newer players to jump in. A large reason why I stopped playing Decipher's LOTR TCG after a number of years was because they basically created a second edition that required new cards and substantial new investment to stay competitive.

Because it's not a competitive game, there's really no need, and it would also cramp the game's design space, after so much effort was already put into the original design. What would they do... Go back and start at Mirkwood all over again? Design a second-best test of will or steward of Gondor?

In this way you don't have to buy the whole huge amount of expansions to be \"competitive\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/239289-prediction-gen-con-2017-announces-lotrlcg-2nd-editionthoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2939050","commentId":2939050,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1503231429,"content":"It's great to hear that the game keeps going!\n\nI wonder why don't make \"Big Box\" editions of the cycles...it would make it easier for both consumers and retailers (since they'd only have to stock one product per past cycle). Guess the only one \"losing\" would be FFG with extra production expenses, but it might drive sales of the old cycles to compensate for that..."}]}
