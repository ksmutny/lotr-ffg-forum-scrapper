Khazad-dum has given us dwarf cards, and Dwarrowdelf, from all the official announcements, is set to give us dwarf and elf cards, so to bookend that, it makes sense (to me) to produce something with an Elven theme. Maybe after all our ferretting around in Moria for Elrond, we get to gambol back to Rivendell and make a report. I don't know. Doesn't seem to be much in the way of scope for adventure in that, however.\n\nSeeing a card like Good Meal in Redhorn Gate got me thinking that they must be poised to give us more hobbits, though, and hopefully we won't get the bland \"wandering took\" type this time. Making a Shire-themed box though seems to pose the same problem as a Rivendell box (to me) - isn't the Shire meant to be a place where nothing bad has happened, where the hobbits just got on with their lives until the scouring near the end of the trilogy? I can't remember now, but aside from wanting the player cards, there doesn't seem (to me) to be the opportunity for much adventure there. Maybe this is why I'm not a game designer, though!\n\nAll this talk of iconic locations has got me thinking though - will we likely be seeing any player location cards? AGoT and W:I include such things as support cards, providing bonuses etc while they're out in play. The idea of setting Rivendell down to provide all your Elf chaps some sort of bonus, much like Khazad! Khazad! does for dwarves but with a bit more permanency, does appeal to me.

Anyway, I feel a set focusing on teh white city would be sweet and the art would be awesome.\n\nAlso I forget the name but that spooky area that all the undead cursed people live that Aragorn rallies for the war. Undead are always cool for art sake and I think that the dead marshes was a wasted opportunity to see some spooky stuff... I think the themeing of this area would also make a fantastic setting for the game.\n\n7775589.png [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7775589/img/7775589.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=607092","commentId":607092,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1332093645,"content":"dunharrow/dwimorberg- and great idea with gondor"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=607101","commentId":607101,"userName":"twm47099","timestamp":1332095966,"content":"SiCK_Boy said:\n\n Tornak: FFG established that the timeline for the game's adventures resides between the end of The Hobbit and Bilbo's birthday party in The Fellowship of the Ring.\n\n\n\nActually from the rule book:\n\n\"These quests take place during a timespan of 17 years: from when Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday (and Frodo’s 33rd) to days just prior to Frodo’s leaving the Shire.\"  Although they obviously have broken that with Frodo at least.\n\nI think that the time period you mentioned has a lot of potential, but would require some cards mods / deletions -- Bilbo with the ring, no Frodo, teen age Aragon, Boromir, and Eowyn (bad images of heros in high school), the turning of Saruman, etc.  I still think a deluxe in this time period will probably be issued when the movie comes out.  FFG could do it well, or they could really break things.\n\nTom\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61955-new-deluxe/?do=findComment&comment=607104","commentId":607104,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1332097372,"content":" Aragorn would be fine.
