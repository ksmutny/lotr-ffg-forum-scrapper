They have simplest abilities than the Sand of Harad Legolas/Gimli, who could be a bit head-scratching at first for your wife. Moreover, Sp Eowyn and Tactics Legolas in particular are really good at what they do: questing and killing enemies. Questing and fighting are the main part of the game, if you think about it, and I tend to give the \"kill enemies\" deck to any newbie I wish to introduce to the game.\n\nAlso, with a Sp Eowyn and Tac Gimli / Legolas, you can just include all the staples of spirit and tactics, barring theme, and always selecting the cards that have the most understandable/simple effects. I'm sure your wife is as clever as anyone, but as experienced players, it's easy to forget that this game requires massive text-conversion and a lot happens on the board.  Just go x3 for each card (and don't mind for uniques as Eowyn can ditch them for willpower) the less different cards she has, the less time she will spend reading them and I think she will enjoy.\n\nThis lets you handle the more subtle parts of the game, and try giving her the most amazing tools: card draw, healing, etc. Still, you're right, keep it simple also for your deck so she can understand what you do.\n\nI'd stick with Core Set heroes again, and go for Théodred (as Eowyn's brother), Lea Aragorn and Beravor.\n\nI could come up with two decks if you want.\n\nFinally, consider playing Easy Mode.\n\nHope this helps anyway!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/246262-wife-finally-agreed-to-play/?do=findComment&comment=2714093","commentId":2714093,"userName":"pixcalcis","timestamp":1491136602,"content":"I think banania is spot on."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/246262-wife-finally-agreed-to-play/?do=findComment&comment=2714145","commentId":2714145,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1491143684,"content":"Technically, Théodred is Éowyn's cousin.

At first I gave them some decks, which I considered easy to Play (like dwarfs or outlands), but I underestimated the amount of reading and keeping Things in mind. For me it's obvious that my dwarf gets buffed from an other Players dain, but for them it was not. \n\nLong Story short: We went back and started a Progression style Play, starting with only 2 core-sets. It was a much better experience for them. Maybe because we already played some games before, but I find that the core-set and it's Cards are perfect for beginners and with am experienced Player you don't have to fear the Troubles of a hill troll or dol guldur so much.\n\nSo I'd advice you to follow banania's tips: Go with the core-set heroes (dual spheres teach from the get go how the ressource System works), as many core-set Cards as possible and start at least with  mirkwood and anduin. If you dare bring out Dol Guldur you could even alter the rules that only one of your heroes can be captured an non of her."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/246262-wife-finally-agreed-to-play/?do=findComment&comment=2716040","commentId":2716040,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1491263959,"content":"After a lot of thinking I'm leaning towards Banania's original suggestion as well.  If she likes the game (and isn't just humoring me) we will probably want to go progression style anyway, so \"core only\" is probably the place to go."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/246262-wife-finally-agreed-to-play/?do=findComment&comment=2717226","commentId":2717226,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1491330735,"content":"You might still want to include some cards that are not core in her deck. I'd go for the good questers (Ally Arwen, Escort from Edoras, Galadriel's Handmaidens, Ethir Swordsmen), a few key attachments and easy-themed one (Ancient Mathom, Unexpected Courage, Blades of Gondolin, Citadel Plate, Windfola, Arod), the Northern Trackers, and a few key events (Test of Will, Feint, Hasty stroke), alongside the Gandalfs, Defender of Rammas, Archer of Galadhon. It's already 17 cards x3 = 51 cards. All cards have simple effects. Just go all in for her deck! Maybe there's the spirit resource curve is a bit steep here but...\n\nThrow the **** Steward of Gondor on Eowyn as soon as you grab it!! That way, she gets to do the questing, the killing, and play whatever she likes with her thousand resources.\n\nNow that I think of it, you could swap the Mathom (as you'll surely get her the cards anyway) for Lays of Nimrodel. Nothing like power questing you partners to victory with the mountain of spirit resources you're sitting on.\n\nAlso, I don't know her experience with coop games, but it can be unsettling at first doing things for other people in a game.

Basically set the hook with the correct bait so that you catch the best fish. BT wants to catch his wifes interest in the best way to let her enjoy the game to its best rather than experiencing un-fun play :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nI find progression style was best to learn the game and the first cycle is fantastic for that. Id say as long as you warn ahead about the difficulty of Anduin and Dol-Guldur so that losses at those does not discourage. Best of luck."}]}
