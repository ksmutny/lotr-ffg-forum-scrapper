At the very end, nearing defeat, I decide not to give up but instead play it out. After blocking the enemies that I can, there is one left which must go undefended - an attack that will kill a hero and seal my fate. I flip the shadow card and the Misty Mountain Eagle kills the attacking enemy. With my heroes alive, I barely manage to kill Bolg the following turn and win the game, all thanks to the perfect timing of my eagle friend.

I got Sword that was Broken, Legacy of Numenor, Steward of Gondor, Gaining Strength, and Naith Guide on the first turn. Played LoN to get 2 resources on everyone. Played GS on Celeborn to have 3 and played StwB onto Aragorn. Then played SoG onto Aragorn (who now is Leadership thanks to StwB) then used SoG to pay for Naith Guide.\n\nSpent 7 resources (with 2 left on Galadriel) on turn 1!\n\nThen quested for 10 while only exhausting Aragorn:\nAragorn = 2 + 1StwB\nCeleborn = 3 + 1StwB (no exhaust thanks to Naith Guide)\nNaith Guide = 1 + 1Celeborn + 1StwB (no exhaust thanks to Galadriel)\n\n \n\nI still barely won that game(Hunt for Gollum) - even though I was never felt like I needed more power - because I had a Clue with a Hunters from Mordor on it... then proceded to draw another clue, which was guarded by... another clue, which was guarded by another Hunters from Mordor! That's16 threat just from the Hunters! Failing that questing brought my threat up to 48! Thank god for Strider or I wouldn't have made it past the next refresh phase (I had OHaUH Gandalf out, so it woulda put me over 50).\n\nEdited May 29, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107328-best-feeling-ever/?do=findComment&comment=1102470","commentId":1102470,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1401405073,"content":"Jozim007: wow!

The action advantage is amazing with Galadriel, Naith Guide, and OHaUH Gandalf! Galadriel keeps the new characters up and Naith Guide keeps the heroes up. Wingfoot + Henemarth kept Aragorn up. This is the first time I've ever played a Spirit deck with fewer than 3 Unexpected Courage cards and you really don't need them. The only reason I have them is so I use both Galadriel's action and Nenya's action in the same round, rather than choosing one, but honestly, with Sword that was Broken and Celeborn, you rarely need Galadriel's willpower. -1 threat and an extra card each round is plenty good for me, especially when you have Gandalf. Once you have a good resource generator (Steward of Gondor), The Tree People's \"cost\" of returning an ally to your hand is actually a good thing, since you can easily afford to play it again, and then that ally can be buffed up again and not need to exhaust to quest that round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107328-best-feeling-ever/?do=findComment&comment=1302226","commentId":1302226,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1413487338,"content":"At the moment I would have to say the end of the last game I played (I may still be grinning like a loon).
