Similar to the Song cards that you will see soon in the Mirkwood cycle, these cards give the hero an extra icon only. This allows the hero to pay for cards from multiple spheres, which is great in multi-sphere decks, but does not give him an extra resource per turn. \n\nGlad you like the game so far!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76736-noob-question/?do=findComment&comment=743019","commentId":743019,"userName":"teajay33","timestamp":1357344100,"content":"wish it was two resources but i understand now. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n \n\nthanks! for the clarification!"}]}
