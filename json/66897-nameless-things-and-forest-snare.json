But allies represent a gigantic can of worms. Apart from their abilities, what's stopping you from using those allies to quest, defend, or attack? Per the FAQ, they are attachments in addition to being characters; being attached does not strip them of their ally designation. They are in play, and, as I have suggested above, there's little reason to suppose that you wouldn't control them.

I can interpret the rules to make this work to my advantage **** the intent\" FF seems to not really be on to how card games work in an official format and seem to come from a board game \"let the players sort it out\" stand point. Now maybe I have high standards being a long time CCG player and playing mainly the only game that could keep a set of cards balanced and almost errata free for 14 years (The only banned cards were for how annoying/ time consuming they were for tourny play) and not all card games can be made by the master after he learned from his mistakes (that mistake was M:TG). Can't we as players move beyond that. Do we need tiny text on every card or a massive rule book to stop obvious abuse? Can't we untie the hands of the developers to let them make a cool card without having to dig into every interaction to see if they need to rephrase something or add an addenda to the rules? I've played every type of game-from the play it like a tourny-strict V:tES that does have every interaction mapped out to the most free form rules ever made-Amber. The game that got me started with FFG was the aGoT CCG; I remember playing a B-rath rush deck from the base set. Then I took a break and my deck was obsolete there were rules I never heard of card types that were foreign. That game had bad power creep. After that FFG was off my radar for a while Then I found the best board game ever made-Arkham Horror-every time I played that game I was sure we were going to lose and scrambled around making sacrifices and barely pulling through, every time. Every game was nail biting intense almost lose but out of 50 games I think the total losses were about 4, Then I found the LotR board game- you think anything in this is hard or has a steep learning curve-play that. That wasn't \"going to lose we are going to lose, we won!\" like Arkham it was just \"we are going to lose, we lost\".  The ideas behind a co-op game board and card are new and don't fit into the heroic ideal we expect. FFG picked 2 great places to use this (Lovecraft and Tolkein). Both worlds depict comparatively helpless people fighting against overwhelming odds. It's safe to assume that if there are 2 ways to look at how a card works the one you don't like is the right one.  The Lord of the Rings book is a Eucatastrophe. The idea of the card game is that you fulfill the role of Frodo, the game makes the rules, the encounter deck is there to hurt you, the game is designed to make you lose. Do you have what it takes to win? Everything is stacked against you, accept that your fate is a cruel one and overcome."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66897-nameless-things-and-forest-snare/?do=findComment&comment=658511","commentId":658511,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1342270041,"content":"just Logan said:\n\nNow maybe I have high standards being a long time CCG player and playing mainly the only game that could keep a set of cards balanced and almost errata free for 14 years (The only banned cards were for how annoying/ time consuming they were for tourny play) and not all card games can be made by the master after he learned from his mistakes (that mistake was M:TG).

A game which hasn't seen official support since 1999?\n\nI really don't understand what point you're trying to make.\n\nI think most high-level players would actually quite like to see a ruleset for this game that is as well-templated and specific as Magic's.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66897-nameless-things-and-forest-snare/?do=findComment&comment=705651","commentId":705651,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1349505172,"content":"MyNeighbourTrololo said:\n\nIt makes no sense in terms of game rules.\n\nAttachment card types are attached during the planning phase by the player.\n\nPlayer cards from player deck are attached to Elder Things when they engage, and by sharing the same word \"attach\" - it's a completely diffrent mechanic, attaching all - events, attachments, allies.
