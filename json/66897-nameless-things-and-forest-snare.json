That's fool proof logic btw. Hell, the Nameless Things' card text explicitely states that these cards are attached to it, so why on earth shouldn't they be attachments? And once they're \"attached\", the \"when attached…\" bit of Forest Snare triggers as long as nothing else explictely prevents that from happening. Like \"cards text are blank\" or \"Chuck Norris once escaped a Forest Snare\" or something like that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66897-nameless-things-and-forest-snare/?do=findComment&comment=653558","commentId":653558,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1341367800,"content":"Yea, whatever, do what you want, make game easier for yourself in whatever way you find comfortable.
