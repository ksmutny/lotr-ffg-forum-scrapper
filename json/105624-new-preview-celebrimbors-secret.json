I don't think there's any mention of a linkage between her and the ents, so thematically it's fine that they don't synergize.\n\nI really like how they did Galdriel. It's a bit annoying that she is so limited (especially without attachments) and has so little versatility, but with Nenya and Unexpected Courage on her, she offers a LOT, though still very narrowly-focused. Her ability also allows her to get to the important attachments more quickly.\n\nThematically, I think she is about as spot on as they come.

The great thing about the design of the two is that you need not have them together like Elladan and Elrohir but it makes totally sense to. But who the third with the current pool?

Going off blue means that you'll likely lose a lot of the questing advantage as your allies will cost 2-3 and often have 1 or 0 willpower, which is nice but not amazing given her weaknesses. As a standalone deck, she would work best with Grima to power out worthwhile cards and manage threat. As a support deck, I could see her and 2x Tactics heroes, where they are dedicated combat and she just manages their threat and draws cards, while providing cheap Spirit cards. You'd lose out on most of the questing advantage, but it'd probably be worth it (so long as the other decks can pick up the slack)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105624-new-preview-celebrimbors-secret/?do=findComment&comment=1074761","commentId":1074761,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1399410877,"content":"Galadriel... that is just darn cool.  Really like how unique she is, and that is a really strong ability."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105624-new-preview-celebrimbors-secret/?do=findComment&comment=1074770","commentId":1074770,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1399411276,"content":"Does anyone else feel like the elven aesthetic is awfully similar to the one in the films?

For instance:\n\nI own Galadriel and I play Arwen down this turn. On the normal scheme of things Arwen can now quest without exhausting. The question is when is this rule \"checked\"\n\nIf it's \"Do you own Galadriel at the time that you play Arwen, that means that Arwen can now quest without exhausting.\" Or is it checked only in the quest phase which would be, \"Arwen was played this round and you own Galadriel during the quest phase, therefore Arwen doesn't exhaust to quest now\"\n\nIt depends if in rules terms, the ability to exhaust without questing is only checked at the quest stage or whether it's a property that the Arwen card gains as a result of being played while a Galardriel card is in play under your control.\n\nThe first instance would only allow the player who owns Galadriel during the quest phase to benefit, the second would allow you to play desperate alliance during the planning phase (after playing your own allies down) to get a double benefit from her.\n\nCurrently nothing could occur in between playing Arwen and questing to knock Galadriel out of play - but you could imagine a future encounter card effect that did interupt between planning and the quest phase such that Galadriel was alive when you played Arwen, but dead by the time you actually went to quest. In that instance I would find it more logical to assume that Arwen can still quest without exhausting even though you no longer have Galadriel (that would make it a property that has been bestowed on the Arwen card like a stack in magic).\n\nHowever other effects in the game so far have tended to work on a simpler check system (do you have the cards in play 'now' at the moment they apply) So I suspect that the rules response will be only the player who owns Galadriel in the quest phase benefits.\n\nI'd say it was worth a rules clarification though because both rules readings are legitimate.\n\nEdited May 7, 2014 by Rapier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105624-new-preview-celebrimbors-secret/?do=findComment&comment=1074989","commentId":1074989,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1399421798,"content":"> ...\n\n\"Allies you control, do not exhaust to commit to the quest during the round they enter play\" \n\n \n\nThis is a passive effect which only applies when you are committing your characters to the quest. Each player commits any of their characters to the quest at one time, starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise in order. There is a player action window in between each player committing their characters to the quest, so you can use Galadriel and Desperate alliance to have two players' character quest without exhausting.\n\n1. First player controls Galadriel and commits their characters to the quest. Any of the first players' characters which entered play this round do not exhaust.\n\n2. First player plays Desperate Alliance and passes Galadriel to the second player.\n\n3. Second player commits their characters to the quest. Now that they control Galadriel, her passive applies to any of the second players' characters which entered play this round. Those characters do not exhaust.\n\n \n\nThis passive effect, just like the one on Light of Valinor, is only checked at the time a character is committed to the quest.

Torture.\n\n \n\nThere is one more point I wish to make, apart from stating my glorious optimism. All the enthusiasm that pours out of everyone here proves one thing. Generally, players love to get cool and useful toys. I think the designers should follow the recent way of Celeborn, Grima or Galadriel, meaning that they should issue player cards that makes us all go \"wow, so many uses, can't wait to this or that combo\". I mean we should abandon once and for all the concept of all those spirit Pippins that are useful, but only when you have 100% hobbit heroes, or with Theodens whose buffs mean anything only in few cases. Galadriel is fun, multi-optional, fits in variety of decks, and makes you take decisions. Flexibility means fun. Combos are cool. More power in the hands of the player means more creativity, more tabletop drama, even for the price of much more difficult scenarios. Bring it, FFG, you have just proved you are perfectly capable."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105624-new-preview-celebrimbors-secret/?do=findComment&comment=1075557","commentId":1075557,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1399473962,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > I might be a moron but I think Miravor could potentially be a better fit for her than UC if you have other card draw in the deck.  She turns Miravor into an instant power card IMHO.\n> > > \n> > >  \n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > Hmmm...why do you think Miruvor would be better with Galadriel?

You can have more powerful card effects if you allow them to be more restricted - if all cards were unrestricted you would lose a lot of the flavour of the different traits and races.\n\nIt adds to Galadriel's flavour that she was willing to help anyone against the shadow (as she was in the books) - where as Thorin was only interested in dwarfs (as were most of his company - hence their hero designs), if they were both unrestricted they would both be less flavorful (though Thorin would just be more powerful).\n\nI'm not sure that spirit pippin is good enough in his power level to justify 100% hobbits - on the other hand being able to guarantee you don't engage an enemy - ever, is pretty nice. I would say that at 3 threat cost it should have been not just hobbits - but if it had been cost 1 threat 100% hobbits would have been justified. (We may see a resurgence of spirit pippin with the new hobbit support we've gotten, but I doubt it because the lore version is so good, and lore is a better sphere for hobbits to get access too)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105624-new-preview-celebrimbors-secret/?do=findComment&comment=1075675","commentId":1075675,"userName":"Style75","timestamp":1399478782,"content":"SOLID GOLD ! ! !\n\n \n\nCaleb and Matt really deliver with these new cards.

The Light of Valinor represents the wisdom and enhanced state that the Noldor were granted by actually living in Valinor and learning directly from the Valar (and Maiar). The attachment represents this power and higher state of being (best exemplified by Frodo seeing Glorfindel as a being of pure light when he is in his wraith-like state). Silvan (and Sindar) never made it to Valinor, and so they technically aren't on the same level and never received this instruction. I can buy a thematic justification that the Silvan can benefit from Light of Valinor indirectly by being taught by the Noldor (such as Galadriel teaching her people), but it's just interesting because the main and primary distinction between Noldor and Silvan is whether or not they lived in Valinor."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105624-new-preview-celebrimbors-secret/?do=findComment&comment=1085566","commentId":1085566,"userName":"ana4","timestamp":1400148004,"content":"Yeah, it should be only Noldor and not be unique.
