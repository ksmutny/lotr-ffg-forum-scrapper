Having Bilbo in the game, having effectively 2 Heroes with third just sorta around for his ability does seem weak. Legolas, while he can't quest any better than Bilbo, has a huge upside in combat. Not only can he take an undefended attack damage from most enemies, when he attacks, he usually gives you progress tokens and with his Ranged, he can attack Enemies engaged to another player. I'm still twiddling with the starter decks but no way I'm even thinking of swapping out Beravor for Bilbo, let alone Denethor or Glorfindel.\n\nIf I can avoid it, I don't want my Heroes defending, Allies are there to die for that. Only exception I might make is Denethor with Protector of Lorien, 4 Defense kicks ass, but then, why would I want Bilbo when I could have Denethor and/or Beravor. Even if you have to exhaust Beravor, she can still contribute by taking undefended damage from some enemies, something Bilbo  categorically cannot do (at least not take and survive).\n\nAlso, Servant, you do think they would make Hero-specific Attachments? Meaning that unless you use Hero X, you can't use Attachment Y. I for one am not seeing FFG going that route. Attachment for a specific Sphere, maybe even a keyword (Dwarf), but not single Hero-specifics. Even if they give Sting/Mithril Coat extra bonus (like Dwarven Axe on a Dwarf), they should also apply to Frodo at least (Frodo's been spoiled)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471310","commentId":471310,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1305803080,"content":"Dam said:\n\nAlso, Servant, you do think they would make Hero-specific Attachments?

a significant advantage should cost more then the sum of the parts like the other heroes.  At 6, Bilbo would be seriously undercosted, 9 might be a little high, but really, gettting an extra card while still having an exhaust available is a tremendous advantage.  Obviously, Bilbo's value decreases with more players, so depending on where they landed with the actual value, 9 is probably still a very good value in solitaire mode, a very poor value in 3-4 players, and just ok in 2 player, if lower, it would be hard to pass up in solitaire (my opinion only)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471422","commentId":471422,"userName":"sWhiteboy","timestamp":1305817451,"content":"Dam

why waste a heal of 2 or \"all\" on someone that only has 1 point of damage?\n\nEdit: To sum up the above, I think that unfortunately it's looking like Bilbo's only use at the moment may be as an attacker, with his unfortunate 1 attack strength.  A hobbit version of Dwarven Axe would do wonders for his attack capability, though.\n\nI have to admit, I am a little puzzled by having him be Threat 9, but just like the rest of you I am dying to see what cards may be released that might make him more convincing to use.  I really think it's going to be up to card synergy to either make or break this hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471532","commentId":471532,"userName":"TrooperShark99","timestamp":1305834786,"content":"Card draw is that strong in card games, under costed card draw broke more games and cause more errata's in CCG's then any other game mechanic.  9 Might be on the high side, but I can understand FFG not wanting to under cost a free card draw engine out of the chute.  If he was cost at 6, this game would now be a Bilbo Lore + 2 heroes of your choice deck building game for mono and 2 player games.  It's simple, as long as he is alive, he DOUBLES your access to cards that help you win games.\n\n \n\nWith only the core set cards, without having seen the card, I would have guessed the threat cost to be 8, but in my opinion, 9 is better then 6 for this card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471569","commentId":471569,"userName":"Carnivean","timestamp":1305843083,"content":"We already have \"Exhaust a Spirit character to do X\" cards.\n\nI can see more cards in this vein and when an \"Exhaust a Lore character to do X\" cards start appearing, in addition to the card draw, Bilbo will come into his own.  We are judging him on current card pool and about 3-4 spoiled cards, hardly fair on the little chap!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471605","commentId":471605,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1305853326,"content":"Lightdarker said:\n\nBryon said:\n\n \n\nThat is a good point about having the exhaust left on Bilbo, but what are you going to use Bilbo's exhaust to do?\n\nQuesting is too dangerous, since he has such little HP and the Treachery card that wounds all exhausted characters could be brutal against him.\n\nDefending is too dangerous, since a +1 shadow card allows a 3 strength enemy to kill Bilbo.\n\nAttacking is all there is left, and his attack value is only a 1.  Hardly worth it.\n\n \n\n \n\nIf you're worried about The Necromancer's Reach, remember too that Dol Guldur Orcs are also a potential draw in every single scenario so far, and if you're the first player, that 2 damage is enough to drop Bilbo instantly.\n\n\n\nA  bit off topic but I think I might be playing Dol Guldur Orcs differently to you so wanted to clarify the above point.\n\nWhen Dol Guldur Orcs is revealed, do you make the first player choose one of their characters committed to the quest to take the damage?\n\nI read the card to mean the first player must simply choose a character committed to the quest to take the damage, so he could choose another players character if he wanted.\n\nTherefore the chance of Bilbo being \"the one\" is relatively unlikel (in our games anyway).\n\nAm I playing Dol Guldur Orcs wrongly?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471607","commentId":471607,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1305853804,"content":"Ya know, I had always just assumed the first player had to choose a character they control, but you're right, reading the card it does specifically say \"The first player chooses 1 character currently committed to a quest.
