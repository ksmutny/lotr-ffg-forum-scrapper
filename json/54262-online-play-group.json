It's a bit different since one person would have to control the encounter deck while the other player(s) would have to rely on this player to know what is going on in the encounter, but I think it wouldn't be too bad.\n\nI've only played online with a real life friend before, but I was thinking since I think we've got a nice community here we could maybe play online with each other. I, for one, think it would be great to play with some of you. This is also a great chance for those who don't have any other players nearby to play with others.\n\nIf this works out well I'd consider setting up some sort of online league on my website.\n\nAnyone interested?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54262-online-play-group/?do=findComment&comment=537656","commentId":537656,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1317847808,"content":"I'd be keen to give it a go.

Point the cameras at your playing area and play like normal. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nIt's not quite the same of course. The best way to go about it I've found is to have any player drawing or playing a card simply read off the card name and the text on the card if necessary. For LotR one player will have the encounter deck setup and will do all the work with that. You probably won't be able to read the text on other players' cards, but you can probably tell a number of them just from pictures or watching where they are placed as the player plays them. If necessary you can just ask the other player about the cards they have out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54262-online-play-group/?do=findComment&comment=537693","commentId":537693,"userName":"Will Fuqua","timestamp":1317855319,"content":" I think it's a great idea.  I was actually suggesting it to a friend of mine i play over the phone with.  i don't even need to get my laptop out, I can use my ipad with Skype using the back camera while it's proped up in landscape mode.  If anyone wants my username to play some time it's will.fuqua"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54262-online-play-group/?do=findComment&comment=537695","commentId":537695,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1317855771,"content":"I'll be in it, why not just use lackeyccg ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54262-online-play-group/?do=findComment&comment=537697","commentId":537697,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1317855821,"content":"booored said:\n\nI'll be in it, why not just use lackeyccg ?\n\n\n\nWe COULD use something like that or OTCGN but personally I prefer real cards. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54262-online-play-group/?do=findComment&comment=537712","commentId":537712,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1317859154,"content":"Well we all would rather use cards, but that isn't the point.\n\nI think it would be so much easier, I mean how can you play with out it.. you would need some way of getting a camera to a location were you can use a table space. So even if you had a laptop you would need to pick it up all the time and point it about the place to see everything. Then reposition it so you can see the screen. Things like LackeyCCG are designed just for this kind of thing and would be the way to go imo.

I played on the floor, but you should have plenty of space on a table. Remember you only need half the playing space, so you can place the laptop where the other player would be set up.
