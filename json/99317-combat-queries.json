My first thought is no. Answer?\n\n \n\nNext I was wondering if I play a card (ex. Foe-Hammer) that makes me exhaust a weapon attachment I control does that attachment still have it's affect on the character or is it considered useless until refreshed?\n\n \n\nKinda feel dumb asking these questions, haha! Just want to make sure I'm not fudging any games. \n\n \n\nCHEERS!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99317-combat-queries/?do=findComment&comment=985748","commentId":985748,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1392446240,"content":"> I had built up 2 copies of Quick Strike in my hand and was wondering if I can play this to attack an enemy annoyingly stuck in the staging area. My first thought is no. Answer?\n\n \n\nNo, it allows you to do a normal combat attack.. just out of turn order.. all normal combat rules apply.\n\n \n\n> Next I was wondering if I play a card (ex.

The attachment still provides its bonus to the attached character."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99317-combat-queries/?do=findComment&comment=988079","commentId":988079,"userName":"Dr. Nocturne","timestamp":1392708804,"content":"THANKS!"}]}
