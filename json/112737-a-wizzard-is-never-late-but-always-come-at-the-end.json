There seems to be a consensus of opinion that if anything ends, it would be Call of Cthulhu.\n\n \n\nFFG has said that the LoTR LCG is a massively and incredibly successful game for them. No company in their right mind would quit making a game that fans are buying! \n\n \n\nAlso the following is very important to consider with LoTR LCG:\n\nWith games like AGoT, to have a fun experience, you need to be relatively competitive. The buy-in right now is enormous. I have been playing AGoT since the beginning, and so still play it a lot. But, if I was looking at the game right now, there is no way I would buy into it. \n\n \n\nLoTR, due to the nature of the game itself, does not and will not have a buy-in problem. The game is cooperative! So, new players right now can get on the on ramp with a core set and maybe a few APs and have loads of fun. This is one LCG where a large card pool really does not affect new players. Actually, this game might be even more appealing for new players, since they know that there is such a rich body of content already established; this is essentially the reverse of the phenomenon that happens with the competitive LCGs. \n\nEdited August 8, 2014 by divinityofnumber"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112737-a-wizzard-is-never-late-but-always-come-at-the-end/?do=findComment&comment=1189450","commentId":1189450,"userName":"gilgalad415","timestamp":1407529452,"content":"That Gandalf is sorta hax.
