Gollum's Forced effect will therefore always occur at the end of the step 3 of the Quest phase. The Capture Forced effect occurs as soon as it is defeated; which in the rules triggers during the step 3 but before its end, as it involves replacing location/quest with the next one and when applicable transferring tokens.\n\nBut even if one consider the two effects were simultaneous, you may still choose which effect precedes the other one by the FAQ rules."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58106-dead-marshes-gollum-forced-effects/?do=findComment&comment=571989","commentId":571989,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1325076802,"content":"Titan said:\n\n \n\nI agree.

In the example, you used Escort from Edoras, whose forced effect triggers after the quest is resolved. Gollum's forced effect triggers at the end of the quest phase, not after quest resolution.

Indeed, the phrasing is different between \"after quest resolves\" and \"at the end of the quest phase\". Sorry for that. So combat/quest resolves = end of last step but before player action window and end of phase = after last player action window.\n\nCan we also say that when a quest is \"defeated\", this takes place at the same time point than a quest being resolved?\n\nI hope we will get a better timing sequence chart in the next FAQ because this becomes a bit complicated..."}]}
