There all elves, just different heritages, traditions and stuff.\n\n\n\nReally agree with booored on this one. \"Sindar\" is the name of one of the Three Kindred of the Eldar; also known as \"Grey-Elves\". These are the only elves that did not return with the Eldar to the Undying Lands early in the First Age (aside from the East Elves or Lesser Elves in the East but that's another story). Wood-Elves are Silvan but are from the Sindarin Kindred.\n\nIntermarriage, as booored put it, is a good reference. Take Celeborn: he is Sindar but he married Galadriel; she's Noldor (Noldor being the second Kindred). This mixing of the second and third Kindreds happened when the Noldor returned to Middle-Earth in chase of Morgoth during the War of the Great Jewels. Beleriand, which is where these Elves dwealt, was sunk into the sea as Morgoth was overthrown and the Elves migrated: Celeborn and his followers traveled across the Misty Mountains to the vale of the Anduin and the forests there (Lothlorien). Thranduil and his followers settled in Greenwood the Great (now MIrkwood) and others that stayed in Lindon were followers of Gil-galad (Noldor).\n\nBasically, to sum it up, Silvan are Sindarin Elves :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59114-legolas-is-wrong/?do=findComment&comment=581579","commentId":581579,"userName":"gamestar10","timestamp":1326927727,"content":"richsabre said:\n\noh yeah and while were on this topic, i noticed neither dain nor brand are noble, i would say being kings, they probably should come under the noble string of traits\n\n\n\nAgree here, also.
