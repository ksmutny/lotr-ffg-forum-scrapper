It has been years since I played it (in 2013). It wasn’t a nightmare version then, of course, yet I still took great pride in beating it with the cardpool of then. And here you are still using Glorfindel as I did, and I really wonder why some seem to shy away from him because I find him to be among the best heroes in the game, probably my favourite, though I would also like to see another version (Tactics) with a great ability (would be even better now with Thorongil). The ally is also amazing but the Lore version..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3947156","commentId":3947156,"userName":"Preotet","timestamp":1590956237,"content":"As I've gathered from reading the forums and listening to some podcasts, he was overplayed. He's powerful and cheap for his stats and was therefore in every deck. That's why players shied away from him. Then came new characters, new combos, new jank. Anyway, that's just the feeling I got, so I could be wrong. But I'm still new to the game so I don't find him boring yet. 😃\n\nThe funny thing about Into Ithilien, I always thought it was the easiest of the three and never had any real big problems with beating it. Well, at first I did, because of my limited cardpool. But at that time, the majority of the quests seemed difficult. I only played Escape from Dol Goldur for the first time a couple of months ago, for example. It gained such a reputation it was almost the last quest I played (not counting unreleased packs from the last cycle)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3947158","commentId":3947158,"userName":"Preotet","timestamp":1590956349,"content":"And I agree, he's one of the best heroes in the game.

I think Pelargir is easier but can get some really nasty combos. Ithilien basically had the Wargs and the Watcher that could destroy the swarms of the time but I hardly ever swarmed.

I also think this could create a loop, where if the only cards left in the deck were Blocking Wargs you would just endlessly reveal and reshuffle them, while also killing all non-immune questing characters."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3947437","commentId":3947437,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1591021784,"content":"I believe originally you shuffled them back to the encounter deck right after reveal and now you don’t any longer but I am by no means certain by this.\n\nLet us talk some of the heroes as I used to in the past but have not done so in years.\n\nI really like the design of Gandalf but I have not built that many good decks with him as others seem to achieve. I do not always shy away from higher threat lineups but the only good decks I ever had with Gandalf ran either Spirit Beregond or Glorfindel.\n\nI find it interesting that the original Eowyn and Beregond were both staple heroes already but received new versions (in opposite sphere) in the Flame of the West which are even much better I would say. Yes, perhaps not always that much better but in general definitely more versatile: low threat cost in Tactics with high willpower is amazing and keeping the threat level (as Beregond usually does) is great too.\n\nI believe what people dislike about Spirit Glorfindel is the lack of positive ability. And I do agree that such a major character, or such an iconic character, and certainly one of the mightiest of the era, should have a card with a mighty ability (and stats... which seem fine as they are). But as I said earlier, I really enjoy the Spirit version, I just wish we would have another powerful version, and the Lore one is a total miss.\n\nEdited June 1 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3947440","commentId":3947440,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1591022039,"content":"Hey, we seemed to have write it simultaneously, ok, so they probably shuffled when the stage was a battle or siege, makes sense.
