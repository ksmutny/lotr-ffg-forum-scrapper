Forth Eorlingas! (morgul vale)- can those Rohan heroes attack together?\n\n2. Fresh tracks (the long dark)- if I choose a \"immune to player cards effects\", does this card triggers its effects? \n\n3. Can I deal damage to \"immune to player card effects\" enemies via Gondorian Spearman or Spear of the Citadel?\n\n4. I just want to be sure about this one. \nIf some weapon- for example Dagger of Westernesse- is exhausted because of Goblin-Cleaver or something else, does it still adds its ATK and other boosts?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99284-few-questions-about-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=985693","commentId":985693,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1392436597,"content":"1.
