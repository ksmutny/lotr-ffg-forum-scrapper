I was going to start a \"campaign\" run through of all the adventure packs with the self imposed restriction of only using the characters that aren't canon, but am unsure whether Fastred qualifies or not. Also Haldan from Roam Across from Rhovanion. Help please. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286078-fastred-and-haldan/?do=findComment&comment=3533434","commentId":3533434,"userName":"Will Anderson","timestamp":1542069323,"content":"Haldan is FFG-created, while Fastred is actually a bit of a grey area. A Fastred is mentioned in the Song of the Mounds of Mundburg (listing heroes who died in the Battle of the Pelannor Fields) but he's no more than a name ('Herefara and Herubrand, Horn and Fastred,\nfought and fell there in a far country'). But Fasted was also the name of Theoden's great uncle, who died fighting the Haradrim with his Gondorion allies. So I think it's Caleb showing off his knowledge of the lore in making a nod to original. Of course, very natural to name someone after a famous fallen hero, so I that's how I imagine it. Whether the LCG character is the same Fastred that rode with Theoden, I think it's left open for you to interpret either way."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286078-fastred-and-haldan/?do=findComment&comment=3533451","commentId":3533451,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1542070497,"content":"> 20 minutes ago, Will Anderson said:\n> \n> Whether the LCG character is the same Fastred that rode with Theoden, I think it's left open for you to interpret either way.\n\nIs it? I thought that the time period of the deluxes and cycles was the 17 year interim between the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, so I don't think it could be Theoden's great uncle.\n\nFurthermore, Fastred's flavor text:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> \"King's man! King's man!\" his heart cried within him.\n\nIs from the Battle of Pelennor Fields, and is referring to King Theoden. So I'm fairly certain this is meant to be the Fastred that rode with Theoden and died on the Pelennor.\n\nEdited November 13, 2018 by Seastan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286078-fastred-and-haldan/?do=findComment&comment=3533468","commentId":3533468,"userName":"Will Anderson","timestamp":1542071675,"content":"No, you're right, it definitely COULDN'T have been Theoden's great-uncle Fastred (well, following the LCG timeline); I never said it could.

I haven't played the scenario that introduces Haldan as an objective ally however, and perhaps that scenario is enough of a backstory that they felt they didn't need to describe he any further with his own fiction. In the case of Fastred, such an obscure mentioning seems like they would have chosen some other Rohan character to create as a new hero. But, it lines up: name Fastred, from Rohan. I feel comfortable using him freely for my purposes though. He'll be the only character with the Rohan trait that I could use in my campaign, without him, there would be a significant portion of the card pool that thematically would be \"unusable\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286078-fastred-and-haldan/?do=findComment&comment=3533598","commentId":3533598,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1542084618,"content":"As a former Lord of the Rings Online player I did already know Fastred as the Reeve of Snowbourn and there he is indeed the one Will refers to."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286078-fastred-and-haldan/?do=findComment&comment=3533601","commentId":3533601,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1542084773,"content":"> 3 hours ago, Will Anderson said:\n> \n> No, you're right, it definitely COULDN'T have been Theoden's great-uncle Fastred (well, following the LCG timeline); I never said it could.

There's no accompanying backstory, which has been the standard for non-canon heroes for a long time. And they've never named a non-canon hero by the same name as a character in the canon.
