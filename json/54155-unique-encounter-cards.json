I found only 2 examples where this \"design rule\" for uniqueness is perhaps broken: The River Ninglor (but you can argue that it's a large river and this location only presents a part of it, so uniqueness is not required), and perhaps the Nazgul of Dol Guldur (but this can be a generic Nazgul card too, for the Witch King is specifically named and unique).\n\n Edit: Ah, I found more examples: The Brown Lands, The East Bight, River Langflood etc... but you can argue that they're big regions, too, and the players have to explore several parts of the Brown Lands. But they missed Chieftain Ufthak (he was the one orc which was caught by Shelob, and the orcs to which Sam is listening speak about him)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54155-unique-encounter-cards/?do=findComment&comment=537123","commentId":537123,"userName":"xBeakeRx","timestamp":1317762082,"content":"There are 2 unique locations in Emyn muil: Amon Lhaw and Amon Hen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54155-unique-encounter-cards/?do=findComment&comment=537235","commentId":537235,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1317785971,"content":"I would assume that at some point FFG may include cards that interact with unique cards in some way, or maybe it's just for completeness. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54155-unique-encounter-cards/?do=findComment&comment=537236","commentId":537236,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1317785989,"content":"Double post. sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54155-unique-encounter-cards/?do=findComment&comment=537240","commentId":537240,"userName":"Vyron2","timestamp":1317786492,"content":" I think it's quite cool storywise :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nGiving encounters uniqueness and individuality adds a certain depth to the encounter deck flavourwise because you don't just think, uuuuh, I'm fighting bats again/exploring a forest, but WOW I'm fighting a SPECIAL enemy, etc. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nmaybe some unique cards will reappear in a different shape (nazgul on fell beast/nazgul on horse/on foot) but you can only use one at a time... or when mixing encounter sets together for individual scenarios... whatever :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"}]}
