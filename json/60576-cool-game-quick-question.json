You can have cards from all 4 spheres in your deck if you want (and heroes from 3 different spheres).

You need a resource match to be able to play a card (page 12 of the rules). So to play Khazad Khazad (a zero cost tactics card) you need to have a hero with a tactics resource pool. You can then remove zero tokens from it to play the card. Without a resource match, you can't play the card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60576-cool-game-quick-question/?do=findComment&comment=595463","commentId":595463,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1329491453,"content":"Memetix said:\n\nBohemond said:\n\n \n\nAlso, you can't play 0 cost cards of a sphere without a hero of that sphere.\n\n \n\n \n\nI believe this is incorrect.
