But I am eager to get such a deck going...\n\n \n\n \n\nThis was the first time I've tinkered with making a mono-Lore deck, but I liked several of the mechanics I got going throughout my game.\n\n \n\n \n\nTo begin with, I used nearly all of the new trap cards as well as the old forest snare ones too.  These cards are great for seizing up enemies in the staging area as well as boosting Faramir's attack.  I put all the new ranger/gondor themed allies in as well and a couple Haldir's.  I really wanted to like the new Ranger Bow attachment, but I really dislike the fact that it makes you exhaust the character as well as the attachment; if it was exhaustion of only the bow, I would love the effect as well as the artwork instead of just the artwork. \n\n \n\nI left out event/attachment healing cards; however I put three copies of Warden of Healing in and got one in play.  Then, from my other set of Leadership/Tactics heroes, I played Steward of Gondor on Mirlonde to give her a resource boost, which in turn allowed the Warden to exhaust/refresh to quickly heal everyone after they took damage.  \n\n \n\nI also put several different cards in to accelerate card draw, such as Mithrandir's Advice, so I could get allies out quick because in the beginning, the low amount of questing willpower was definitely a problem.  After several Gondorian allies came into play, though, it was not so bad.   Finally, I put three Watch Tower Watchmen in to round out the allies and was actually able to use their card effect for the first time ever. \n\n \n\nThe thing I like best about mono-sphere decks is not having to worry about getting cards that you can't afford because nearly all cards can be purchased relatively quickly (especially if one of your heroes has the Steward of Gondor attachment.)  Lore might not be the best sphere to have a mono-deck with, but if you have another deck in play to give them a few boosts, they perform much better.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88175-speculation-about-blood-of-gondor-hero/?do=findComment&comment=838955","commentId":838955,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1376422918,"content":"> On a totally unrelated topic, responding to the above line-up, what was the deck you used?
