I am more into miniature boardgames, so started playing a card game was a new experience to me. First time I played the tutorial scenario I thought: “Help, if this one is this hard, and it is only a level 1, how hard will the next one be?”. As I suppose you figured out, I didn’t understand anything of the game, but now after having played the first two scenarios six times and watch one video I feel I start to understand the game.\n\nSo, what I will do is start from scenario 1 again and see if I have learned anything. I have documented it if anyone is interested. All pictures are from the Quest phase. If you see me doing anything stupid, wrong or missed some rules don’t hesitate to tell me. The card names that are being played are capitalized (for example the first quest card is named Flies and Spiders and you will find that name in Round 1).\n\n \n\nPassage Through Mirkwood\n\nRound 1 – Threat level 32\n\nIn the early morning our three Heroes, Gimli, Aragon and Eowyn, set out from King Thranduil’s palace. They were travelling to Lorien to deliver Queen Galadriel an important message. To get there they followed the Old Forest Road toward the Anduin.\n\nEowyn and Aragon were focused on making progress along the road, while Gimli was looking around for any dangerous animals or other foes. He could hear Hummerhorns nearby, but the only thing he saw was Flies And Spiders. Then suddenly a Forest Spider attacked the party and it gave Gimli a wound! Aragon was ready and came to his rescue, almost killing it.\n\n \n\nRound 2 – Threat level 33\n\nAfter the first attack, in Round 1, Gimli mobilized Unexpected Courage. Eowyn and Aragon continued ahead of the dwarf on their quest to find the path to the Anduin. They continued slowly forward, cautious for the Eyes In The Forest (oops, mistake here. I discarded one event card, not all). Gimli was still fighting the spider, first he blocked an attack from it and then his new courage made it possible to also kill it.\n\n \n\nRound 3 – Threat level 34\n\nThe party continued forward along the road. Suddenly they meet an old friend to Gimli, a Veteran Axehand.\n\nThe killing of the minor spider earlier hadn’t gone unnoticed, it had awakened something much more dangerous, Ungoliant’s Spawn! The spider attacked Gimli, who survived the attack by using a Feint.\n\nThis can’t end well! Gimli doesn’t have unlimited number of Feints, not more than three! Will our heroes be rescued by something much more old and powerful than this spawn?\n\n \n\nRound 4 – Threat level 35\n\nLo and behold, it is Gandalf! A friend in need is a friend indeed, as the old song says! Gandalf had noticed that there were heroes in the neighbourhood that needed to be rescued and came to save them. He jumped into the fry and gave the vile spider a wooping. Gandalf doesn’t do discreet, all the noise attracted a Dol Guldur Beastmaster, who immediately attacked our Heroes.\n\nThe Beastmaster attacked Gimli, who defended himself successfully, which was no problem since he felt he was a Blade Master. The spider attacked the Veteran Axehand, who died horrible. Everyone is a Hero in his/her own story, but this was not the Veteran Axehand’s story, so he had to share the same fate as all other supporting acts, death. Gimli killed the spider, while Aragon and Gandalf together killed the Beastmaster.\n\nAfter melee died down, Gandalf left for other businesses, maybe to visit his old friend Radagast?\n\n \n\nRound 5 – Threat level 36\n\nThe party continued deeper into Mirkwood. Spiders were crawling everywhere in the trees. The party killed another one. Suddenly the party came up to A Fork In The Road. Which way should they chose? Both roads looked equally bad, so they chose one by random.\n\n \n\nRound 6 – Threat level 37\n\nBoth Aragon and Eowyn felt weakened by The Necromancer’s Reach, they were after all close to his domains. The road they were following was getting more and more scary. “Don’t Leave The Path” they warned each other. “There seems to be another Ungoliant’s Spawn around here”, Aragon told the others. “We are safe behind the Thicket Of Spears” Eowyn said confidently.\n\n \n\nRound 7 – Threat level 38\n\nThen they heard there was someone further along the road. “Maybe it is our good old friend Gandalf coming back to help us?” Gimli shouted. But no, it wasn’t him, instead they found a Gondorian Spearman and a Snowbourn Scout locked in mortal combat with the Spawn. Before they could reach the lost soldiers the Gondorian was killed and eaten by the spider. Everyone ganged up and hacked the spider to small pieces!\n\n“We made it! We won!” said Gimli.\n\n“No, we have just finished the first leg of three of our travel to Lorien. I wonder what challenges the next leg of our journey has in mind for us?” said Aragon gloomy.\n\n“I shouldn’t worry, what could be worse than Ungoliant’s Spawn?” Eowyn asked rhetorically.\n\nPTM1.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM1.jpg.954a9135fb66a2583f287d626908cf8e.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM1.jpg.954a9135fb66a2583f287d626908cf8e.jpg]\n\nPTM2.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM2.jpg.56bb76a21abb5c03a23ec80efa5a5708.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM2.jpg.56bb76a21abb5c03a23ec80efa5a5708.jpg]\n\nPTM3.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM3.jpg.83dc15c67cdc3191b30888c5760b872a.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM3.jpg.83dc15c67cdc3191b30888c5760b872a.jpg]\n\nPTM4.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM4.jpg.5bd2033b93662c520b20969e0f7901bd.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM4.jpg.5bd2033b93662c520b20969e0f7901bd.jpg]\n\nPTM5.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM5.jpg.1bc8868e0422bd5eebb80889d5d3c24d.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM5.jpg.1bc8868e0422bd5eebb80889d5d3c24d.jpg]\n\nPTM6.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM6.jpg.075dd3dbacb6d7a0f857a38a015687b1.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM6.jpg.075dd3dbacb6d7a0f857a38a015687b1.jpg]\n\nPTM7.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM7.jpg.3be6a1d51b1d7c88954880d23c96630e.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_11/PTM7.jpg.3be6a1d51b1d7c88954880d23c96630e.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285604-new-player-playing-first-scenario-a-write-up/?do=findComment&comment=3524491","commentId":3524491,"userName":"Gandalf_","timestamp":1541428816,"content":"Welcome to the game and community!

Once you declare and exhaust a defender, the attack must go through (although you can cancel the shadow effect, or damage from the attack with some cards). You would need to play Feint earlier in the combat phase, which would prevent the Spawn from attacking at all.\n\n> On 11/3/2018 at 3:56 PM, BjörnF said:\n> \n> “We are safe behind the Thicket Of Spears” Eowyn said confidently.\n\nWith the heroes you were using, you cannot play Thicket of Spears. It must be payed for by three different heroes and Gimli is your only hero that can pay for cards from the Tactics sphere.\n\nOther than that, well done. Stay with this game.
