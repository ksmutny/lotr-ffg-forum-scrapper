This month we'll be playing three quests from The Wilds of Rhovanion box and the Ered Mithrin cycle. The quests are:\n\n1) Journey Up the Anduin\n2) Fire in the Night\n3) The Fate of Wilderland\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n1) Each player will construct a 50+ card deck, then use that exact deck against all three quests. You may use that deck freely against any quests (include the three quests in the league) prior to the run for testing purposes, but you may not use any trial runs for your official results.\n\n2) At least one of the heroes must be from a box with those quests. This means that you must have at least one of Brand Son Bain, Bard Son of Brand, Thranduil, Radagast.\n\n3) Your score against each quest will be how much help you need to defeat it, based on the Grace of the Valar variant invented by Seastan. It works like this:\n\nFor each token you have, you can choose to draw a card or give a hero a resource. This happens one at a time, so if I use my first token to draw a card, I see the card before I decide whether to use my second token for a card or a resource. This can be done *anytime* during setup.\n\nThe original variant starts at zero tokens and gains two tokens if you lose quickly (first five turns) and one if you do not -- however, for the purposes of this league I will allow you to start a quest at any number of tokens, and adjust by as many as you want. The only rules for adding/reducing tokens are these:\n\nRule 1) If you lose a quest with X tokens, you cannot play that quest again with X or less tokens.\nRule 2) If you defeat a quest with Y tokens, you cannot play that quest again with Y or more tokens.\n\nSo for example, if I start with six tokens against Into the Pit and defeat it, I can play it again with 0-5 tokens. If I then try with three tokens and lose, I can play it again with 4 or 5 tokens. If I try with four and lose, I can play it again with 5 tokens. If I win, my final score for that quest is 5, and if I lose my final score for the quest is 6. (Alternatively, I could've decided that 6 was a good enough score the first time I played it, and just have my final score be 6 without playing again.)\n\nRemember that tokens do not carry over between quests. When playing Foundations of Stone it does not matter how many tokens I needed to defeat Road to Rivendell.\n\n4) You are not required to publish your deck, but providing a ringsdb link is encouraged (otherwise I may need to ask you for your decklist at the end of the month if required for a tiebreaker). You are required to reveal which Heroes you used, and how many cards in your deck came from outside The Lost Realm/Angmar Awakened, SoH/Haradrim and a single core. Do not include outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck itself.\n\nNote: Contracts (from the most recent cycle) are not part of the deck and should not be counted. A Loot Deck (from the Burglar's turn contract) is also not part of the deck and should not be counted. The One Ring or the Messenger of the King ally/hero should also not be counted *unless* your deck uses those cards to reach 50 -- the Master card fetched by the One Ring should be counted. You may follow contract/One Ring setup instructions at the same as hero setup, ignoring Caleb's ruling.\n\n5) Tiebreakers have frequently mattered in this league. Here are the tiebreakers, in order:\n---\n1st) The number of outside cards (i.e. not from The Wilds of Rhovanion/Ered Mithrin, Shadows of Mirkwood or a single core) used in the deck. Do not count outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck. Less cards is better.\n\n2nd) The number of heroes specifically from The Wilds of Rhovanion/Ered Mithrin and Shadows of Mirkwood. More is better.\n\n3rd) The number of heroes used from this list: Brand Son Bain, Bard Son of Brand, Thranduil, Radagast. More is better.\n\n4th) The number of cards in the deck outside The Wilds of Rhovanion/Ered Mithrin and Shadows of Mirkwood. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n5th) The number of cards outside Journey Up the Anduin, Fire in the Night, and The Fate of Wilderland. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n6th) Performance in October's Solo League (if you didn't play or finish September's League, a median performance will be assumed). Whoever did worst wins this tiebreaker.\n---\n\n6) 1st place gets to choose the cycle for January's league, 2nd place gets to choose a quest from that cycle, and 3rd place gets to choose a quest *not* to be used from that cycle. In an effort to expand the diversity of decks used, the last place player will choose an additional cycle that may be used for deckbuilding in January's league.\n\n7) Weekly deadlines will at 11:59pm Eastern on the 14th, 21st, and 28th. Only the final deadline really matters for scoring and cannot be extended -- the first two deadlines are only to be included in intermediate standings.\n\nJourney Up the Anduin: November 14th\nFire in the Night: November 21st\nThe Fate of Wilderland: November 28th\n\n8 ) I've created a google spreadsheet for results here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iZeehdX7jYtDpUmzpsY1TWAY_SGhR8XN6wugqogInx0/edit#gid=0 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iZeehdX7jYtDpUmzpsY1TWAY_SGhR8XN6wugqogInx0/edit#gid=0]\n\nTo join the league, merely add your name and information about your deck to the spreadsheet, then enter your results as you have them. Please give a link to your deck if you built or published it on ringsdb, but it is not required.\n\nIf you wish you may run additional decks against the quests and record your results, but only the first entry will be considered for the competition itself.\n\nEdited November 2 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312272-solo-league-27-wilds-of-rhovanionered-mithrin-with-shadows-of-mirkwood-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=4009392","commentId":4009392,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1604299992,"content":"Thanks for posting this up!
