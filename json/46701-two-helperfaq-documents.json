If the 'after it attacks' actually happens literally immediately after it attacks, then, erm... Wargs declare as attackers and then run back to staging area.  Not right.   So, in this case \"after\" must mean after the attack has resolved.\n\nI'm going to play the chieftan the same way for now.   The big discussion about the beastmaster who gets an additional card \"after it attacks\" - I'm pretty sure this is incorrect and the card should say \"when\".\n\nCant wait for the official FAQ - until then, we'll just make it up and argue about it! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46701-two-helperfaq-documents/?do=findComment&comment=467753","commentId":467753,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1305257297,"content":"HyenaSpotz said:\n\n Great work!

So, to use his powers, nobody else can attack at all in this turn.\n\nAs you wrote your explanation, it seems that you can have Dunhere attack creatures in the staging area with a +1 while others attack engaged creatures (i,e, as the \"only\" meant 'the only one attacking creatures in that staging area\")  \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46701-two-helperfaq-documents/?do=findComment&comment=467902","commentId":467902,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1305277333,"content":"Each attack is a separate occurence anyway.

Yes, the German makes it pretty clear that you don't add the resource marker until after Ufthak has resolved his first attack, and you give the Beastmaster the second Shadow card before resolving its attack. This is the most intuitive way to make sense of the two cards, and indeed the way I suspect most of us have been playing with them."}]}
