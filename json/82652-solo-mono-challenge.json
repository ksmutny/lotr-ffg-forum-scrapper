And, of course, some fun! Additionally, players who have troubles builfing mono sphere decks may get some inspiration. In this Solo Mono Challenge solo players try to beat the \"Peril in Pelargir\" scenario from the HoN expansion with a mono sphere deck from each of the four spheres.\n\nHere are the rules that you have to follow to participate in the challenge:\n\n \n\n1) Players choose a sphere and they build a mono deck for that sphere. Then they get three attempts to beat the scenario. For each victory the players get 3 points. For each victory with a secrecy deck (2 heroes) the players get five points. For each loss the players get minus 1 point. For each dead hero during a victorious game the players get minus 1 point.\n\n \n\n2) Killing the \"Umbar Assassin\" is worth one bonus point (only once per game).\n\n \n\n3) During round 1only (!) the players treat the card text of \"The Leaping Fish\" as if it was empty.\n\n \n\n4) Heroes and decks may be changed each game. Decks may include neutral cards, but no cards from any of the other spheres.\n\n \n\n5) After the players have done this for each of the four spheres, they tally their points and post their results together with the heroes they used in this thread. The player with the most points is the winner of the first Solo Mono Trophy. In case of a tie the player with the lowest starting threat of a victorious leadership deck wins.\n\n \n\n6) All cards that have been published by FFG may be used for this challenge.\n\n \n\n7) The challenge ends on May 1st at 8 pm CET. Each player has only one attempt to play this challenge.\n\n \n\n \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n \n\nResults:\n\n \n\n1) Illeimoen - 16 points\n\n2) Pharmboys2013 - 15 points\n\n3) leptokurt - 10 points\n\n4) You! Yes, YOU!\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82652-solo-mono-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=786994","commentId":786994,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1366448448,"content":"Sounds fun. *starts to think of decks*"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82652-solo-mono-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=787006","commentId":787006,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1366450325,"content":"Why take the bite out of The Leaping Fish?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82652-solo-mono-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=787010","commentId":787010,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1366451445,"content":"Funny, I just built four mono-sphere decks last night.

I guess I could have meddle with the deck a bit more to give it more willpower but I felt it was going much against the strength of the deck. The first game with Tactics, I completed the first two stages in three rounds, and unscathed (killing the Thug with Hands Upon the Bow on round 1 to finish off the Leaping Fish after revealing Local Trouble). Still I ran out of threat in the end, mostly due to Local Trouble. At least I managed to get rid of the assassin twice in the other games.\n\nLeadership was as good as espected there but it is due two things: battle-oriented quest and lack of terrible when revealed effects. By the stage three, willpower was no longer a problem. I think it could have won all three games with a favourable draw.\n\nLore, on the other hand, was a bit lucky to get two victories, I feel. I want better hero line-up for that deck. And the sphere, like Tactics, is meant to cooperate with other spheres, or decks. Denethor is great solo but without readying effects, his powers are very limited.\n\nSpirit did as expected, even in battle, they're good enough to stand a chance; were it a quest outside of Heirs of Númenor, the sphere's superiority would have been more pronounced.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82652-solo-mono-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=787493","commentId":787493,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1366598397,"content":"I agree with you Pharmboys on the Leadership Gondor deck, with the new Gondor cards coming, it could be great.

I will post the decks later if anyone is interested. The Tactics had almost all the Eagles and Bofur for the willpower in the end.
