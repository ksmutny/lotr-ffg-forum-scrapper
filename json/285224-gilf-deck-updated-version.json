I absolutely love the Galadriel hero. I use her so much that when I'm not using her I sometimes forget to move my threat up. She's so good in fact that she works well in this two hero deck I made (Grandmother and granddaughter).  It's not optimized at all. I wanted to try to utilize cards with Galadriel art on them as much as possible, so I went with a little bit of a victory display theme. Even still I've defeated quite a few nightmare decks with this deck. I hope you guys like it. \n\n \n\nhttps://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/10224/the-g-i-l-f-deck-2.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/10224/the-g-i-l-f-deck-2.0]\n\nEdited October 27, 2018 by zeromage"}]}
