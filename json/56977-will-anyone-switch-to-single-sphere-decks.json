I pretty much play a quest six times (four decks paired once with each other equals six plays) then on to the next quest. Only really played Mirkwood more times, Anduin and Carrock once with a friend for seven plays. After six plays, especially if I have winning record, I see very little to no reason to go back, I've \"beaten\" the quest. Even worse, if I go 3-0 to begin with, I tend to have a hard time getting motivated to play to my best ability and try and beat the quest three more times. Doesn't just apply to LotR, when we play snooker with my friend, we play 4 frames. If I win the first two, motivation and focus tends to go away, I've secured a draw at worse, won't lose, so don't have to play at my best anymore.\n\nAlso, I prefer to spend my time devoted to LotR to play instead of \"wasting\" it on deckbuilding. Pre-built decks, with little tweaking, I can break them out and play in about, allowing me to use 99% of the time to actual playing, thus leaving that extra time for other games since it isn't wasted constantly blowing up working decks and starting a new build from scratch.\n\nIf I want to play deckbuilding, I take out Thunderstone. In none of the LCGs I own (W:I, LotR and CoC) do I bother with any real deckbuilding.

Tweak here and there as new cards are added, but no overhauls. As for getting bored, one of the reasons LotR really has a max two plays per day is that after those two plays, all four decks have seen action and I can't be bothered to see the same deck twice in a day (which effectively eliminates me from any and all tournament play). However, that is still 1000x less hassle than: play, blow up, build a new deck, test, play, blow up, build, test, play just to get more plays.\n\nI currently have 36 decks for WWE Raw Deal which is closing in on 3000 plays since August 2008 (will pass 3000 before 2012). Should I be blowing up all those decks day after day as well? Taking out and separating, unsleeving, resleeving 36x60 = 2160 cards constantly? I don't think so. It would take several days to take apart the decks and then rebuild them, not to mention several months to see all the decks paired against one another to see that they are balanced to a point where we can just randomly pick two decks and pit them against each other.\n\nbooored said:\n\nWhat is really wired to me is that there is now an entire sub genre of card games that has evolved in the last 5 years or so that completely eliminate the deck construction aspect from the game.

Only really missing a couple of games and then I've so far gathered all the games I care for. See for me theme is the #1 requirement/priority. If the theme doesn't click for me (or there is hardly/no theme at all, looking at eurogames), doesn't matter what it brings to the table in terms of mechanics, innovation, etc., it simply won't get played. Period.\n\nI play LCGs for their theme and no random booster approach. Knowing what I get in each and every pack fixed allows me to choose if a want a pack or not. For LotR the packs have been more must-buy than for W:I or CoC since the quests are what for me are the most important aspect of the game. Deckbuilding doesn't even get on the chart as far as importance is concerned. One of the reasons I took the basic structure for the decks from a thread on BGG was that I didn't have to bother mulling over what combos of heroes and spheres to use, I could just take the decks proposed and tweak them here and there as I desired.

I almost always play single sphere with 3 or 4 players and frequently with 2 player games.

Also, as Bohemond said, it really helps economically to have three resources right away. I play single sphere less frequently solo, usually dual sphere.

Let's say I am (as an example) building a 2 sphere hero and 1 leadership hero deck. I can't have too many Leadership cards otherwise they'll sit in my hand and I'm not drawing enough of the cards I need/want. If I have too few then I'm not getting the cards and I am gaining resources that won't get spent. If my single Leadership hero dies or leaves play for any reason then roughly a third of my deck becomes dead weight.

Rather than just put int it all the cards you like. Evaluating cards on their synergy with other cards is one of the harder concepts in these card games. It is a lot easier to just look at a card and evaluate it on its face value. Like \"Westfold Horse-Breaker\", not really joyish in a solo spirit deck, but in a spirit/leadership running the Prince, that card becomes a amazing winner.\n\n\nRemember this is early days, soon, and not that far away either. You will have to deck build to make a solo-sphere deck, as even in a single sphere there will be many many many more cards than you can place in a single deck.\n\nYou see I am almost the exact opposite of you. IMO, solo sphere decks are extremely weak in comparison to multi-sphere. Especially for solo play, there is defiantly a place for single sphere decks in 3+ players. I mean I can not even understand how a single sphere tactics deck is able to play mirkwood, what do you do when you come to Journey? But a Lore, Tactics owns that quest. A Lore, Tactics, Spirit with a leadership splash can beat every quest in the entire cycle.\n\nI mean each to their own, have fun is the point, but even if you \"hate\" deck building... eventually you will have to as the card pool will just get bigger and bigger.\n\nBohemond said:\n\nMany of the scenarios are front loaded. You face an immediate challenge out of tha gates, and often need to resolve that challenge during the first few turns. Single Sphere decks have a lot more flexibility in terms of early turn drops.\n\nThis is an extremely good point. Recently I got a regularly 3 player game running once a week and we have found having a single player running a mono-sphere deck allows you greater flexibility in that very first ally drop."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56977-will-anyone-switch-to-single-sphere-decks/?do=findComment&comment=564250","commentId":564250,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1323108086,"content":"A pure Tactics deck doesn't work at all solo.

said:\n\nI think there is another reason to play single sphere decks that we haven';t touched on (and I say this as someone who plays primarily dual sphere decks).\n\nMany of the scenarios are front loaded.  You face an immediate challenge out of tha gates, and often need to resolve that challenge during the first few turns.  Single Sphere decks have a lot more flexibility in terms of early turn drops.  They can play a 3 cost card on turn 1 or a 5 cost card on turn 2 (I am looking at you Gildor).  Once you make it to the mid game, I find dual sphere decks out perform their single sphere counterparts because of added versatility and card power, but the trick is getting to that stage of the game.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with regard to solo play only:\n\nThis is perhaps the only reason I can see a mono-sphere deck being viable -- if you can get the \"jump\" on the encounter deck or get over the initial challenge, the rest of the game becomes much more manageable when you're not playing catch-up (i.e. you don't get location locked, you have freedom to choose when to play cards and when to wait).  As Bohemond has pointed out, this is much easier to accomplish using powerful, expensive cards on turn two.  I've noticed that you can emulate this strong early game play by using heroes that are powerful individually (but generate more starting threat) or that are able to function well together without being dependent on drawing certain cards in your starting hand.  As an example of this, I run Eowyn, Boromir, and Glorfindel in one of my decks, which incurs what to me is a high starting threat of 32, but gives me an extremely strong starting base -- I can fight, quest, defend, heal, etc., depending on the need.  \n\nThat being said, I personally play with all duo or tri-sphere decks, as I feel like it gives me more room for creativity.  A lot of cross sphere cards synergize well with each other, and allow you to cover the weaknesses of one sphere or the other.  I feel as though the spheres are intentionally designed to excel in certain areas to encourage players to explore different deck combinations, and while future player cards may increase the versatility of each sphere on its own, as it stands now I feel as if it's impossible to play a mono-sphere deck as successfully in solo play as a mixed deck without forcing yourself to use certain cards.  Of course, mixing also limits you in ways --  for instance, I generally don't normally don't include cards of (colored) cost five or higher unless I run at least two heroes from that sphere or unless it is critical to that deck.  Although, that principle is more related to my personal preference for reliability -- in multi-sphere decks I feel as if cards of cost four or more are usable and optimal in fewer situations, particularly so for cards that aren't for your main sphere if you're running a two-color deck.  \n\nBut I think what is currently holding back deck design is a lack of resource generating cards.  With basically only SoG as a reliable source of additional resources, I feel as if FFG has played it safe so far.  Since drawing cards has already been revealed to be a game breaking mechanic, I guess they have to keep resource generation in check, but I think they should try to explore better ways of obtaining resources other than \"move all your resources from one hero to the other\" or \"gain a resource when an ally goes out of play or takes damage.\"  \n\nAnyway, I'm rambling on here, but the only reasons right now that I would play a monosphere deck is for fun, for thematic reasons, or for multiplayer games.\n\n "}]}
