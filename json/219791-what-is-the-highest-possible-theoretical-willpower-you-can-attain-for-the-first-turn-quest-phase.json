Now your threat is 40, and you can proceed as before.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Arwen has +1 base willpower, plus she benefits from Lords of the Eldar for another +6, so your new total is:\n> \n> Arwen (3+6), Thorin (3), Cirdan (4+37+6), Emery (1) = 60\n> \n>  \n> \n> Bonus points if someone can figure out how to use Elven-Light to squeeze some more willpower out of this setup, or get another 2 Doomed so we can swap Thorin for Elrohir.\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n\n \n\nBrilliant addition with Seeing Stone!\n\n \n\n \n\n> I haven't done the math, but you sort of need to make sure that your deck doesn't ever end up not being divisible by 3.  Otherwise, you get to a point where you need to discard the top 3 cards of your deck and if only one is left and it is Spirit or Neutral, Emery stays in play.  Alternatively, if you legally can't discard the bottom cards of your deck if it is not equal to three, then there is a chance that your Hidden Caches will be inaccessible, reducing the amount of willpower attained.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Sure, your starting deck can be divisible by 3, by choice, but once you start adding in things like Rallying Cry, Legacy of Numenor, then reshuffling with Will of the West, the amount of cards in your deck will be altered.  So that means if we play one card, we need to play 2 more.  Or if we play 2 cards, we need to play 1 more.\n\n \n\nWell, just use the appropriate number of cards to make sure it's divisible by 3 on the last time through your deck so that the Emery/Lords combo works. The odds of hidden cache being in the bottom 1 or 2 of your deck in the previous times through your 1000+ card deck are pretty negligible I's say."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219791-what-is-the-highest-possible-theoretical-willpower-you-can-attain-for-the-first-turn-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=2216437","commentId":2216437,"userName":"zeromage","timestamp":1463167614,"content":"Sorry I don't have time to read the whole thread atm but did anyone try grappling hook shenanigans with gondorian fire?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219791-what-is-the-highest-possible-theoretical-willpower-you-can-attain-for-the-first-turn-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=2216479","commentId":2216479,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1463169112,"content":"> Sorry I don't have time to read the whole thread atm but did anyone try grappling hook shenanigans with gondorian fire?\n\n \n\nDelay the enemy is basically the same thing and it's cheaper.
