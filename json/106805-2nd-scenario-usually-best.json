The question is though: why is the third quest not better than the second? In the core set the reason seems to be that the third quest was almost unbeatable solo and in multiplayer a tough nut with only the cards available in the core set. The other expansions didn't have that problem, but it appears to me that the designers tried to put too many things in these final quests to make them outstanding. Not that these were bad ideas, but IMO the third quests are most of the time too complicated which is why they're often versatile - either too hard or too easy. Sometimes they include badass enemies, and if you don't draw them at all it's a walk in the park. If you draw them too early, you're toast. Second quests seem to me more straightforward and thus easier to balance."}]}
