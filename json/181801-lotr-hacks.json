This is especially important in multiplayer games where the staging area can become really hairy. The hack is pretty simple and doesn't require any new components. Simply as you are committing characters to the quest, place progress tokens on them similar to resource tokens equal to their will power. If you have any cards that boost willpower eg eowyn, Faramir take into account their boosted will. Then during the quest resolution stage spend your progress tokens, first on cards in the staging area accounting for their full threat (with any buffs) then spend on the active location and any left over go on the quest. Doing this will stop you from constantly adding and readding everyones will power. It is really so easy and makes the quest stage so much cleaner.\n\n\n \n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181801-lotr-hacks/?do=findComment&comment=1680850","commentId":1680850,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1435996382,"content":"I don't think that placing 20~ progress tokens on 10~ cards and then removing it from them after staging area is revealed is easier than just counting player willpower once, and then subtracting staging threat from it  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181801-lotr-hacks/?do=findComment&comment=1680888","commentId":1680888,"userName":"JTG81","timestamp":1436008314,"content":"> I don't think that placing 20~ progress tokens on 10~ cards and then removing it from them after staging area is revealed is easier than just counting player willpower once, and then subtracting staging threat from it  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\nObviously I'm not trying to convert everyone over to playing it this way. For me and my gaming partner though, this is the way we will be playing from now on as we found it a much more enjoyable experience, and much less mentally fatiguing which is not a great quality for a game.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181801-lotr-hacks/?do=findComment&comment=1680899","commentId":1680899,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1436010311,"content":"I'm with John on this.

If you end up doing it more than once than to me that is fiddly and there are many circumstances where as a 3 or 4 player group we are adding and subtracting will power more than once. All I can say is if you are interested try it out and see how you like it but I recognize it may not be for everyone. At least though, try it out before completely writing it off especially in large multiplayer games."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181801-lotr-hacks/?do=findComment&comment=1680928","commentId":1680928,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1436013933,"content":"I like the idea. I was thinking that it might be easier to just make a pule of tokens equal to you WP and then take tokens out of the pile based on the threat in the staging area, but this would be more difficult to keep track of if a treachery removes characters from the quest or something.

Honestly there has been a lot of great tips on how to make the questing stage easier be it with tokens, dice or the threat tracker.

I also play more two-handed than anything so maybe it's a better alternative for me as opposed to 3-4 player games. I take a Red D20 and a Blue D20 both from Magic the Gathering (so the numbers spin down as opposed to being random) and use them to represent the threat and the willpower of both sides. I suppose with more people you can just throw a couple of D6's in the mix if the numbers go higher than 20 but for me they rarely do so."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181801-lotr-hacks/?do=findComment&comment=1684012","commentId":1684012,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1436275266,"content":"I've gone over 20 several times in two-handed play so if I was going to use dice I would prefer 2 D10 or a threat counter.

Seems like a fine method."}]}
