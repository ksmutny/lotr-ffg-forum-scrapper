Some allies also offer a unique discard effect (Westfold Horse-Breaker, The Riddermark's Finest, etc.).\n\n \n\nCan these be triggered simultaniously? For example, can I discard The Riddermark's Finest to place 2 progress tokens on a location, and then instantly play Ride to Ruin? Or do I need to choose between one of the two?\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242460-multiple-discard-effectsactions/?do=findComment&comment=2638198","commentId":2638198,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1487002169,"content":"You have to choose between the two.
