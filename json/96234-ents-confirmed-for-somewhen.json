Although, John Howe did provide artwork on several of the older Lord of the Rings games such as the circa-2000 board game and LotR: The Confrontation (one of my all-time favorite board games.)  I also think he provided artwork for a LotR card game that ran in the mid-1990's, but I can't remember for sure.\n\n \n\nSo perhaps it isn't a matter of price, but interest.  However, FFG does already have very talented artists that are doing a fantastic job, so no complaints from me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=945899","commentId":945899,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1388921740,"content":"Very excited about Ents, but I can't get the link to work!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=946029","commentId":946029,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1388936583,"content":"> Very excited about Ents, but I can't get the link to work!\n\n \n\nI am now having the same problem.  I would suspect that the artist (accidentally) violated some sort of agreement with FFG.  I'm sure they asked the artist to take the image off the site. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=946033","commentId":946033,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1388936805,"content":"It's gone now.

Certainly FFG has a bigger budget than Cubicle7.

So that it would be a deck that if you lose one hero, you lose the game. That'd be great and would open many posibilities.\n\n \n\nBut actually, now that I think of it, I'd rather have this for the Wizards. So many people have been wondering how to make Wizard heroes, well, that'd be my answer.

Perhaps I was being too pernickety. I shall illustrate them again some day, in my own time, and do proper justice to them. I try to illustrate anything from Middle-Earth with proper research and care. Unfortunately short deadlines, can sometimes interfere with the style and success of the result (as far as the artist is concerned). But that's the way it goes sometimes!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=1055726","commentId":1055726,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1398014904,"content":"What's your favorite pierce of art work you've done for this card game?

As I mentioned in an earlier post, I really like Leaflock, I feel I managed to capture Tolkien in the way that I imagine it in my head i.e a sense of age, mythology and romantic legend. I also like Goblin Taskmaster, as I had fun designing what I think Goblins should look like. The head is actually based on a cat's skull. I later developed the idea with Eagle Hunter and tried adding bone piercings and dreadlocks as well as armour.\n\n \n\nI also really like how The One Ring and the Arkenstone worked out. I choose simplicity for those designs. I felt the Arkenstone looked particularly effective once it was placed on the card with it's gold frame, that was a nice surprise! Finally, Smaug's eye turned out well, it was quite a quick card to paint actually, and I felt the mood and texture I managed to capture felt right.\n\n \n\nAll the cards I mentioned are on my website.\n\n \n\nThere are a few other cards due out soon that I had fun with too, but I can't talk about those!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=1057013","commentId":1057013,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1398116846,"content":"It's awesome to have you on here Mike Nash!!

I enjoy taking a look through the rulebooks and cards, checking out the artwork created by all the different artists! Pleasure aside, I'm also checking that my art still suits the product as a whole and is doing it justice. With that knowledge, I then move on to painting the next batch of cards!\n\nEdited April 22, 2014 by Mike Nash"}]}
