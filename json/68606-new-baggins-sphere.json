If you look at it the mirkwood and darrowdelf cycles also have their own themed cards which we don´t see outside those cycles. It might be more obvious in TH with Bilbo sphere and treasures having an obvious impact on those scenarios, but I think that´s just a natural development. Next cycle there might not be such an obvious addition and future cycles after that might have addition at least as obvious.\n\nI´m gonna stop now before this develops into a rant cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68606-new-baggins-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=669402","commentId":669402,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1344255211,"content":" I hope i'm wrong, but from what little has been posted so far about the Hobbit box, it appears to be that the baggins sphere will be quest specific and that those cards would have no role if playing a quest from the shadows or mirkwood or darrowdelf cycle"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68606-new-baggins-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=669496","commentId":669496,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1344262289,"content":"Pharmboys2013 said:\n\n I hope i'm wrong, but from what little has been posted so far about the Hobbit box, it appears to be that the baggins sphere will be quest specific and that those cards would have no role if playing a quest from the shadows or mirkwood or darrowdelf cycle\n\n\n\nI don't think you are wrong I'm afraid. From the news review 18th of April it's stated \"Players can use any of their other The Lord of the Rings cards while playing through the scenarios from The Hobbit, and most of the expansion's cards can be used in any other deck, for any scenario, but The Hobbit also introduces five unique cards specifically designed for the expansion’s scenarios. These include Bilbo Baggins [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-hobbit/over-hill-and-under-hill/bilbo-baggins-the-hobbit.png] (The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill, 1), an event with the Baggins sphere of influence, and the new treasure cards. These cards are only intended for use in The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill and a second Saga Expansion, slated to arrive in late 2012, that will relate the second and final half of Bilbo’s adventures.\n\nHm, to me it looks like its only 5 cards that can't be used outside the TH expansions. But either the Baggins sphere only contains 1 card or somethings strange here. Or? I mean, you get a Baggins sphere hero = Bilbo Baggins, but he's one of the cards that can't be used outside TH. So if there's more Baggins sphere cards, you can't really play them since he's the only hero from that sphere. But then I'd say it's a pretty lousy sphere of 1 card preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif] The treasure cards, which I interpret count 3, are encounter cards, or sort of, since they have encounter card logos.\n\nOuch!
