Ended up with hopefully a pretty decent Eagles deck, and a promising Rohan deck. Then, just to check them, I played 2p a couple of times the introductory scenario and this situation arose:\n\n \n\n- Eagles of the Misty Mountains had 2 eagles as attachment, hence its attack was 4, and the defense was 4\n\n- Legolas has Support of the Eagles attached, and I wanted him to gain the defense bonus of Eagles of the Misty Mountains\n\n \n\nshould he gain +2 Defense (unmodified Eagles) or +4 (modified stats due to the two attachments)?\n\n \n\nMany thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124251-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains-support-of-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=1290019","commentId":1290019,"userName":"wlk","timestamp":1412622220,"content":"+4\n\nEagles of the Misty Mountains's effect is passive, so permanent.\n\nEdited October 6, 2014 by wlk"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124251-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains-support-of-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=1290028","commentId":1290028,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1412622483,"content":"Yup, if it was the printed value, it would use the word \"printed\" on the card.  As it does not, you get the current value of the Eagle's defense."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124251-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains-support-of-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=1290032","commentId":1290032,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1412622736,"content":"That's SO lovely!

I never considered giving the same hero more than one Support of the Eagles, but you're right, there's nothing against it. Still, call me dumb, but I'd not give two or three of them to the very same hero. It sounds so wrong to me.\n\n \n\nAs for the deck...
