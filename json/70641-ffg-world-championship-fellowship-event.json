What is this? I dont think is a real tournament but look like some organize program for play some kind of event. Maybe is a first step to tournament system? I heard they will issue some game kit where will be some encounter cards to make previous quest more interesting and hard. Look like is kind of program for play in the store. Not like a tournament, just kind of fun like Decipher Lotr LCG Race to mount doom pack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70641-ffg-world-championship-fellowship-event/?do=findComment&comment=690833","commentId":690833,"userName":"Carnage4u","timestamp":1347267495,"content":"This game is very enjoyable, but part of the appeal is the \"co-op\" I dont understand why there needs to be a \"championship\" for a game that is built around being co-op."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70641-ffg-world-championship-fellowship-event/?do=findComment&comment=692543","commentId":692543,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1347488918,"content":"I don't think this will be any sort of a competitive \"championship.\" In all likelihood, it'll just be a sanctioned social gaming session.

In fact, the market is flooded with them. The greatest strength of this game is the fact it is co-op. I hope this event is something fun that a gaming group/pair/individual can attend, have a great time playing together against the encounter deck, and maybe take home a promo card.\n\nRPG companies like \"Wizards of the Coast\" or \"Paizo\" run game nights all the time where people can show up and have an adventure with D&D or Pathfinder. Everyone has fun in a non-competitive, co-operative event. I hope FFG takes a page from the RPG scene and runs the LoTR:LCG events the same way."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70641-ffg-world-championship-fellowship-event/?do=findComment&comment=722688","commentId":722688,"userName":"Mika Mika","timestamp":1352800628,"content":"  Hello there,\n\nI must admit that the perspective of a mysterious Lord of the Rings Event was rather exciting.\nHowever It seems that it has been canceled.\nIs it the truth ?\n\nMay we have a closer insight into what it should have been ?\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nEDIT : I also posted the same question on  the World Championship thread.
