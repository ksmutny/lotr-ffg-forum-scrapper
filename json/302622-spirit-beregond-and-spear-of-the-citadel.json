It would be different if Beregond's text box said \"After Beregond exhausts to defend an attack...\" or \"After Beregond is declared as a defender...\" but instead it says \"After Beregond defends an attack...\"\n\nThus, the attack must be completed in order to trigger the ability. The spear interrupts the attack. \n\nIf you refer to Seastan's guide to action windows (https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/10407/a-guide-to-action-windows-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/10407/a-guide-to-action-windows-1.0]) Spear of the citadel would trigger at 6.4.1 while Beregond's ability would trigger at 6.4.4."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302622-spirit-beregond-and-spear-of-the-citadel/?do=findComment&comment=3835770","commentId":3835770,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1574550050,"content":"It feels more intuitive to me for the attack to be considered resolved even if it is aborted for whatever reason at some point during the process.

If no, end the attack.\" What does this mean for card effects that trigger \"after [a character] defends\"? e.g., Spirit Beregond has a Spear of the Citadel, and he is declared as a defender against an enemy attack. The Spear kills the enemy. Can Beregond lower my threat by 1? Similarly for any hero that has a Spear and Armored Destrier attached.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> An attack was initiated, and Beregond was declared a defender, so Beregond has defended an attack regardless of whether or not all the steps of that attack were fully resolved. That means you would still be able to resolve his Response effect.\n> \n> Cheers,\n> \n> Caleb\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302622-spirit-beregond-and-spear-of-the-citadel/?do=findComment&comment=3850352","commentId":3850352,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1576544663,"content":"Huh. I never would've guessed that would be ruled that way.\n\nWhile I'm here though, I will point out that Spear of the Citadel has to attach to a Tactics character and can therefore only attach to Spirit Beregond if you first give him a Song of Battle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302622-spirit-beregond-and-spear-of-the-citadel/?do=findComment&comment=3850986","commentId":3850986,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1576623046,"content":"I was wondering when someone was gonna point that out... "}]}
