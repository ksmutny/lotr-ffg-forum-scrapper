How boring! Targon and Iorlas too obscure/peaceful? Both were men of Gondor, probably soldiers, if we get Dúnhere in the very first release of the game and now that we just got Ingold I don't see any reason not to see Targon or Iorlas. Surely they're not the designer's most urgent characters to make, but just coming out and plainly saying they shouldn't be done... I just disagree. And what about Bergil? He was a favorite character of mine in ROTK, he was there in the houses of healing and went to find the Athelas to heal Éowyn and Faramir, not to mention he was brave and lively, which could translate in a high willpower. That just screams \"Spirit ally that fetches attachment\", and that would be awesome. I just can't understand how you say Targon and Bergil are too peaceful to get player cards and then say that Rosie Cotton could get one. And about the Druédain and Bombadil + Goldberry? They greatly helped the main characters in their chapters and yes, they are both reclusive and could be unthematic in most quests but come on! This is an LCG/TCG, we want to see all our favorite characters and factions represented. We can already take the Eagles into Moria and Treebeard to Mordor, it's pretty clear the designers want to make thematic cards but also give the players the choice of whether they consider Bombadil unthematic to bring him along or not. I could understand if they never made cards for these 2 characters, but your statement just seems to be all about restricting the game and closing opportunities for some cool stuff. Don't be such a stick in the mud! \n\nEdited July 22, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182931-unique-characters-left-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=1700576","commentId":1700576,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1437583325,"content":"I agree, I think that they should, and might eventually have to, make player cards for a lot of the people mentioned on the list.  Personally, I think that Ghan-Buri-Ghan will be a hero.  They could start an entire Druedain mechanic, with something like they are hard to get into play but they pay off if you can.  \n\nAlso, they really should make player cards of all the Outlands Captains.  I know that some think that the mechanic is broken, but I don't, and I find it frustrating that we get the Lord of Morthond card and no Duinhir to put it on! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182931-unique-characters-left-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=1700593","commentId":1700593,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1437583911,"content":"Yes, Duinhir!

Don't be such a stick in the mud! \n> \n>  \n\nYeah sorry I still very strongly disagree. I actually think that the designers just making a card for every single character that is mentioned by name (no matter how small a part or unimportant they are) is really stupid. Three different allies for each of Farmer Maggots dogs? Robin Smallburrow? Goldberry? I think people are being far too optimistic and are asking for characters that are so extremely minor in the story it would make little sense to get cards for them. Yes we can take Ents and Eagles everywhere but they are iconic and integral races and characters to the stories and lands of middle earth. Yes Tom is iconic too but would NEVER leave his lands (the Ents begrudgingly do so to attack Isengard and the eagles help out several different times in both the Hobbit and LOTR), has nothing to do with the story after his appearance and we already have him as an objective ally in both The Old Forest and Fog on the Barrow Downs. Similarly the Druedain whilst important are an ancient race that have completely isolated themselves and have cut themselves off from the rest of Middle Earth. Hell I'm pretty sure (if I remember correctly) that the Rohirrim even hunt them for sport in the third age. They were once great allies of men but now are just hidden away in their forest avoiding everyone. Yes they help Rohan reach Pelennor Fields in time and hold off orcs pursuing the Rohirrim but do they leave the forest and join the battle? Afterwards what happens? Do they rejoin the rest of Middle Earth now that Sauron is defeated? No Aragorn grants them the forest they live in forbidding anyone else to enter without permission and they eventually apparently fade into history or myth. \n\nI have no intent on restricting the game but think that if FFG have to create cards for every single character that is named it will be really cheesy and wont work. I feel like they are constantly trying to create a very balanced mix of mechanics and theme, and this would totally upset this balance. Instead I would love a few more FFG created characters, far far more non-unique allies for every race, more hero versions of characters we only have ally cards for and vice versa. There are also still all the other named characters we have not seen yet that you listed. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182931-unique-characters-left-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=1701115","commentId":1701115,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1437613380,"content":"I guess we have two different ideas of what this card game should be. To me, this game always had a strong emphasis for being encyclopedic, in that it likes to take the obscure characters and details of the story and expanding upon them. We see that from the Core Set with Gleowine and Dunhere and in the cycles where they expand upon a small mission like capturing Gollum or the gondorian conflicts prior to the war. I think it's safe to say that much of the appeal of the game comes from seeing not only the main Frodo story but also the side stories and places we read very little about. Considering that, it makes absolute sense for me to see every character I listed as a player card, either ally or hero. It just fits with the whole concept behind the game IMO. I mean, even the two previous Lotr card games missed just a few of these. I get your point though, I would also doubt they will make cards for Maggot's dogs or stuff like a Farmer Maggot hero or the developing of the Woodmen trait in the life of this game, but then again ally cards for Bergil or Iorlas are totally possible to me. The thing is, this game already has characters as obscure as the ones I listed, and even an Erestor hero would be stretching it IMO. Characters like Bombadil and Goldberry are less likely as I said, but still possible. And if even the game based on the movies had Bombadil and Goldberry, it'd be rather weird that the game based on the books alone failed to do that. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182931-unique-characters-left-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=1701237","commentId":1701237,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1437625858,"content":"I understand the thematic difficulty with Tom (and Goldberry) but I just want to play them so much, I need to have them as real player cards, haha.
