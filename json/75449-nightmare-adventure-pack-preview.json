I chose to play DG, because I thought with all those cards of the Dwarrowdelf Expansion it wouldn't be as hard as it used to be. Turned out that I still lost 90 percent of my games because most of the decks just didn't work at all. I got frustrated and started to write a longer post that included some FFG bashing and suggestions how this scenario could be made more enjoyable for the majority of the players (I consider myself as a rather good player, so if I get frustrated by DG, how does the average player feel?). However, that post got lost before I could post it (I bet it was Necromancer's Reach or some unknown shadow effect). My rant was that FFG could have implented all these suggestions by giving their customers an updated solo variant of the scenario. And now they finally update the old adventures (which is awesome!), but instead of making DG more accessable, they decided to make it even more frustrating. Surely they must have heard that a vast majority of the players is unhappy about the solo variant of this adventure? And that a lot of players play this game only in solo mode?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75449-nightmare-adventure-pack-preview/?do=findComment&comment=733581","commentId":733581,"userName":"Eric W","timestamp":1355395777,"content":"Sorry, I had to stop reading your blog after the 1st paragraph.  The combination on grey background with black back shading and white letters made my eyes hurt and TBH that's a very rare thing to happen."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75449-nightmare-adventure-pack-preview/?do=findComment&comment=733631","commentId":733631,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1355404545,"content":"Eric W said:\n\nSorry, I had to stop reading your blog after the 1st paragraph.  The combination on grey background with black back shading and white letters made my eyes hurt and TBH that's a very rare thing to happen.\n\n\n\n \n\nThat's a shame, because it was quite entertaining.\n\n \n\nI think it's interesting that some people have no difficulties to read white on black while others are irritated to no end.
