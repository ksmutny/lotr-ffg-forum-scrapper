Sounds like Vilya can avoid doom text of the players dooms cards…..but actually no  it will be a  bit stupid no? Card enter play and doom should to trigger since doom trigger when card come to play (doesn matter play or put) so i think doom will trigger. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103913-vilya-and-doomed-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1051618","commentId":1051618,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1397665708,"content":"Like GrandSpleen said, it's not a cost.

The rules of play defines what a cost is on page 8.\n\n \n\nCost: The number of resources a player must spend\nfrom the appropriate resource pool(s) to play this card\nfrom his hand. Cost is not found on hero cards.\n \nI would say that the word \"resources\" is the keyword there."}]}
