So for now we not really interesting play 3 or more player game.\n\n2 players game start to be more hard and interesting since Carrock come out.\n\nCarrock will not forgive you for mistake as other quest do. If Luis engage you with other trolls can start prepare your coffins.\n\nOf course is depend on the decks as well. All my experience base on 50 cards expert deck 3 copies each card. Sure if you have only 1 core set the game much more harder. But me and my friends buy at least 2 core set each + some singles like U. courage stone, Dwarfen tomb and so  on to get all cards 3 copies.\n\nWe are serious prepare for the tournaments and my goal is win Word cup in the future.\n\nActullay i want say some thanks and respect for some cool players like Bohemond, Pumkins, Radiscul, LightDarker, Dam. I always respect a players who is play deep and think well. So if you have good opponent game also much more interesting.\n\n \n\nEngilsh is not my home lenguage so maybe for someone i can be ridiculous.\n\nActually i think you nick name is also quite ridiculous  Durin3.

You must to build some specific deck to win this one. As i understand you must add some healing cards like Lore of Ilmadris to beat this one. But in other scenario most of the time they will be dead cards in your deck. So for me now the biggest problem how to make deck ti beat all scenario. Before Rhosgobel my beat all deck work very fine but now.......... I start to make new Glorifindel/Eleanor/ Theodred deck. Still in process."}]}
