(you need to be patient to play this game solo…and be winning to lose during the process of getting better at it) also remember that all quests vary in difficulty depending on how many players you have - here are the solo diff ratings that i think:\n\nEasy:\n\nemyn muil\n\ndead marshes\n\nhunt for gollum\n\nthe long dark\n\nMedium:\n\nconflict at the carrock (though gets easier when you figure out the 'win formula'\n\nfoundations of stone\n\nredhorn gate\n\nwatcher in the water\n\nthe first two of the khazad dum quests\n\nthe middle hobbit quest\n\nHard:\n\njourney to rhosgobel\n\nreturn to mirkwood\n\nlast of the khazad dum quests (though can be really easy at times)\n\nroad to rivendell (because of 1 card…sleeping sentry)\n\nthe 1st and 3rd hobbit quests\n\nshadow and flame (though with hama and feint it gets easier)\n\n \n\nrich\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72901-difficulty-ratings/?do=findComment&comment=711162","commentId":711162,"userName":"monk","timestamp":1350493536,"content":" This is great, thanks"}]}
