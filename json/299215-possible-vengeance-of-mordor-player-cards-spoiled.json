seen\nthe cards that will soon set the scene\nbut be aware, those that read on\nFor if you want no spoilers: be gone\nThough cryptic, these messages contain\nA peek into the future of this wonderful game\n\nIn a reflection, two faces I saw\nBoth unique, but features identical\nOne of a higher power, the other not yet achieving its prime\nBut both in play, at the same time\nYet this card between them split their soul\nFor they can never be under the same player's control\n\nIn a dream, I saw the spirit of Gondor returned\nThrough a princess from the sea, who's heart had yearned\nFor her husband across the mountains riding in a sea of green\nTogether with allies rarely seen\nThose forgotten, disregarded folks,\nThrown into binders, or placed between bike spokes\nYet through her power, these allies you more easily will fetch\nA daughter to her father, with an ability to match\n\nTold through the long years, these tales I have heard\nOf a mission to save a very large bird\nBut now on the horizon, a pair of wings I saw\nand heard the sound of an Eagle, a loud caw\nOnce nearly defeated, has now come back\nWith razor-sharp talons, and a deadly peck\n\nA group of people have come from far\nFour heroes, but one of them a star\nWho's light had recently been ignited\nFrom game's start, a hero knighted\nBut these heroes walked alone upon the road\nWith no-one else to carry the load\n\nA son of a father, who died at the gate\nAnd a dwarf who's ancestor shared the same fate\nYet strong and capable he swings his axe\nWhile he continues milling player decks\nThough already used by members in an alternate form\nThis hero comes to help players battle the storm\n\nWould wear a ring with total disregard\nAnd acts as though he is an encounter card\nHis songs heard from afar, through forest and down\nAnd wights flee when they hear the sound\nYet merry is he, and his wife as well\nOlder than time, among trees and rivers they dwell\n\nTo the west, I saw a creature with elven ear\nSinging songs to Hobbits, and all that would hear\nThough the songs of gulls he did fear\nHe has an ability not common in the sphere\nReleased in a product that already did appear\nTo those with a friend, this time last year\n\nFrom sleep, I was woken by a sound\nOf many footsteps from underground\nGrim faced, yet determined the walked\nAnd behind them ghosts and phantoms stalked\nThey vanished into the darkness, under the mountain's door\nAnd after that, I saw nothing more\n\n\n\nI will leave now, and go back to rest\nBut I wish everyone in this community the best\n\n--Malbeth\n\n \n\nNot sure how much is to be believed, but a work of art none the less. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299215-possible-vengeance-of-mordor-player-cards-spoiled/?do=findComment&comment=3769856","commentId":3769856,"userName":"Bullroarer

I'd love that combo.\n\nThat is a great idea and would be pretty cool. The only thing that is making me think something different is the poem/riddle lines, so let's break it down:\n\nIn a dream, I saw the spirit of Gondor returned \nThrough a princess from the sea, who's heart had yearned\nFor her husband across the mountains riding in a sea of green\n\n-This pretty much confirms without a doubt it's Lothiriel, princess from the Sea falling in love with horseback riding husband over grassy fields leaves little room for any other interpretation.\n\n\nTogether with allies rarely seen\nThose forgotten, disregarded folks,\nThrown into binders, or placed between bike spokes\n\n-Ok so here it seems to be not referring to a generic Ally trait in particular as there are lots of good Gondor and Rohan allies. Unless they mean Rohan and Gondor builds in general are less popular, but I still recall hearing something somewhere about a Gondor Spirit allies. And there are three terrible Spirit Gondor allies that you discard from play for an effect and these are: Minas Tirith Lampwright, Damrod, and the recently released Derufin. Now we can already \"Tactics Imrahil sneak attack\" them into play because of the Gondor trait but no one does this because they are still having to be discarded for not an amazing effect. So what could it be that would make us even want to play these three characters, and the most likely to me would be some kind of saving from the discard pile to the hand/shuffle into deck ability. Other options are cost reduction for Spirit Gondor allies, potentially some other effect triggering off their discarding such as placing a resource on a Gondor Hero or Eomer (which would be cool since it works with Leadership Eomer to help him recoup his cost), or something else entirely. Perhaps there is a clue in the final lines?\n\nYet through her power, these allies you more easily will fetch\nA daughter to her father, with an ability to match\n\n-This last part makes me wonder if they mean match as in work together or match as in identical power with her father? The latter would be fun but not super original and to my recollection there hasn't been two heroes released with the same ability yet. But still worth considering as it could be the same as Tactics Imrahil's ability but with different traits: \"spend 1 Spirit resource to search the top 5 or 10 (in reference to the easier to fetch) cards of your deck for an ally that shares the same trait and put it into play\" perhaps her ability could be played at any phase, or put into play until the end of the round in order to allow the Lampwright to be able to work better. Then she could have Gondor, Rohan (since she marries Eomer and they also have some great discarding effect characters) and Noble.\n\n \n\nTo me it really comes back to the mention of helping terrible characters. So it begs the question what would make these characters worth playing over the far better Gondor (or Rohan) allies that could potentially be brought into play? Her ability, whatever it is could be restricted to Spirit or even more specifically Spirit Gondor allies to force that theme, but then it just makes her a worse summoning version of her father. So it leads me to think she either has two abilities, or a different ability altogether that will help those three mentioned Gondor Spirits allies. It doesn't make sense to me to have her be able to discard an ally for an effect as there are cheaper/better Gondor allies you can discard, and if you discard for an different effect than you can't trigger their discard ability. If she had something trigger in addition to their discard effect than that is certainly an option (and if it was Gondor allies in general that are discarded from play generating an effect it would help the terrible Denethor ally as well) or a way to recur that Ally. It certainly is interesting and as someone who has longed for Gondor to be as strong as some of the other powerful builds like a Noldor, Outlands, and Silvins I would love to see a boost to the factions and especially the worst cards in those factions. \n\n \n\nIf this is a new way of doing previews, I'm totally into it and it's sweet! I'm enjoying trying to decipher the riddles.\n\n \n\nAnother thought for the is the two identical characters could be the long rumoured and hoped for Blue Wizards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299215-possible-vengeance-of-mordor-player-cards-spoiled/?do=findComment&comment=3770851","commentId":3770851,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1566754771,"content":"> On 8/24/2019 at 1:00 PM, Bullroarer Took said:\n> \n> This is pure supposition, nothing more.  I think this is FFG/ANA branching out their advertising/social media and this is the equivalent of our Friday article.\n\nHuh, that is a possibility.

Leaning towards a double-sided hero, à la Gollum, but I see it as just one hero: Gandalf. Grey and White version but with the same name (just Gandalf), for consistency reasons (if not we could have Gandalf the X + Gandalf ally/hero at the same game). Unchecked.\n 2. Lothíriel. Checked.\n 3. Wilyador hero. Yes, it's a bit lame to give the hero treatment to a FFG-made character instead of Gwaihir or Meneldor but oh well. Maybe it appears on the story of this Vengeance of Mordor cycle, too. Unchecked.\n 4. Forth, the Three Hunters contract card. Checked.\n 5. Thorin Stonehelm (I can be picky that they didn't show the hero card properly, but given the promo card and the confirmation on the product page that we'll be receiving a dwarf hero on the first AP, this is a no-brainer). Checked.\n 6. Tom Bombadil. Checked.\n 7. Gildor Inglorion. I'll also be picky here: all the odds are for this card to be in this cycle, because Thorin is in here too and because it seems that after this cycle there'll be a hiatus for the game (you can watch Andrew Navarro's AMA), so it should be the best and only cycle for him. But I'll put it as Unchecked.\n 8. Army of the Dead contract. Could be awesome as an ally but for me is very fitting to be a contract card, as the Oath that bound that people to serve Aragorn. Unchecked.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299215-possible-vengeance-of-mordor-player-cards-spoiled/?do=findComment&comment=3783569","commentId":3783569,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1568284320,"content":"Tfw second version of Gandalf hero and still no Saruman hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299215-possible-vengeance-of-mordor-player-cards-spoiled/?do=findComment&comment=3783575","commentId":3783575,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1568285264,"content":"Are we convinced the \"four heroes but one of them a star\" is referring to the three hunters contract?

And as much as I would love him to be a healing one (starts with all the excess Athelas in play from JtR!) I feel like the poem more references an attacking one. So perhaps some kind of splash damage Attack where excess damage is dealt to another enemy character or it can attack two enemies in one turn?\n\nOne of them a star makes me think Spirit Aragorn, or maybe a Fellowship one if that's the case it could be the 3 hunters one, but it just doesn't fit the rest of the poem. Was Aragorn knighted? Not to my knowledge. The hobbits were absolutely knighted by Aragorn and Eomer and there is four of them so that would be a sweet boost to have them in their scouring the Shire Mode. Also allowing you to play four hobbits would be great! You could even pair up Frodo's four friends with him (woot Fatty!) or Aragorn with the four classic Hobbits if it's not hobbit specific. They could definitely use the help and the boost.\n\nThorin for sure, nice for us to get him.\n\nHey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow! Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo! (Seriously most anticipated ally here)\n\nGildor, see #5 and combines great with leaderships main weakness.\n\nIt really seems to be referring to the people that the ghosts are stalking which totally says grey company contract to me, Dunedain are one of the weaker traits so would be nice to give them a boost that works along their engagement strategy.\n\n \n\nAll in all very excited for this cycle, it's pretty much total fan service what most of us wanted. Very much loving this game right now!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299215-possible-vengeance-of-mordor-player-cards-spoiled/?do=findComment&comment=3783777","commentId":3783777,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1568300585,"content":"> 40 minutes ago, RebelX said:\n> \n> Spirit Aragorn was often mentioned as a possibility but with both spirit spots in the cycle gone, I do not consider this likely.\n\nOne spot is Lothíriel, have I missed the other one?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299215-possible-vengeance-of-mordor-player-cards-spoiled/?do=findComment&comment=3783782","commentId":3783782,"userName":"RebelX","timestamp":1568300703,"content":"> Just now, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> One spot is Lothíriel, have I missed the other one?\n\nMy mistake!

For the sake of ease, let's say its Fili and Kili. \n\nSo you have a double sided hero (fili/kili) of different spheres, the owner of the hero chooses which side is flipped face up. The corresponding opposite ally (kili/fili) is flipped face up and placed in another player's play area.\n\nThat's why they're split, and why one has \"reached their prime\" (hero status). It also works well with both contracts released... the fellowship because it gets another ally in for a player looking to get 9 uniques, and for the three hunters because it works around the dynamic of having an ally \"in deck\". \n\nIt might not be fili/kili, it could be elladan/elrohir, or another set of twins I'm not thinking of... but I like the idea of a hero-ally setup.

And 8 we are way off eh?\n\n\nMy best guess on the 4th Hero clues is that it allows for playing with 4 Hobbit Heroes, but they each must be of a different sphere (\"one of them a star,\" I am taking to mean one is Spirit).  That seems really potent, but comes at the potential cost of secrecy, so maybe it's fine.  And four resources a turn is a lot, but if it's spread across spheres maybe that's enough of a balance?  Contract could mitigate resource gain in all sorts of ways (e.g. your heros cannot gain spheres beyond their printed sphere, your heroes may not gain resources from card effects, heck the contract could even attach to one hero and prevent that hero from having a resource pool).\n\nSo, assuming the Contract is four hobbits related, that makes (1) extra tricky. If the car is double-sided, it's hard to imagine how a double-sided card would work that is not a hero or a contract, and we \"know\" the last Hero is Aragorn and lots of people have been guessing at a dual Aragorn that flips to \"King Elessar,\" but that doesn't quite capture the \"not by the same player at the same time\" aspect of the riddle.  So maybe it's a pair of single-sided cards, but a player can only have one of them in play at a time?  Could two players have the pair in play at the same time?  It's weird to think of a card dynamic that \"required\" multiplayer (or 2-Handed) to use.  Maybe even something like a Beorning/Grimbeorn ally who could \"transform\" into an out-of-play Bear form?  Still doesn't quite seem to capture the spirit of the riddle...\n\nI'm totally stumped on this one, which makes it so intriguing and exciting.\n\nEdited May 13 by EBerling"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299215-possible-vengeance-of-mordor-player-cards-spoiled/?do=findComment&comment=3945417","commentId":3945417,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1590645612,"content":"Alright just to finally resolve all aspects of this riddle:\n\n \n\n1) Thorongil, definitely allows “2 heroes to be in play at the same time while splitting between them”\n\n4) 4 heroes contract one of each sphere and the no one else to shoulder the load must have been referring to the no other hero can help pay for the out of sphere cards of the other three\n\n8.) so seeing the last pack of cards.. like is this one of the Dunedain cards or event?

The Three Hunters contract, as they have no other characters on that road. But I don't understand why this couldn't be 3 different paragraphs. Maybe to throw us off?\n\n8 did sound like a Grey Company contract or something, but looking at the cards we have now, it might just reference the fact that we got some Dunedain cards towards the end.
