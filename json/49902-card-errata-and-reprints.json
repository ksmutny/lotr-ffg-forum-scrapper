From the back the card looks exactly like any other, feels the same thickness etc and is a usable UC when drawn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49902-card-errata-and-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=689019","commentId":689019,"userName":"Zoso","timestamp":1346942720,"content":" In AGOT, eratta'd cards have always been corrected when their corresponding packs/sets have been reprinted. So I would assume they will do the same for LOTR. They don't generally reprint them just for the sole purpose of correcting cards, so you'll have to wait until they sellout and need reprints, but those should contain corrected cards."}]}
