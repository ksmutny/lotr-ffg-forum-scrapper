You’ll also find cards that promote the construction of mono-sphere decks and that represent the effective traps, ambushes, and skirmishes that Ithilien’s scouts andRangers use to weaken their foes. Altogether, it’s a wide array of cards to support multiple new strategies, and you’ll need everything you can find to confront the Orc and Southron hordes and reclaim the city.\n\n \n\nSo we've got the Palantír and eight more player cards (not counting the hero). In those eight cards we're to see support for both Gondor and Outlands, support for mono-sphere decks, support for traps? Even a single more Outlands ally will be enough to strengthen the faction yet some more (especially if not of the Leadership sphere). I hope to see yet another trap surely but perhaps even better a card that fishes it out from the deck, though it is more likely we will see the already spoilt Anborn that brings a trap back from the discard pile. More than the above, I'm really hoping for a strong Gondor card, and by that I mean a card that strengthens a strictly thematic Gondor deck. Like: if all your heroes have the printed (!) Gondor trait, you... eh... win the game? No, not quite like that, but a decent ability to be sure.\n\n \n\nAnd above all, I'm looking forward to see a strong Faramir hero card. We've been getting many articles lately, though more often dealing with the future saga or errata, could it be we see Faramir previewed today? Amon Din was out at the very beginning of July, I'm thinking Osgiliath cannot be far off..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87375-much-to-expect-from-the-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=825333","commentId":825333,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1375083287,"content":"I dont really care about Player cards to be honest.

I would certainly like to see a Gondor specific card there, the one requiring all Gondor heroes to be in the line-up.\n\n \n\nLore\n\nYes, more traps, and probably Anborn. It is a bit far-fetched, but I'd like to see a trap that makes resources, like: once the attached enemy leaves play, add a number of resources equal to its threat to one of your heroes (perhaps a bit too strong, but something like that - and making sense also, like getting information out of someone, though that would thematically more likely transformed into cards).\n\n \n\nSpirit\n\nNo idea. An ally would be nice.\n\n \n\nTactics\n\nDefinitely a weapon, a must, pretty please? (I know it's been printed.) I wouldn't mind seeing an attack modifier but it is not probably where they're going with Gondor. It is hard to beat the big villains like Smaug without an army of allies at the moment...

The great thing was we've been getting more articles again but they're usually about the faq or saga, not the upcoming packs. So whilst I desperately want to know the hero, I'm doubtful we'll see it here before someone spoils it.\n\nAlso the upcoming page has just been updated but it can be the pack had been heading to stores for some time already.

We were two players. I dont know if we made something wrong because of the hurry, but the first time it was really easy and I was wondering where was the 8 difficulty. Any way I recognize that we were really lucky with the encounter cards that first time. We won just when a mumakil came from the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nSecond time was different. We won again but striving more to achive it. We didnt suffer too much as in Ithilien or Cair Andros, but the threat of losing the game was very present. This time we saw the real potential of this quest. It has a different \"tempo\" than Ithilien or Cair Andros. It has power but at least let you take position and the problems come like waves.\n\n \n\nI think the difficulty of this quest depends a lot on the cards that are drawing from the encounter deck and certain combinations between them. Imagine a first round with a mumakil and a Mordor Lt. And I think two players mode is precisely the easiest way to beat it.\n\n \n\n4 players will sweat a lot I think, because the encounter deck is full of hard enemies and treacheries and 4 cards in the quest phase at the same time with this encounter deck could be too much.\n\n \n\nA solo player is almost suicide (that's the reason of the 8) because you need help to explore and take control of the locations (some locations ask you to spend resources or exhaust heroes to put progress tokens on it).\n\n \n\nOwning the locations gives some power to the enemies according to the number of locations that you own. Imagine if you as solo player have all of them and all the bonus of the enemies are applicable only against you to the maximum. With more players the locations of Osgiliath are shared, and the bonus for the enemies is reduced with each player.\n\n \n\nOf course, Osgiliath locations that you own can be lost for different reasons as losing a character, let an attack undefended, etc. In that case they return to the staging area.\n\n \n\nI think is a great quest and I've liked. Ithilien and Cair Andros are always too thug. AoO seems can be everything, a walk or a hell I think. And the hell comes surely if it takes you much time to accomplished the quest.\n\n \n\nI must be sure that I made everything right and play it again. I'm sure it will be ruthless the next time so I must not be over confident.\n\n \n\nIts a good quest. Buy it. :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]\n\n \n\nPD: We played with monosphere Lore and Spirit. In Spirit I use Spiritfindel and he is a little cheat i must say.

The lore event that was spoiled which in erases engage,net cost by 5 is perfect and it decreases in cost by hobbit or ranger heroes.

When playing a Hobbit deck I think of these three frightened halflings who need every help they can to make it through the quest. Or you have to take it as a challenge. To build a deck with a theme that is not supposed to win against a certain scenario is such a deck building challenge. For example, it took me more than 20 failed approaches to finally build a mono tactics deck that was winning against Amon Din more than half of the games. That's kind of playing in nightmare mode (in which the nightmare is that all dwarves have vanished ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ).\n\nEdited August 6, 2013 by leptokurt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87375-much-to-expect-from-the-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=832867","commentId":832867,"userName":"Troymk1","timestamp":1375826077,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > I dont really care about Player cards to be honest.

Thalin, Beregond and Legolas on one side and New Boromir, Mirlonde and Faramir on the other.\n\n \n\nThe game experience changed quite a lot, as the scenario becomes much more challenging with two players. It's a struggle from start to end (in my case: loss after reaching the threat limit after about 13 turns), but all these new cards and synergies allow you to use different startegies to handle threat and enemies without dominating the encounter deck. Everyone who is playing this multiplayer will cry from joy!\n\n \n\nThe only downside was Faramir, who wasn't as useful as expected. His ability never came into play, but that's partly because the deck's high threat cost and Legolas need to kill enemies don't support him really much. Guess I'm going to change it to a mono lore deck instead."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87375-much-to-expect-from-the-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=835478","commentId":835478,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1376078953,"content":"I just picked up my pack and there is more to this than meets the eye.  On the instruction sheet it explains that even though you might explore a location, it doesn't really leave play.  The first player takes control of the location, but all of its effects are still active.  I think the crapshoot analogy is spot on here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87375-much-to-expect-from-the-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=835706","commentId":835706,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1376094149,"content":"Just played my first game solo and won on turn two.

In the beginning I accidently played it like I had to explore all locations (missed the \"in play\" bit). Welll, there is a total of 14 Osgiliath locations.
