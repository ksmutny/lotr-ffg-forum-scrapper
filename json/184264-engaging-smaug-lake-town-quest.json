So i played it like he would the one defense boost (but it doesn't matter i lost the game anyway...)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184264-engaging-smaug-lake-town-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1721992","commentId":1721992,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1438806815,"content":"It is not. The only thing which is considered optional engagement is the optional engagement you get to make during the encounter phase according to the core rulebook (or the two optionals if you're using Halbarad). Nothing else counts as optional engagement, even if you are deliberately choosing to trigger an effect to engage an enemy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184264-engaging-smaug-lake-town-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1723139","commentId":1723139,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1438868936,"content":"Thanks for helping me with this  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
