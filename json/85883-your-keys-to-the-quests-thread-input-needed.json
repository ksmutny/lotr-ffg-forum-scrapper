Most quests in this game have a 'key'....that is strategy that when you discover or unlock it, the quest becomes much easier to win.\n\n \n\nAn example of this is Conflict at the Carrock. The key here is quest slow, build forces, lower threat, engage trolls 1 by 1. Simple.\n\n \n\nSome however are not so obvious, and i would really like all your opinions on what your 'keys' are. Then, if i get enough, i shall make a list here, and update this first post. Hopefully it shall be useful.\n\n \n\nSo if you would, please post the quest name, and a short description (step by step if you can) of the key to winning it. There wil of course be several ways of winning each quest.\n\n \n\nHere is one of my own and an easy one:\n\nJourney Down The Anduin\n\n \n\n-step 1: low start threat.\n\n-step 2: build up allies in play\n\n-step 3: engage troll and either a) take a hit off it, or b) feint it\n\n-step 4: kill it! hopefully you have enough allies in play to take it down in 1 go. if not try to forest snare it, or have another feint ready. it is best to take it in 1 turn though. rivendell blade is especially good for this as are cheap eagle allies such as vassel of the windlord\n\n-step 5: on 2b use high questing power, with a staging area hitter such as dunhere or yew bow, to keep it relatively clear. Make sure to not let location build up and use asfaloth/ancestral knowledge etc. or just travel\n\n-step 6: be prepared for 3b. lots of cards are going to come out which can be daunting, however they will be the last cards in general as the staging step is skipped from this point onwards. its especially important then to keep a clear staging area in 2b.\n\n \n\nRich\n\nEdited July 5, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85883-your-keys-to-the-quests-thread-input-needed/?do=findComment&comment=809070","commentId":809070,"userName":"hildargo","timestamp":1373093619,"content":"Into Ithilien:\n\nStep 1: Pray"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85883-your-keys-to-the-quests-thread-input-needed/?do=findComment&comment=809126","commentId":809126,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373111881,"content":"indeed!...still if anyone has a decent way to do ithillien i think there'd be more than me willing to hear it..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85883-your-keys-to-the-quests-thread-input-needed/?do=findComment&comment=809137","commentId":809137,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1373115776,"content":"> indeed!...still if anyone has a decent way to do ithillien i think there'd be more than me willing to hear it...\n\n> indeed!...still if anyone has a decent way to do ithillien i think there'd be more than me willing to hear it...\n\nIn solo for into ithillien you need to recognize that you need to quest for a minimum of 11. Ithillen road needs 4 progress, the southern company has 3 threat and the highest threat cards in the in the encounter deck are 4. Celador gives you 2 battle, so not relying on any other allies you need to have three heroes with 3 attack, and you are certain to clear the road every time. My best combination of heroes were Glorfindel spirit, Aragorn Lore, and Boromir Tactics. They would be even stronger with some of the cards in the new APs.\n\nOf course this all changes in multi player. I really like thalin in multi player. Khazad! Khazad! Work s realy nice for the battle quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85883-your-keys-to-the-quests-thread-input-needed/?do=findComment&comment=809143","commentId":809143,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1373118366,"content":"> Into Ithilien:\n> \n> Step 1: Pray\n\n \n\n:lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]\n\n \n\nLaughed a lot ....

Straight Shot really shines in this scenario vs. Thrasing and Grasping Tentacles.  Or the ol' Thalin+Gondorian Spearman+Spear of the Citadel, or Thalin+Goblin-cleaver combos.\n\n \n\nStage 2: Try to have a lot of cards in your hand before getting to this stage, including some scrying options (Longbeard Elder is my favorite here).  If you can see the top card of the encounter deck, getting the Doors of Durin into your victory display becomes a trivial matter.  Card draw is important here so that you have lots of options in your hand for discard.  Alternatively, defeat the Watcher.  This is typically more difficult with more players in the game -- he can't be engaged unless there are no Tentacles on the table.  If you're planning to engage him, Son of Arnor is a good card to have in your hand.  After that you just need the damage to take him out. \n\n \n\nI typically do this scenario 2-player.  It is a shorter scenario, and it can either be a walk in the park of Tentacle Mania, depending on your encounter deck draw.  Your first questing phase might occasionally look like Stagnant Creek + Tentacle + Stagnant Creek + Tentacle, in which case you are in for a good time!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85883-your-keys-to-the-quests-thread-input-needed/?do=findComment&comment=809492","commentId":809492,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1373183113,"content":"> didnt recognise you there leptokurt!\n> \n> thanks for the input!\n\nYep, I chose to be more abstract. :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85883-your-keys-to-the-quests-thread-input-needed/?do=findComment&comment=809541","commentId":809541,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1373195762,"content":">  \n> \n> stage 1\n> \n>  \n> \n> - Beorn + Boromir + Celador = 11 points during first turn\n> \n>  \n> \n> - afterward play lots of cheap Gondor allies and use Boromir's ATT boost to take out the enemies or add them to the quest\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n\nThat combo will give you 10 battle quest first turn, but a one attack ally can change that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85883-your-keys-to-the-quests-thread-input-needed/?do=findComment&comment=809550","commentId":809550,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1373199902,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > stage 1\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > - Beorn + Boromir + Celador = 11 points during first turn\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > - afterward play lots of cheap Gondor allies and use Boromir's ATT boost to take out the enemies or add them to the quest\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> >  \n> \n> That combo will give you 10 battle quest first turn, but a one attack ally can change that.\n> \n>  \n\nNo. Celador gets boosted by Boromir's ability up to 3 ATT."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85883-your-keys-to-the-quests-thread-input-needed/?do=findComment&comment=809578","commentId":809578,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1373205843,"content":"> > > stage 1\n> > > \n> > >  \n> > > \n> > > - Beorn + Boromir + Celador = 11 points during first turn\n> > > \n> > >  \n> > > \n> > > - afterward play lots of cheap Gondor allies and use Boromir's ATT boost to take out the enemies or add them to the quest\n> > \n> > That combo will give you 10 battle quest first turn, but a one attack ally can change that.\n> \n> No. Celador gets boosted by Boromir's ability up to 3 ATT.\n\nGot it!
