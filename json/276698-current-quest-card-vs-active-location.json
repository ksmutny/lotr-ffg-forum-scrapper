If the effect is about anything else, such as removing progress, then it affects the quest card not the active location.\n\nNote a particular special case: if a player card attempts to place progress on the current quest but the active location is \"Immune to player card effects\" then the progress fails to be placed. No, I don't think it makes sense either."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276698-current-quest-card-vs-active-location/?do=findComment&comment=3350689","commentId":3350689,"userName":"bitzurock","timestamp":1527405425,"content":"Thank you!"}]}
