It says:\n\nFinal Threat Level + Threat Cost of Each Dead Hero + Damage Tokens on Heroes - Victory Points Earned = Final Score\n\nMy question is: what are Victory Points? I played the first scenario and didn't run into any...\n\nThanks!\n\nJavier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48131-victory-points/?do=findComment&comment=482858","commentId":482858,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1307614966,"content":"Certain encounter cards have a line at the bottom right that says: victory then a number next to it. You earn those by defeating the creature or explore the location that has them. You then leave that card next to your threat dial, you don't put in the encounter discard. On the first scenario cards like Chieftain Ufthak and Hummerhorns have them. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48131-victory-points/?do=findComment&comment=482863","commentId":482863,"userName":"DeeJay507","timestamp":1307615381,"content":"Hi,\n\nVictory Points are sometimes listed on specific encounter cards. See Hummerhorns or Chieftain Ufthak in scenario #1. You will get a lot more cards with victory points in next scenarios.\n\nEDIT: @Titan -> eh, you were first :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
