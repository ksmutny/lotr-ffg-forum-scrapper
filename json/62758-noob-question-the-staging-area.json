This is probably an easy one. I've read the areas of the rules related to the staging area and I still haven't found a specific rule on how many cards can be in the staging area at any given time. As a side question, how is the term staging doesn't show in the topic index at the end of the book?\n\nThe rules (p15-16) show that a number of cards equal to the number of players are played to the staging area from the encounter deck... but it doesn't say if there is a limit to how many cards can be IN the staging area. Is it limited to the number of players or can I end up with half a dozen unexplored locations stretching all the way across the table?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62758-noob-question-the-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=614220","commentId":614220,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1333667319,"content":" There's no limit.  If you get an unlucky stream of locations, or if everyone's threat is really low, you could conceivably have a ton of cards in the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62758-noob-question-the-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=614221","commentId":614221,"userName":"guest479094","timestamp":1333667639,"content":" Couple of Northern Trackers to the rescue :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62758-noob-question-the-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=614241","commentId":614241,"userName":"PorthmeusGames","timestamp":1333674554,"content":" That's what I suspected, but wanted to clarify as I'd read something different elsewhere. \n\nThanks for the info!"}]}
