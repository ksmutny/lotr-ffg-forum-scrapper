These will most likely all be solo games and I will be starting at the beginning of the quest lines and working my way forward.\n\nI'm going to be using a semi limited card pool. A Cycle pool so to speak. Meaning, that each delux expantion has its own associated 6 pack cycle.. and that is a pool. So the Mirkwood Pool is CORE + The Mirkwood cycle. The Darowdelf Pool is CORE + The Mirkwood cycle + Kaz + the Darrowdelf cycle. Etc etc.\n\nI'm going to try and show a different deck every time, and will attempt to not favor any sphere or hero.. Though that may be hard at the start as Lore / Spirit was really so strong!\n\nHope you enjoy it ...\n\nHave Fun and ROLL HIGH!\n--Tragic\n\n\nThe Tragic Quests of Middle Earth\nFull Playlist [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyyQgJXgN4c6oNrOpg5NKHz9NZspcX-CZ]\n\nMirkwood Cycle\n\n * Passage Through Mirkwood [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM63bvSBDFk&feature=share&list=PLyyQgJXgN4c6oNrOpg5NKHz9NZspcX-CZ] -

You can basically play it blindfolded. Yet here is a deck to beat it! WOOT.\n\nWhile The Hills of Emyn Muil can be a bit of a problem with 4 players (starting threat 12 + 4 reveals ramps it a bit) compared to modern quests even then it is not that hard.\n\nThere is only 1 monsters that is under 30 threat in this deck, so the goal is to just quest though the locations and never have to deal with the mobs at all.\n\nAlways quest with Frodo in case a Dol Guldur Orcs is revealed, so you can eat the dmg in threat.

So expect more vids and chat from me!\n\n \n\n> As far as the deck goes, Putting a Master of the Forge or two in the deck can eliminate the problem that Imladris Stargazer has. I used to run a similar deck, but with Mirlonde instead of Frodo and a metric ton of elves. Glaurung has a video of a similar deck.\n\n \n\nThanks for the input.. here are some of my thoughts on the matter.\n\n \n\nThe problem with Master of the Forge in this particular deck is the dead draw. While yes, any card that shuffles the deck gives Stargazer a great boost. The fact is that in most games you are drawing 2 cards a turn, and this is really strong as you have a 2 card peak, 2 card draw. That is pretty strong. Also, due to the threat requirements of this deck you need Will of the West to cycle Gandalf and threat reduction events. This card also shuffles the deck. So you can basically use it for this same purpose and free up any slots you were using on Master. You have 2 mulligans, a stargaze, that is a 17 card peak (kind of) plus you have normal draw AND 2 optional shuffles with Will of the West for another 10 card peak. .... It is pretty rare for the combo to not come out and get stuck in that stargaze problem\n\n \n\nAs for the heroes... well I went with 2 spirit as I wanted the opportunity to cast a greeting for 6 threat reduction every single round. Each turn I get 3 spirit (with Vilya). Frodo is a great choice for this quest as in Stage 2 there are no engagement checks so you do not have to worry about threat that much, and in Stage 3 there is no new encounter cards so you can plan exactly what you are doing at the start of the turn, meaning that again.. threat gain is not really an issue. I think it is one of the \"best\" quest to abuse his ability."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84233-the-tragic-quests-of-middle-earth/?do=findComment&comment=1818055","commentId":1818055,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1443153829,"content":"That's fine. But I'm not talking about getting the combo out or this quest in particular. I'm talking about the power of the deck in the long run. Just after refresh I tap stargazer to arrange the top five:\n\n1. Cheap event\n\n2. Expensive card\n\n3. Useful attachment\n\n4. Blah\n\n5. Blah\n\nDraw phase, draw cheap event. Planning, exhaust Elrond and Vilya to out the expense card into play. Then exhaust Master to get the attachment and stir the deck. The exact order can be mixed up depending on the situation, but you get three great cards a turn, rinse and repeat. (Vilya can play Greetings too.)\n\nIt's a powerful deck no doubt, and Frodo can certainly help on quests where you risk having a fatty engage you early. But I think in terms of general power you are better off having an extra lore resource per turn because generally the lore cards are the expensive ones.\n\nEdited September 25, 2015 by Bullroarer Took"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84233-the-tragic-quests-of-middle-earth/?do=findComment&comment=1818168","commentId":1818168,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1443162022,"content":"cool cool, yes that is a strong way to go.. assuming you have attachment targets, which this deck has very few. Tthe thing is as I ma using a restricted card pool anyway, it is hard to make \"power decks\" and on top of that I design a new deck for each quest so there is some variety in the videos. So they are kind of tailored.\n\n \n\nThere are very few lore cards in the deck. Most are in fact Tactics and nearly completely rely on Vilya to pay for them. The only cards that require a high cost that need easy casting is really the spirit event -  O Elbereth! Gilthonial! @4xSpirit. and The Galadhrim's Greeting @3xSpirit.\n\n \n\nAlso this quest the shadow cards a pretty weak and can mainly be ignored, apart from a few acceptations. One of those acceptations bounces a tapped body into your hand. With 2 spirit Heroes from turn 1 you are able to bounce stargazer and then put her back down at the start of the next round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84233-the-tragic-quests-of-middle-earth/?do=findComment&comment=1818419","commentId":1818419,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1443182117,"content":">  \n> \n> > As always, great game and the only LOTR LCG video with a nice *****.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Now I'm going to have to watch the video, just to find out what a ***** is!\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nWell, it's furry and got censured by the forum when I posted it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84233-the-tragic-quests-of-middle-earth/?do=findComment&comment=1871343","commentId":1871343,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1446211120,"content":"The Redhorn Gate - (Shadow Pool)\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDeck : Snow Boots [http://goo.gl/4wW3OS] @CardGameDB\n\nQuest: The Redhorn Gate [https://goo.gl/UZrsWh]\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84233-the-tragic-quests-of-middle-earth/?do=findComment&comment=1872377","commentId":1872377,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1446238662,"content":"Nice game!
