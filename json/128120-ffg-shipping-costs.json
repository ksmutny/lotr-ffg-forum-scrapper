That's outrageous! Shipping should only cost about 3 bucks for a little pack.. especially considering the 4 board games I bought from the FFG sale had only $16 in shipping.\n\nIs it just because the Old Forest is POD or is shipping always bad directly from FFG on small packs?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128120-ffg-shipping-costs/?do=findComment&comment=1351107","commentId":1351107,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1417293116,"content":"I seem to remember trying to buy some card sleeves through their online store at one point, and ending up going somewhere else because the shipping fee was not reasonable."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128120-ffg-shipping-costs/?do=findComment&comment=1352837","commentId":1352837,"userName":"Crabble","timestamp":1417456373,"content":"Maybe these high shipping costs will get lower with Ashmodee on board because of their Europe distribution network.

What's really bad is that I can go to a store, buy the POD expansion and go to the post office and mail it to myself cheaper than what FFG is quoting. And I'm using the same shipping method. It's pathetic. This is in the US btw. >_>"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128120-ffg-shipping-costs/?do=findComment&comment=1353379","commentId":1353379,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1417489810,"content":"Ditto FFG's shipping costs putting me off ordering print on demand or sleeves (that are semi permanently out of stock locally) via there online store..."}]}
