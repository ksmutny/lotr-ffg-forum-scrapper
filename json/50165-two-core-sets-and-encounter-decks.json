Should I use both Core Sets to build the encounter decks since there will be the exact same chance of getting a card out?\n\nFor example, if for the encounter forest deck I had 2 of a card, now I have 4 and double the cards. Does it make sense?\n\nThanks,\n\nJavier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50165-two-core-sets-and-encounter-decks/?do=findComment&comment=501661","commentId":501661,"userName":"hawkeyespf","timestamp":1311077657,"content":"No, the encounter decks are designed to be used as they are in ONE core set.\n\n \n\nWhat a lot of people with multiple core sets do is use the second set to put together a \"permament\" encounter deck for the 2nd or 3rd quest so they don't have to pull the first one apart."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50165-two-core-sets-and-encounter-decks/?do=findComment&comment=501788","commentId":501788,"userName":"Maggical","timestamp":1311090237,"content":"hawkeyespf said:\n\nNo, the encounter decks are designed to be used as they are in ONE core set.\n\n \n\nWhat a lot of people with multiple core sets do is use the second set to put together a \"permament\" encounter deck for the 2nd or 3rd quest so they don't have to pull the first one apart.\n\n\n\nThanks for the help!
