At beginning of quest phase (via quest card) you can turn over your hidden cards. If you do and this enemy is one, he triggers by dealing 3 damage and returns to staging area. At that point, does his Archery 3 trigger?\n\nÂ \n\nI lean toward no, as I consider the \"at the start of combat phase\" (when archery takes place) to have come and gone, and he wasn't in play at that time. But I'm not 100% sure, as I can see an argument the other way too, saying the \"at the start of combat phase\" is ongoing. Thoughts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190536-archery-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=1835973","commentId":1835973,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1444107521,"content":"When multiple effects are triggered at the same time you can choose the order to trigger them one at a time. So in this case you could start the combat phase by assigning archery damage, then deal a shadow card to each engaged enemy, and finally decide to reveal hhidden cards (which won't get a shadow card OR assign archery damage since you've already finished those triggered steps)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190536-archery-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=1836050","commentId":1836050,"userName":"JYoder","timestamp":1444112594,"content":"Ah, sure. Didn't think of that since there was no Archery at the time, but it makes sense to think of it that way. Good call. Thanks."}]}
