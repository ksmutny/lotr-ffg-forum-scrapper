Theoretically in the time frame the game takes place in Grima may not have fallen to evil just yet and may not have been an agent for Saruman just yet either. Seventeen years is a pretty decent chunk of time and he may have turned like halfway through this time frame which leaves a good 8 or so years during which he may well have been actually looking out for Theodens interests and may still have been a genuine advisor. \n\nAt the end of the day though he is a man of Rohan and is only evil or an enemy once he turns and becomes a spy for Saruman.\n\nTechnically Saruman should fall into this category as well as he was originally noble but also turned to evil at some point. \n\nThe corsairs and people of Umbar have been enemies of the free peoples since the downfall of Numenor during the second age. Yes we know that the Haradrim, men of Rhun, Dunlendings etc are not necessarily \"evil\" races of men but have simply been influenced/enslaved by the Dark Lord or in the case of the Dunlendings have faced many hardships and set backs and so have turned to savages and mainly ally with Saruman to get revenge on the Rohirrim who displaced them. These are all groups of people that are in league with the Dark Lord or are considered to be evil/savage and have been for quite some time. We have no idea when or why Grima changed his allegiances. So while I totally get where you are coming from I definitely disagree and think there is a massive difference between being given an early version of a character who was originally good and turned and being given a character from a race that we have always known to be completely in league with the Dark lord and have always considered to be \"evil\" or at least allied with and a supporter of the great enemy. \n\nTo be completely completely honest I am a little disappointed/skeptical that they have made her into a hero. I mean it was obvious that we would get her or Sahir but I actually really wished that they just appeared again/multiple times as objective allies rather than getting an actual hero version of her. She makes 0 thematic sense in the vast majority of scenarios and it will just feel so wrong playing her in any quest before the Dreamchaser cycle. Hell even in the Dreamchaser cycle there will be AT LEAST 2 or 3 quests and potentially more which you cannot use her in anyway because her ally/enemy version is already part of the scenario. \n\nAnything prior to Dreamchaser cycle just makes zero sense using her ESPECIALLY most of the Against the Shadow cycle which has you fighting Black Numenorians and in some quests (Peril in Pelargir) you are fighting human spies and thugs (and the Umbar assassin!!) who are most likely FROM Umbar. The narrative and reason for why she has betrayed her homeland and sided with the free peoples has not taken place or been explained at this point in the game so she just makes zero sense.\n\nHaving hobbits, eagles, ents, ponies WHATEVER appear in mines or on ships or having Dwarves fight alongside Elves or having Grima/Saruman feature in quests after they have already become evil are all unthematic as well but for some reason seem far more acceptable and reasonable than having a hero that is essentially from Umbar and potentially descended from Black Numenorians. I'm not even that overly obsessed with theme (more than happy putting Steward on anyone etc) but for some reason this particular inclusion in the game just seems completely wrong to me. \n\nEven a Dunlending hero would have been better as not only did we very specifically ally with a handful of them in the actual game narrative but they are far less \"evil\" than the Umbar or Haradrim in that they are more just savages and feral than actually bad or evil. They are simply a displaced people who have bad blood with the Rohirrim and if anything feel like they themselves have been wronged. The Umbar, Haradrim, Easterlings etc serve the Dark Lord and are well aware of the things he does and is capable of, they serve in fear and whether or not they consider themselves evil per say theres no way that they don't realise how dark and truly terrible he is. They are exposed to the Ring wraiths and other fell creatures, have to fight side by side with Orcs and Trolls and worse. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220127-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2224351","commentId":2224351,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1463622689,"content":"Basically, I hear you saying you'll get over it.  Not that you're saying that you'll get over it, but that you're saying you've gotten over Eagles in Moria.  This too will become OK in time.\n\n \n\nAlso, the art from the Grima card comes from art of Grima standing with Saruman.  And his ability Dooms you.  He's totally turned already."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220127-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2224379","commentId":2224379,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1463624706,"content":"Just give us hero Saruman already FFG!

I will more than likely never use the Na'aisayah hero in any way. I have only found myself being more and more of a stickler for theme as I get more into the game and these days when there are unthematic allies (attachments and events are not as important) in my decks I strive to remove them even if it slightly weakens the deck. Currently trying to replace copies of Envoy of Pelargir simply because they are not Elven. \n\nPretty much so long as something is fairly thematic or I can at least create head cannon for why it is thematic (for example Azain Silverbeard in Elvish decks because they already feature Gimli because Legolas is also part of the decks and he and Gimli are inseparable by the end and are responsible for massively improving dwarf/elf relations therefore Azain might be a dwarf who is close to or follows Gimli and hence is also more agreeable around Elves than most dwarves would be) then I will include it. If I can't even make up a believable narrative in my own head as to why a card could be included then I will not run it. \n\nI cannot think of any reason that an Umbar Corsair would be so far from home, travelling around and helping the free peoples prior to the events of the Dreamchaser cycle. Even if there WAS a corsair who tried to do this there would probably be too much distrust and anger from the people and Men of the West and they would not fight alongside or with such an individual. \n\nAlso just for the record I never had any issue with Eagles in Moria, I just listed it because its a pretty main point of contention when it comes to theme and whatnot and so I thought I would state that it is something I don't have issue with yet do have issue with this hero. \n\nHmmmmmm very good point that his art depicts him standing with Saruman though.... and yes he does give doomed....\n\nif he has turned already then its a pretty stupid card to be honest.... I like to think that it is Saruman and Grima after they have turned but before ANYONE is aware of this fact and they are still keeping up an act. Perhaps Grima is constantly making trips to Orthanc for Theodon and Rohan as an emissary and through this he is eventually swayed by Saruman to serve him as well and ultimately betray his original master for Saruman's gain. Also just to prove my point that I am not at all indicating I will get over it I have no played Grima either and probably never will. The very idea of playing with him feels traitorous and wrong  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] \n\nI've also never used the Saruman ally.\n\nEven when I eventually take my Elven decks apart and create some great thematic Rohan/Gondor decks I will not even consider Grima in the Rohan lineup. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220127-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2224455","commentId":2224455,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1463630310,"content":"Yeah I think it's probably intended that we are getting Grima before he turns.  They just didn't want to commission additional art so they cropped the VOI cover art for both Saruman and Grima...

Usually they put important characters in there (Dain, Elrond, Theoden, Erkenbrand, Arwen), who, in most cases, foreshadow the theme of the nex cycle (not true for Elrond and Erkenbrand).
