As someone always points out, they could've done 2 copies of every card and be done with that.\n\nHowever, I'm okay with the Core Set as is. I only have 1 Core Set, but I have never felt I needed to buy more to enjoy the game and have fair chance against every scenario released so far.\n\n \n\nFrom the article it looks like FFG is making 'Second Breakfast' a regular thing.\n\n\nIf these articles are meant to provide inside view of the game from designer's perspective, that's great, I love the idea and I will definitely check back regularly for more.\n\nBut if these articles just continue to provide how to make lateast released mediocre cards (such as Great Yew Bow and Bard) work in a deck by adding super over powered card (like Glorfindel) along with MULTIPLE COPIES OF CORE SET, they should stop, because it really isn't helping them at all - already yet another discussion about their marketing tactics has been rekindled and that can't be a good thing.\n\nThe deck they posted doesn't even need those extra cards from second core set, drop 5 cards (Feint, Test of Will, HoN, UC, Light in the Dark) and add in any combination of following cards to make up for the loss: Ancient Mathom / Vassal of Windlord / Winged Guardian.\n\nInfact, if I wanted to centralized Bard even more, I'd get rid of Legolas and add in a Leadership Hero (perhaps Theodred or brand new Balin), add in bunch of Dunedain Marks, Erran Rider so now you have 6 cards that can shuffle resources in turn 1, some cheap 1 cost leadership allies, 2 copies of Steward of Gondor. That would give you so many choices that you wouldn't even need to consider adding cards from second Core Set.\n\nAll in all, I don't know why they decided to post yet another deck that requires 2 core set to flame the old arguement, when they could have easily posted equally functioning (if not better) deck featuring Bard using 1 Core Set.\n\n \n\nEdit: That was a bit of negative comment…. I should add that I only sometimes comment negative stuff about this game because otherwise it is wonderful and flawless game and I think designers did excellent job especially with the new Hobbit box and HoN quests.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81066-about-elronds-counsel-in-the-news-article/?do=findComment&comment=776113","commentId":776113,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1363802599,"content":"Negative or not. your point is tottally right;\n\n \n\nThey should encourage people to try and build fun and winning decks without having to buy more than one copy of each pack they released for the game;"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81066-about-elronds-counsel-in-the-news-article/?do=findComment&comment=776131","commentId":776131,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1363805885,"content":"Dain Ironfoot said:\n\nRapier said:\n\n \n\nValyrian Steel said:\n\n \n\nI believe the annoyance is due to every deck FFG putting out requiring more than one core set :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nExactly.\n\nIt's even more annoying now that I have 3 copies of black arrow and 3 copies of a path of need.
