Here's how it works:\n\n \n\nI have a little program that randomly outputs a list of 6 heroes and one scenario. I will post a list of a dozen or so outputs from the program in the opening post of the thread. In a first-come first-serve basis you can claim one of the outputs.\n\n \n\nSometime in the next month, you have to build a pair of decks with those 6 heroes (split them between the decks however you want), and use them against the given scenario, and write up a report telling us all how it went (you can be very brief or very detailed, there are no requirements).\n\n \n\nTo claim a set of heroes just reply to the forum with your choice. Only one person can claim each option. Finally, if you don't like any of the options, or if you want an extra challenge, you can choose option X, which means I will generate one new set of heroes and a scenario and assign it to you. There is no limit on the number of people who can claim option X.\n\n \n\nHere's the list!\n\n \n\n 1.

It is obvious what I should choose for one deck: Lore/Spirit!\n\n \n\nI want to get plenty of use out of my strong heroes, Elrond in particular. I plan to use Elrond as my main defender, because of Burning Brand. To make him really good, though, I'll want a lot of readying, and Sentinel. So, I want Arwen to boost his defence and give him sentinel. Miruvor, Unexpected Courage, Light of valinor for readying. Test of will and Hasty Stroke, naturally. How do I get spirit? I'll take three Vilyas, as well as Rivendell Minstrel with Song of Travel. With Elrond and Faramir, the Minstrel is affordable and decent in her own right. I pair the Lore heroes with Theodred, who will save up resources until I get the Song, and make sure to feed Elrond a resource most turns. I put in a bunch of sensible 2-cost Lore allies. i don't bother with Stargazer because I'm not looking to make this a dedicated Vilya deck; I'll only use Vilya when there's nothing better to do.\n\n \n\nThis deck is called Deck Two in the report, and can be seen here: http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/thelordoftherings/the-lord-of-the-rings-deck-share?p=36878&deck=lotrdeck_5618c457c4267 [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/thelordoftherings/the-lord-of-the-rings-deck-share?p=36878&deck=lotrdeck_5618c457c4267]\n\n \n\nThe leadership/tactics deck is relatively straightforward, being based on equipping Elladan with weapons and Elrond with armour, and a collection of defensive allies and Ents to deal with swarms of goblins. This deck I call Deck One below, and it can be seen here http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/thelordoftherings/the-lord-of-the-rings-deck-share?p=36878&deck=lotrdeck_5618c29ed236e [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/thelordoftherings/the-lord-of-the-rings-deck-share?p=36878&deck=lotrdeck_5618c29ed236e]\n\n \n\n \n\nTHE GAME\n\n \n\nStarting hands:\n\n \n\nDeck One has an average hand: a couple of chumps, a couple of defenders, and a Cram. Not wonderful, not dreadful. I'll try another.\n\nSteward, feint, Gandalf, 2xRivendell Bow, Gondorian Shield. This looks good.\n\n \n\nDeck two has Vilya, some good Lore allies, Hasty Stroke and Miruvor. This is pretty decent, so I'll keep it.\n\n \n\nWe start with Goblin Tunnels and Cave troll. Goblin tunnels is fine, but we'll have to engage that troll turn 2. Fortunately there's a Gandalf about and along with a Feint that should be fine.\n\n \n\nTurn 1:\n\n \n\nDeck one draws a Sneak Attack, perfect! Deck 2 draws Arwen, who will be useful eventually.\n\nTurn 1 is about attachments: Gondorian Shield (Elrond), Rivendell Bow (Elladan), Vilya (Elrond), and Miruvor (Elrond) all go down.\n\nWe have to quest pretty hard, sending in 10\n\n \n\nThe hated Watchful Eyes pops up, which goes on Elladan\n\nPlundered Armoury is the other locations, which we travel to immediately.\n\nEngaging the Troll doesn't seem like a good idea, so Elrond is used for Vilya. This pulls Burning Brand out, very handy!\n\n \n\nTurn 2:\n\n \n\nWe need some Willpower, so I choose to Vilya immediately, and use Miruvor to ready and gain a resource. This brings out Henamarth, which isn't that great, but it's still 1 WP. It also gives enough Spirit resources to play Arwen.\n\nI'd like to put Steward on Elrond, but that would leave no resource for Sneak Attack, and Theodred can't pass a resource to Elrohir this turn, so I have to wait.\n\n \n\n13 Willpower should be enough for the quest, I just have to hope for not too many goblins!\n\n \n\nOrc Horn-blower. Of course. 3 more goblins are revealed. This will not be fun!\n\n \n\nGandalf sneaks in and blows up a Goblin. The Cave-troll is Feinted. Irritatingly, a shadow gets rid of Gandalf. Elladan kills another Goblin.\n\n \n\nState of play: Goblin tunnels and Horn-Blower in staging, Plundered armoury the active location, Cave Troll and Goblins Swordsman engaged with Deck One.\n\n \n\nTurn 3:\n\n \n\nA Black Arrow will help Faramir kill the troll this turn. Steward goes on Elladan: this isn't quite perfect, I'd prefer this on Elrond, but it does allow Elladan to kill lots of goblins and avoid the nasty Watchful Eyes effect, which is more important. A Defender of Rammas will help out too.\n\n \n\nOn the other side, a Master of the Forge appears, pulling Unexpected Courage which goes on Elrond. He will have Defence 5 and immunity to shadow cards and can defend twice. This will cover most attacks.\n\nwillpower is boosted to 12 by Elrond's Counsel.\n\nOut comes a Goblin Scout and a Goblin Spearman. Deck One engages the Spearman.\n\nElrond defends against the Troll and the Swordsman, and the Defender of Rammas stops the Spearman.\n\nFaramir uses the Black Arrow and his 4 attack to join with Elladan to kill the Troll. Elladan then kills the Swordsman.\n\n \n\nState of play: Horn-blower and Scout in staging, Goblin Tunnels the active location, Goblin Spearman engaged with Deck One.\n\n \n\nTurn 4:\n\n \n\nAfter some Runes and Forge shenanigans, Light of Valinor goes on Elladan. Quickbeam emerges, and damages himself. Deck One plays Gondorian Spearman.\n\n \n\nThe Light is immediately discarded to Hidden Threat. Bah! Also, a Goblin Archer comes out, and its defence puts it out of range of Elladan. Double-Bah! At least we explore the Tunnels.\n\n \n\nMay as well engage the Horn-Blower. the attacks are defended successfully, and the Horn-blower and Spearman die easily.\n\n \n\nTurn 5:\n\n \n\nA Squire emerges. The Song of Travel shows up, so finally Theodred's resources might start being used. Master of the Forge finds nothing, and Gleowine is played only to give Deck One another copy of Steward. At least the in-play copy can be discarded if necessary.\n\n \n\nAnother Goblin Tunnels and another Archer. This is very annoying. Hopefully Elladan will get a Rivendell Blade soon.\n\n \n\nThe Scout is killed. Vilya reveals Test of Will. Bah!\n\n \n\nTurn 6\n\n \n\nGandalf shows up to destroy an Archer. Hopefully we can get through the quest this round.\n\n \n\nWe succeed, although another Troll pops up, along with a Scout. Deck 1 engages them both. We can't quite muster enoug to kill the Troll, but we get fairly close.\n\n \n\nTurn 7\n\n \n\nElrond gets another attachment, this time Elven Mail. He can't quest without exhausting any more, though, so questing will be trickier.\n\n \n\nElrohir gets a watchful eyes. Lovely. the other stuff is fairly inconsequential. I kill all enemies I can engage.\n\n \n\nState of play: Goblin Archer and Goblin Tunnels in staging. Plundered Armoury active location. 7 progress on quest. Theats 39 and 37. No enemies engaged. Watchful eyes brings out a Goblin Scout.\n\n \n\nTurn 8\n\n \n\nTime to make a push. Light of Valinor, Gandalf, Naith Guide, Derndingle Warrior, and Miner of the Iron Hills show up. 25 willpower is committed to the quest. Gandalf kills the Scout.\n\n \n\nUndisturbed Bones kills off a couple of pointless characters. Another Watchful Eyes goes on Elrond, but it shouldn't matter. The quest pulls out a Goblin Spearman.\n\n \n\nWith only 4 threat in staging, I win by 21, exploring Plundered armoury and placing 19 progress on the quest and winning the game!\n\n \n\n \n\nROUNDUP:\n\n \n\nElladan and Elrond are the most important parts. Elrohir, Gimli, and Theodred did nothing apart from questing. Faramir once more shows he can be more effective than his reputation suggests, being nice and versatile and usually having 3--4 attack. Deck 1 seems to have too many defensive allies, so some of these should be dropped. Another set of weapons, perhaps Daggers of Westernesse, would have improved the chances of getting Elladan to the important 4 attack that can hit the Archers and the Spearmen. Rivendell Bow wasn't very useful except in the turn where we got swarmed, but this is the most dangerous moment so I think it deserves its place. Errand-Rider would be a good choice, so the Steward can go to one of the brothers and the errand-rider spreads the resources around.\n\n \n\nI was a bit surprised that Deck Two worked so smoothly, but I guess 3 Vilyas, 3 Minstrels, and 1 Song make the chance of getting a Spirit symbol by at least turn 2 quite high. I should probably shuffle the Stewards over to Deck Two, so Theodred has something to do with his resources for more of the game.\n\n \n\nAn interesting thing I didn't notice on creation is that, apart from Faramir and the relatively unnecessary Quickbeam, Deck Two is completely made from the first two cycles of the game!\n\n \n\nAnd finally...\n\n \n\n \n\nQUEST TOO EASY, I PLAY NIGHTMARE!\n\n \n\nI was reminded this is one of the few quests I own a nightmare deck for. I've never played it before, so I thought I'd give it a go, even though I expected to lose quite quickly.

That led to including horn of gondor, and allies such as Galadriel, Gandalf/Sneak attack, vassal of the windlord, etc.\n\nWith two leadership heroes in each deck, I predominantly focused on leadership cards, with cheap cards of from lore/tactics in the other decks.\n\nGiven the absence of spirit, I needed to cover threat reduction and action advantage.\n\nI added Wingfoot for beravor, so that I could quest and still draw cards. I aimed to leave an enemy engaged to so that halbarad could quest, and I added Naith guide to allow some questing without exhausting.\n\nCelebrians stone went on Imrahil, who readied every round with cheap allies being discarded as chump blockers.\n\nI defender with gimli on the first turn, taking four points of damage, to make him the best attacker.\n\n\n\nGiven the number of enemies with low hit points, I included expecting mischief (first time I've ever played that), to kill enemies when they are revealed.\n\n\n\nFor most of the game, I engaged enemies with the halbarad deck, and used faramir to make ranged attacks to help out. I took on two stone giants early on, killing one and leaving the other engaged, gradually building damage on it.\n\nWarden of helm's deep did sentinel duty from the other side of the board, aiding Veteran of Osgiliath in the halbarad deck. At one point I used White Council to ready faramir and add a resource to halbarad, which gave me enough resources to play a second white council to ready gimli, so that faramir and gimli could do a second attack on one round to finish off a second stone giant.\n\n\n\nI progressed quickly to the second part of the quest, and got lucky with the discard (3 baggins resources brought the revealed cards down to three, two of which were treacheries that had no effect at that point). I killed the great goblin the turn he entered play, and then took about three more rounds to quest to victory.\n\n\n\nI didn't keep track of the rounds, but I'd guess it was about 8. Threat was 38 and 43.\n\n\n\nOverall, quite fun. deckbuilding with some predefined constraints is interesting.\n\nEdit: Included quest name in post.\n\nEdited October 11, 2015 by CaffeineAddict"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190886-a-random-walk-to-mordor-1/?do=findComment&comment=1843208","commentId":1843208,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1444510969,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > I choose X, as I don´t own any lord of the rings sagas (but the hobbit ones)and the 3rd and 4th of Angmar awakend.\n> > > \n> > > Then I only could choose the seventh level, which I have played most of all the quests I own (together with A journey along the Anduin, but seventh level is the same danger every time I play it, while Anduin is different).\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > It sounds like 1 might interest you?

Across the Ettenmoors\n\nHeroes: Eomer, Dori, Imrahil, Dunhere, Denethor, Grima\n\n \n\nDeckbuilding thoughts: Seeing Eomer and Imrahil together made me start off focusing on allies leaving play to make use of their abilities.  But Denethor and Dori and built to defend, so chump blocking with allies would waste their defense stats.  Also, Eomer and Imrahil would want to be paired together in a combat deck, but I wanted to pair Eomer and Dunhere to maximize the use of Westfold Horse Breeder and Quick Strike.\n\n \n\nI decided to actually look at the quest to see what I was up against.  The first thing I noticed is that almost all of the enemies have high engagement cost.  There was some doomed, but I thought it would be possible to avoid engaging enemies.  So, I decided to keep some chump blocking allies, but to really focus on making Dunhere a beast.\n\n \n\nDeck 1: Eomer, Dori, Dunhere\n\nThis deck had three purposes: (1) Make Dunhere a monster, (2) Keep threat low, and (3) provide questing allies.  Key cards included Spear of the Mark, Dagger of Westernesse, Galadhrim's Greeting, Secret Vigil, Unexpected Courage, and 2-cost, 2-wp allies.\n\n \n\nDeck 2: Imrahil, Denethor, Grima\n\nThe second deck focused on healing and keeping enemies in the staging area.  Key cards were Warden of Healing, Ranger Spikes, Poisoned Stakes, Dunedain Mark for Dunhere, and sneak attack Gandalf.\n\n \n\nQuest Stage 1\n\nI decided I was going to give it one try only, as long as it wasn't over by the second round.  Luckily, I had a pretty good setup.  The starting side quest was Lie Low, so I avoided the side quests that punish you for spending resources.  The Dunhere deck started with a Spear, a Dagger, and a Horse Breeder, which grabbed Arod.  The lore deck started with Henamarth, a Warden of Healing and Dunedain Mark.  So right off the bat Dunhere was set up to attack the staging area for 8.\n\n \n\nI figured I probably wouldn't have to engage enemies and my willpower was pretty low, so I ended up questing every turn with Eomer, Dori, and Amarthiul.  It took a couple turns to get through Lie Low, but thankfully not too much threat came out.  Henamarth Scouted a Cruel Mountain Troll that I was able to catch in Poisoned Stakes, so he died 5 turns later (with a Secret Vigil attached).  I also caught a Ruthless Hill Troll in Ranger Spikes, effectively neutralizing him.  The combination of Dunhere with Arod and a couple Snowborne Scouts even let me clear a couple locations from the staging area.  By the 4th or 5th turn I cleared my second side quest (Scavenge for Supplies) and advance to stage 2.\n\n \n\nQuest Stage 2\n\nOn this quest stage you need to reveal an extra encounter card unless you are at a safe location.  The good news was that I had 2 safe locations available.  The bad news was that I didn't have enough willpower to quest through those safe locations and make any significant progress on the quest cards.  Forage for Food was one of the side quests, so my heroes kept getting damaged whenever they spent resources.  Make Camp and Lost in the Wilderness came out too, so I was often at 3 side quests and one turn had 4.  Thankfully, Denethor was able to avoid 2 copies of Weight of Responsibility (reveal 1 encounter card per quest).\n\n \n\nI revealed a few Colds from Angmar (damages heroes and blanks text boxes) and Biting Wind (damages questing characters), so I was constantly fighting the damage attrition.  My one Warden of Healing was very busy, and I even had an Honour Guard and Raven Winged Helm on Dori that got used almost every turn.  I felt like I was treading water and my threat was creeping up, but thankfully I was able to use 3 Galadhrim's Greetings and all 3 Secret Vigils (at 3 threat each) to keep both decks in the low 30's.  Eventually the spirit deck got a few questing allies and I was able to power through the rest of the quest stage. \n\n \n\nQuest Stage 3\n\nThe last quest stage was a breeze as I was questing for 20, Dunhere was attacking for 9 with Unexpected Courage, and Denethor was blocking for 6 with sentinel and Burning Brand, although he only had to block once the whole game.  I won at 34 and 30 threat after probably 12-15 turns. \n\n \n\nHighlights\n\n- No allies ever left play, so I never used Eomer or Imrahil's ability.  Imrahil quested every turn and Eomer quested each of the first ~10 turns.\n\n- I was worried about keeping my threat low, so I never used Grima's ability.\n\n- Dori is useless, so I never used his ability except for sentinel for the purposes of playing Raven-Winged Helm.  He contributed his 1 willpower to the quest every turn.\n\n- I only had to block 2 attacks from the low threat, 2 attack enemy.  I knew the shadow card did nothing for the first attack and blocked the second one with burning brand.\n\n- Denethor's ability was amazing, saving me at least 5 additional encounter cards and ensuring my Poisoned Stakes and Ranger Spikes hit prime targets.\n\n- Dunhere killed 5 or 6 trolls from the staging area.  Even with 8+ attack, they each took 2 or 3 swings to kill.\n\n- I actually used Fresh Tracks effectively.  It kept a Ruthless Hill-Troll in the staging area where Dunhere could kill him.\n\n- I was able to drop a combined 38 threat with 3x Galadhrim's Greeting and Secret Vigil and 2.\n\n \n\nThanks for the challenge!  It made me think outside the box a bit.  I was mostly just amused that I was questing with Eomer and Dori every turn and I wasn't using any of my heroes' abilities besides Dunhere and Denethor.\n\nEdited October 11, 2015 by

The idea was simple: quest as much as possible with Trisphere, set Elrohir as a main defender, kill everything in sight with MonoT. Then, in some forgotten corner of Cardgamedb deckbuilder I stumbled upon something called MTNA and the fun began; it was MonoTacticsNoAllies, Hama based deck built sometime around Druadan Forest premiere and not played once, I suppose.\n\nSo I took it and updated a little bit.\n\n \n\nSome stretching at Normal level showed that lack of Ranged hero on the red side might seriously slow down killing, so I took out Quick Strikes, Swift Strikes and Close Calls in favor of Legolas ally, Arod and Hands Upon the Bow x3. Now it is MonoTacticsAlmostNoAllies deck and it's quite funny. OK, it's crazy funny; except for the moments when your hand consists of second copy of Captain of Gondor, 2xGondorian Disciplne, 1xHUtB and there's no Legolas around.\n\n \n\nTrisphere required some resource management to pay for all those cheap spirit allies and I sticked to the simplest of solutions by shoving Song of Travel on Faramir whenever it appeared.\n\n \n\nI played the quest ten times, tweaking decks a little on the fly. Here's how it went:\n\n \n\n1. Onsight win! Score 170. At least that's what the notes say, don't remember any details.\n\n \n\n2. Lost due to threat. Balin's doom that surged into Western Hall in round 10. Combo of Pit Goblin + Deep Mines + Western Hall is sneaky good; one is mostly happy with encounter of non-surging enemies and locations when playing Nightmare. Not in this case. And that doesn't even take into concern the possibility of Taskmaster lurking around.\n\n \n\n3. Won in twelve rounds. 171.\n\n \n\nHello Encounter Deck, taste my combo for a change! Devastatingly good things happen when Legolas kills something with his toys. Draw a card, progress on location, progress on quest. Bazinga!\n\n \n\n4. Two Pit Goblins, Taskmaster and Western Hall (among others) with nothing to reliably counter with. Tactics got 48 threat at the beginning of round three, enough said. LOST!\n\n \n\n5. Won in twelve rounds, 223. Tactics threated out, but I got lucky at the engagement draw and somehow quested for the win last two rounds. This one showed most of the soft spots that these decks have; Song of Travel showed up at round 10, so I ended the game with 14 spirit cards on hand; Double Back was drawn at the beginning of round twelve; Elrohir got sentinel about round 6, which forced me to block with Boromir and that didn't exactly help with Tactics' threat woes. I might deserve some permanent Grievous Wound for that kind of win.\n\n \n\n6. Watch out man, that will be a cakewalk! Tri-sphere's starting hand contains LoV, Song Of Travel, Gandalf and Campfire Tales, let's see… Nope. Conceeded at round four due to rules error – I did not add resources on Goblins in proper manner. Just another way to suffer a loss.\n\n \n\n7. This one showed that there's a lot of relativity in „good starting hand” concept. There was nothing particularly interesting in the beginning besides Elven Mail and Song of Travel, but I won in round 13, score 185.\n\n \n\nTactics guys tend to pile up resources and dead cards. I adressed the cards by adding Protector of Lorien to the Trisphere deck with Elladan being the beneficiary, since his duty is mainly questing. Resources might be good fodder for Gondorian Fire or some Envoy tricks, but I'm not ready for breaking the „Almost No Allies” rule. By the way, Sword-Thain for Legolas would be bonkers good.\n\n \n\n8. Elrohir died at round five due to ill-timed shadow effect and Western Hall in staging area pretty much guaranteed that my lousy willpower didn't stand a chance. Side note: no shadow effect is „well-timed” when defending hero has 1 life remaining.\n\n \n\n9. That one has Lynch-like start: two Taskmasters, then oh so predictable Troll among two Pit Goblins. No success of course, Elrohir and Boromir died at round 4.\n\n \n\n10. Not-so-epic, but WIN nevertheless. 12 rounds, score 188. It was rather escape through some rathole than stomping over mutilated bodies of enemies since there were six enemies alive and kicking engaged and in staging, but a win is a win. I expected a much better score this time, but resources piled up a little on Goblins due to Chamber of Records effect, the Taskmaster came to visit along with his old pal Cave Troll, so it took some time.\n\n \n\n \n\n5 lost, 5 won, enormous amount of fun.

(it was previously damaged)  All enemies have been defeated and there is enough progress on Stage 4B for completion so victory was accomplished!  Ending threat was 47 and 33.\n\n \n\nConclusion: This scenario was really fun and I got to use some new cards I had never used (Dunedain Hunter mainly).  Not only did he prove to be extremely useful, but he made me realize the power of pulling large threats out of the deck when you choose to versus being surprised by them when you are unable to deal with them.  It seems Forest Snare and Dunedain Hunter go hand and hand and I was quite surprised at how well it worked because I figured I would not draw one of the two.  I did seem to get lucky by drawing all three of my Dunedain Hunters but I really did not expect to see Attercop, Attercop the third time I played my Dunedain Hunter despite how funny I thought it was.\n\nEdited October 12, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190886-a-random-walk-to-mordor-1/?do=findComment&comment=1851494","commentId":1851494,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1445012311,"content":">  \n\n \n\nWow, 10 attempts!

I think if they ever release a tactics attachment that works well with Bard for 1 cost (or maybe even 2) his usefulness in certain scenarios will trump Legolas'.  Right now, the reason he lacks usefulness is because of a lack of useful attachments for him.  Imagine if he had an attachment that was for him like Firefoot/Eomer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190886-a-random-walk-to-mordor-1/?do=findComment&comment=1852762","commentId":1852762,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1445086815,"content":"I find that if you are running a tactics deck then you are going to want lots of weapons anyway for stuff like Foe-hammer and Goblin Cleaver.

Turns out I never ended up using that synergy after all.\n\n \n\nDeckbuilding\n\nMy first attempt was to build a Dwarf Swarm deck. I figured Erestor would help me get through my deck to get all of those dwarves into play quickly. In practice, however, I wasn't loving the low willpower and attack available from the cheaper Lore dwarves, and the Leadership dwarves were a bit too expensive. Plus, it took too long to get to 5 dwarves and I didn't need the card draw that the dwarf cards offered.\n\n \n\nSo I scrapped that, and decided to focus a little more on traps for the many weak enemies in the scenario. I knew I needed some sort of resource acceleration, but I wanted to see if I could use Master of Lore to help pay for things instead of Steward of Gondor. After I finished building, I realized that I wasn't really using my Leadership resources for much, so I just dropped some Song of Wisdom in and used Leadership as a splash colour instead.\n\n \n\nThis was the result:\n\nTotal Cards: (57)\n\nHero: (3)\n\n1x Erestor (The Treachery of Rhudaur) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/angmar-awakened-cycle/the-treachery-of-rhudaur/erestor-r1629]\n\n1x Balin (On the Doorstep) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/on-the-doorstep/balin-otd]\n\n1x Glorfindel (Core Set) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/glorfindel-core]\n\n \n\nAlly: (27)\n\n2x Gildor Inglorion (The Hills of Emyn Muil) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/the-hills-of-emyn-muil/gildor-inglorion-thoem]\n\n2x Galdor of the Havens (The Treachery of Rhudaur) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/angmar-awakened-cycle/the-treachery-of-rhudaur/galdor-of-the-havens-r1636]\n\n3x Ered Nimrais Prospector (The Morgul Vale) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/the-morgul-vale/ered-nimrais-prospector-tmv]\n\n3x Elrond (The Road Darkens) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-road-darkens/elrond-r1208]\n\n3x Erebor Hammersmith (Core Set) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/erebor-hammersmith-core]\n\n2x Quickbeam (The Treason of Saruman) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-treason-of-saruman/quickbeam-r1452]\n\n3x Master of Lore (Heirs of Numenor) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/heirs-of-numenor/master-of-lore-hon]\n\n2x Anborn (The Blood of Gondor) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/the-blood-of-gondor/anborn-tbog]\n\n2x Henamarth Riversong (Core Set) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/henamarth-riversong-core]\n\n2x Mablung (The Land of Shadow) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-land-of-shadow/mablung-r1588]\n\n3x Mirkwood Runner (Return to Mirkwood) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/return-to-mirkwood/mirkwood-runner-rtm]\n\n \n\nAttachment: (24)\n\n3x Song of Wisdom (Conflict at the Carrock) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/conflict-at-the-carrock/song-of-wisdom-catc]\n\n3x Cram (Over Hill and Under Hill) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/over-hill-and-under-hill/cram-ohauh]\n\n3x Thror's Map (Over Hill and Under Hill) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/over-hill-and-under-hill/thrors-map-ohauh]\n\n3x Protector of Lorien (Core Set) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/protector-of-lorien-core]\n\n3x Lembas (Trouble in Tharbad) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/trouble-in-tharbad/lembas-r1186]\n\n3x Ambush (The Land of Shadow) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-land-of-shadow/ambush-r1592]\n\n3x Ranger Spikes (Heirs of Numenor) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/heirs-of-numenor/ranger-spikes-hon]\n\n3x Poisoned Stakes (The Blood of Gondor) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/the-blood-of-gondor/poisoned-stakes-tbog]\n\n \n\nEvent: (6)\n\n3x Ancestral Knowledge (Khazad-dum) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/ancestral-knowledge-kd]\n\n3x Expecting Mischief (Over Hill and Under Hill) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/over-hill-and-under-hill/expecting-mischief-ohauh]\n\n \n\nSide Quest: (0)\n\n \n\n \n\nPlay Report\n\nThe mulligan card is Song of Wisdom--the sooner I can start using Balin's resources, the better. From my first hand, I played Protector of Lorien on Erestor, Song of Wisdom on Balin, and Thror's Map on Glorfindel. That was a great starting hand, because it set me up for victory the rest of the game.\n\n \n\nThis scenario is pretty location-heavy, and the gimmick with many of the locations is that they have rough Travel abilities. Thror's Map does away with that problem almost entirely.\n\n \n\nErestor would play the role of both quester and defender, so the first Cram/Lembas went on him in case he needed to do both. Most turns I could play one or two cards and then drop the rest to Protector of Lorien to boost Erestor's willpower.\n\n \n\nMy Turn 1 encounter card was Zigil Mineshaft [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Zigil-Mineshaft-KD]. Combined with the Branching Paths [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Branching-Paths-KD] already in the staging area from Setup, I was looking at 8 threat in the staging area and already worried about location lock, so I used the Cave Torch [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Cave-Torch-KD] and raised my threat by 2 (per Zigil Mineshaft's Action) to clear the Mineshaft immediately.\n\n \n\nTurn 2 I got down a Master of Lore, but I ended up sending him on the quest for a few rounds because I didn't want to lose a hero to Sudden Pitfall [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Sudden-Pitfall-KD]. The encounter card was another location.\n\n \n\nTurn 3 I put down Ambush and got my first enemy of the game, a Goblin Scout [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Goblin-Scout-KD]. I had held back Glorfindel, so I used him to dispatch the enemy before it could attack.\n\n \n\nTurn 4 I got my first ally since Master of Lore, an Erebor Hammersmith. Finally I could use Master of Lore as a cost reducer instead of Sudden Pitfall insurance! Good timing, too, because the encounter reveal that turn was indeed a Sudden Pitfall, discarding the poor Hammersmith before he even got to make a contribution to the quest. But there is only one copy of Sudden Pitfall in the encounter deck, so from that point onward I was safe to quest with my heroes alone.\n\n \n\nFrom there on out, I was able to get at least one ally down each round, and trap all enemies so that I could either ignore them or kill them before they had a chance to attack. I had no trouble focusing most of my efforts on clearing locations and quests, and I cleared the first two stages on Turn 7, and then quested through stage 3 to victory the next turn.\n\n \n\n8 turns\n\n43 threat\n\n0 damage on heroes\n\n0 dead heroes\n\n4 victory points\n\nFinal Score: 119\n\n \n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI really enjoyed using Master of Lore in conjunction with Erestor--with a single Master of Lore in play for most of the game, I was able to get down either a 4-cost card or two 2-cost cards each round, and then dump the other two to Protector of Lorien. It worked really well, and felt more native than Steward of Gondor.\n\n \n\nIt's been a while since I played Into The Pit, but I have found that the Cave Torch provided plenty of location control on its own. Early incarnations of this deck included Asfaloth, and while I could get some use out of him, I discovered that he really wasn't worth the resource cost--the Cave Torch took care of the nastiest locations on its own.\n\n \n\nThror's Map was definitely MVP of this game. The locations in this quest lose a lot of their bite when you can completely ignore their travel effects.\n\n \n\nThanks for arranging this Seastan!

Notes on my attempt to beat Peril in Pelargir with Tactigorn + Erkenbrand + Eleanor and Elrond + Haldir + Bombur. TL;DR: Discarding hand first turn leads to loss. Much cursing all around. Everyone blames Bombur.\n\n \n\n \n\nTurn 1. Started off strong. Even with enough pints in him to glow (LoV), Elrond was killing it at the Leaping Fish's trivia night: dropping references to ancient runes, deep knowledge, etc. like there was no tomorrow. Haldir was performing knife tricks with a (rivendell) blade he won off of Aragorn at dice -- the dunedain practically fell off his stool when snake-eyes came up, mouthing something about a \"gift from Arwen\". Erkenbrand and Eleanor were off in a dark corner, but even they noticed when Quickbeam strolled in to challenge Bombur to a drink-off. The fat dwarf quaffed beer so fast it was running down his beard, but he had found a scroll lying around to mop up the mess with. Unfortunately, it turned out the scroll might not have been the best choice of napkin, for a thuggish patron jumped him as he was draining his 3rd pint. The initial collateral damage was limited to a few broken bottles, but Elrond got dragged in when a second thug grabbed him by the pointy ears. The elf-lord was undismayed, and reached into his bag of tricks only to find that it had gotten lost in the city somewhere. [Note: discarding my lore deck's hand of 8 cards on the first turn to that shadow effect pretty much ended the game right there, but I pressed on for a while]. \"Dammit, Bombur,\" he bellowed, \"What'd you do with the bag of tricks?!\". \"I dinnae know where yer bag of tricks is,\" yelled back the double-sized dwarf,  \"ye had it at…\" but his reply was cut short by a bar stool to the back of the head. He dropped the scroll, and the smug thug grabbed it up, only to meet an unsmiling Haldir. Meanwhile, Eleanor lost her purse to a pickpocket in the tumult. Erkenbrand promptly threw him out the window, but the purse went too…\n\n \n\n \n\nTurn 2. Elrond helps Bombur to his feet. He's dazed, and blood mixes with beer in his braids, but he stands his ground. An errand rider arrives with a note for Eleanor (raising a grumble from Erkenbrand), as Aragorn and Quickbeam work on some crowd control. Eleanor spotted an entrance to the storehouse, and made her way to it looking for a way out of the rapidly degenerating pub. All might have been fine but for the barkeep turning traitor — he lunged at Eleanor, though thankfully cloaked figure — likely a veteran of Ithilien — spotted the move and tripped him. The lord of the Westfold slugged him a good him, and bloodied the zealous barkeep's nose. Haldir, stone-cold, mowed down another thug. Bombur picked up the bloodied scroll. \"That's my napkin,\" he bellowed, \"ye cannae have it!\"\n\n \n\n \n\nTurn 3. A second rider brings a note to Eleanor, bringing a blush to her cheeks. Erkenbrand, red with jealousy, downs a bottle he found rolling across the floor. \"If that were a gentleman what wrote that note,\" he roared, \"then I'm the steward of Gondor!\" Aragorn shot him a dark look, and the horselord trailed off at the dunedain's warning, collecting some of his composure back. Hennemarth Riverson appeared at Elrond's side, \"ready to serve, my lord\". \"Did you find my bag of tricks?\", asked Elrond. \"Well, no, but I did spot another pickpocket!\". \"…thanks.\" Aragorn and Quickbeam are still keeping the holding off the crowd, when Bombur remembers that Elrond left the bag of tricks back in the market square. \"Son of a…,\" mutters Elrond. \"That's halfway across the city!\" The dwarf shrugs, causing the pickpocket to grab a roll of fat rather than Bombur's coinpurse. Meanwhile, Haldir pulls off a hat-trick, dispatching the turncoat bartender as he grapples with Erkenbrand.\n\n \n\n \n\nTurn 4. Bombur makes his own medicine as he downs another pint, \"'tis good for me self preservashun,\" he slurs. Though his eyes point two different directions, he seems to stand more firmly. \"Bombur, you fat fool!\" shouts Bofur, bursting into the bar. \"It's your drinkin' that's the cause of this ruckus. Looks like I'll have to clean up yer mess again.\" Aragorn, feeling the need for a bit more dramatic emphasis to keep more of the crowd from joining the fight, draws out his sword. \"Fat lot of good half a blade's gonna do!,\" shouts Erkenbrand. \"This here's a battle brawl, not some pansy queen's rules fisticuffs!\". Eleanor's diplomacy does more to avert local trouble than either of the two men's blustering, but even her charms can't deter a cloaked figure with a crossbow, determined to seek revenge for the barkeep and reclaim the napkin. He fires away, maiming both errand boys and thrusting a dagger into Aragorn's thigh. Amid the confusion, he snatches the napkin from a now cross-eyed Bombur and rushes for the door! Elrond makes a stand over the stricken strider, his elven mail flashing in the torchlight as he faces the assassin's blades. The elf-lord takes a slicing before Erkenbrand and Haldir rush the assassin from both sides, ending his spree of bloodshed. But the napkin has disappeared again…\n\n \n\n \n\nTurn 5. \"Haven't we got any options here?!,\" screams Elrond. \"Where's our backup?\" Hennemarth does a little jig to cheer his lord, but Elrond's already seen the shtick and is not amused. [Note: drawing second copies of Quickbeam and Hennemarth really put the nail in the coffin — pretty much anything else, literally anything else, might have given me the edge to pull through. But combined with a handful of sneak attacks and no allies for the tri-sphere deck, I was running low on plays.] An endless string of thugs seems to be pouring into the bar, and the kitchenboy turns traitor just like his former employer. Elrond, Bombur, and Erkenbrand engage, but Haldir can't work his blade fast enough. In the chaos, Eleanor catches sight of the scroll, and nabbing it from under an overturned table she flees into the street.\n\n \n\n \n\nTurn 6. No help is on the horizon, just another errand rider with a note for Eleanor. \"**** your notes, woman!\" shouts Erkenbrand, \"Where's that grey wizard when you need him?\". We need to gather our wits and information, decides Aragorn (admittedly not the brightest bulb in the bunch, bringing a broken sword to a bar brawl, after all). But another thug steps out of the shadows as the mostly-drunk heroes rush blindly into the City Street. The thug and traitorous kitchen boy emerge behind them. Just then, a bandit drops down from the roof overhead, striking out at Elrond. An evil power must have guided his blow, for the knife went through all the elf-lord's defenses, even his elven mail. As Elrond's life-blood poured out on the pavement, and the light of valinor faded from his eyes, Eleanor wept. \"Have the napkin!,\" she shrieked, throwing it at the nearest thug. \"We give up!\" Kneeling over the stricken elf, Aragorn leans close to hear his final words. \"Tell Arwen… she's too good.. for you… …and.. Haldir… cheats… dice…….\" Turning his face to the heavens, fists clenched in helpless rage, Aragorn lets loose a primal roar, \"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!\"  Bombur belches, and passes out. \"Game over, man\" moans Haldir, \"Game over\". \n\nEdited October 18, 2015 by Kjeld"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190886-a-random-walk-to-mordor-1/?do=findComment&comment=1854214","commentId":1854214,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1445212694,"content":">  \n\n \n\nAmazing.

So what if Dwalin is, um, Dwalin? Against Journey Down the Anduin, the only thing that made me hesitate was the total starting threat cost of 62... Thus, at least one deck would have to start >=30 and, in the absence of shenanigans, would be forced to engage that old friend, the Hill Troll.\n\n \nRather than going all in with first-turn threat reduction, I decided that just one-shotting the Hill Troll would be the way to go. I had four different heroes with a native 3ATK, after all, one of whom was ranged. Plus, I had a lot of cheap options for 3 additional ATK on the first turn, including: Vassal of the Windlord, Fair and Perilous (on Lorefindel), Khazad! Khazad! (on, gasp, Dwalin). In retrospect, I could've thrown in Unseen Strike to up the chances even more.\n \nI split my heroes into Gandalf/Lorefindel/Frodo and Idraen/Dwalin/Legolas. I was fortunate enough to initially draw Shadowfax -- so Gandalf could both defend and attack the Hill Troll, even from the other side of the table -- a Rivendell Blade for Legolas, AND Khazad! Khazad! for Dwalin. I didn't even need all that because the quest setup included a Brown Lands, whose self-annihilating effect guaranteed that Idraen would quest yet be ready by the combat phase. I almost felt bad for the Hill Troll. Almost.\n \nAncient Mathom got Asfaloth into my hand before turn 1 was over (thanks again, Brown Lands), I managed to get several cheap, high-willpower allies into play early, and the encounter deck was kind throughout... No Necromancer's Reach, no second Hill Troll, and a pair of Banks of the Anduin locations helped me to know I could take attacks from the weak enemies undefended.\n\n\nI was pretty happy that something about every hero proved useful -- most of the native abilities were used, excepting Dwalin's (who nevertheless proved useful just being a Dwarf target for Khazad! Khazad!) and Lorefindel's (who never really had a suitable target for healing, but who still served as Asfaloth's rider; yay in-faction Glorfindel).\n \nOverall, the luck of the draw made the win a cakewalk. To up the challenge, I then threw together the heroes in a different combo (high-threat Gandalf/Lorefindel/Legolas and mono-Spirit Idraen/Frodo/Dwalin) and promptly got my butt handed to me.

(Bardo el Arquero) II          Aragorn (Le)    Galadriel       Boromir (Ta)    Bilbo Baggins   Dwalin          Balin\n> \n>  \n\n \n\n \nOn the fall of 2013, three friends and I started a campaign at work, and it just so happens that we are in the middle of our third try at Into Ithilien, so I'm happy, in a masochistic kind of way, to jump at this adventure.\n \nLooking at the choice of heroes, this looks like the perfect opportunity to using Boromir and Galadriel as the main strategy and perhaps make Brandon from the COTR podcast proud!\n \nThe main deck is made up with Boromir, Galadriel and Dwalin. The main purpose of this deck is to equip Boromir with a Gondorian Shield and Blood of Numenor to boost his defence, and Gondorian Fire to boost his attack. The tried-and-true Imladris Stargazer and Zigil Miner partnership will help pile resources on Boromir. Almost as important as boosting Boromir, we will try to counter the nasty, nasty treacheries on this quest with Test of Will. Feint is always great and since we have dwarf heroes Khazad! Khazad! giving +3 to battle questing it ought to be very useful, as is Vassal of the Windlord. Elrond's Counsel, Galadhrim's Greeting and Secret Vigil will hopefully counteract the threat incurred by using Boromir.  Finally, Nenya and some  allies are there to help with the willpower questing, if we manage to keep Celador alive!\n \nThe second deck is composed by Aragorn, Balin and Bilbo. The focus for this deck is to  support Boromir by providing resources with Steward of Gondor, The Day's Rising, Envoy of Pelargir and Errand Rider. Faramir, Visionary Leadership and a host of Gondor allies should prove useful if we get to do willpower questing. Bilbo will use a Good Meal for Lorien's Wealth and Gildor's Counsel. \n \nNow let's see how I fared.\n \nThe first game started  in a very promising way. I made the questionable play of using Sneak Attack Gandalf on the planning phase to draw cards, but hey, I could sneak attack Gandalf again on the questing phase. Everybody was committed to the quest to ensure that the Ithilien Road would be fully explored, but an enemy was revealed followed by Watcher in the Wood, which means that, as I had failed to draw a Test of Will, I have to raise the threat of both hands by nine. I concede the game since all enemies engage, and it is impossible to avoid at least one dead hero.\n \nOn the second attempt I survived the first turn and it was looking like Boromir was going to get fully set up.  But then I took the bad decision on turn three to spare some damage to Boromir and defend an attack with Balin. Of course a Southron Mercenaries show up as the shadow and the +3 attack kills Balin.\n \nAs Bilbo's father used to say 'third time pays for all'. I was finally able to beat the quest, but it was though. It took eight rounds and during the first four I was constantly on the edge of the abyss. An overworked Warden of Healing could barely keep the heroes alive. I was lucky to avoid treacheries and having Test of Will when did show up. It was not until the sixth turn that I was able to complete the first quest, but I did manage to keep Celador alive. By the time I made it to the final quest, my threat was so high on both hands that it was siege questing, but that turned out to be for the better. Boromir with Blood of Numenor can siege quest like there is no tomorrow. The Gondor allies never materialized except for the Warden of Healing which proved indispensable.\n \nThis adventure is a real challenge. There is a lot tension as each card is revealed during the quest phase.\n \nNotwithstanding this victory, this adventure will continue to preoccupy me until my friends and I finally beat at work. There I'm playing a deck with a murderous Dunhere that has been proving very effective. We are doing very well at the point where we paused the game and I have a Test of Will at hand which gives me hope for the subsequent turn. But I still fear the one-two punch of Southron Support and Watcher n the Wood.\n \narwtm_into_ithilien.png [http://s15.postimg.org/kd4lui82h/arwtm_into_ithilien.png]\n \nHero\n1x Galadriel\n1x Dwalin\n1x Boromir\n \nAlly\n2x Arwen Undómiel\n3x Vassal of the Windlord\n1x Honour Guard\n3x Galadriel's Handmaiden\n3x Imladris Stargazer\n3x Ethir Swordsman\n3x Zigil Miner\n \nAttachment\n3x Gondorian Fire\n3x Blood of Númenor\n2x Gondorian Shield\n3x Secret Vigil\n1x Nenya\n3x Mirror of Galadriel\n2x Silver Harp\n \nEvent\n3x Elrond's Counsel\n3x A Test of Will\n3x The Galadhrim's Greeting\n3x Khazâd!

The high wp of Glorfindel is invaluable, both for attack and quest. Frodo will be a ecxellent blocker together with Loragorn. Brand will be able to ready Glorfindel, which is very good.\n\nHaldir and Brand will both (of course) go in the same deck, and Loragorn together with Frodo in the other. Glorfindels three wp needs to be in the combat deck. Loragorn, Glorfindel and Frodo will be the engaging-deck and Haldir, Brand and Idraen will be the support.\n\n \n\nSome rare cards used;\n\nCurius Brandybuck - Two attack the first round and two willpower next round (but discarded after that) for free. Very good.\n\nLongbeard map-maker - Will allow exactly the wp needed to kill an enemy or explore a location.\n\nProtector of Lorien - not rare but even more powerful in this quest.\n\nGildors counsel - awesome in two handed/two player.\n\nStar Brooch - atk when engaged with an enemy? Good.\n\nStraight shot - the unded have a very low defense.\n\n \n\nTurn one:\n\nAsfaloth, Rivendell blade and Fast hich played. The blackroot graves was successfully explored.\n\n \n\nTurn two:\n\nArwen, Wandering ent and Light of Valinor (a key card to Glorfindel) entered play during planning. The Company explored more Blackroot Graves and Tarlags neck. The whole quest stage was defeated, together with a Whisperer and a Restless dead. Defruin joined the party.\n\n \n\nTurn three:\n\nAfter a skipped planning phase, a third blackroot graves got explored, together with the Stone of Erech.\n\n \n\nTurn four:\nAfter getting no resources, lembas, protector of lorien, ranger spikes and a Gondorian Spearman was played. The encounter deck hurried on to dusk, a vale of shadows was explored and the quest advanced. Soon after the lord appeared, he also died by a sword hit from Glorfindel, the protector of lorien. A shadow man was also killd by the elf-lord, but the brave Gondorian Sperman died a noble Death.\n\n \n\nTurn five:\n\nGandalf and an swordsman from Ethir entered play. Glorfindel actually used his ability and healed Aragorn.\n\nThe dead rode behind me, and that became the fate of the wandering ent and the sworsman from Ethir.\n\nThe last quest stage was explored and I won with one progress on dusk.\n\n \n\nScore:\n\n29 + 31 threat\n\n0 dead hero threat cost\n\n6 damage (due to that last treachery)\n\n40 round points (four compleated rounds)\n\n6victory ponts\n\nTotal: 100!\n\n \n\nIt was not so hard, and the decks managed every aspect of the game good. The star in the game was, as always, Glorfindel (but the rarely used lore version). This really proving the fact that Glorfindel (lore version) is a very good hero.\n\nEdited November 8, 2015 by DurinVoronwe"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190886-a-random-walk-to-mordor-1/?do=findComment&comment=1886463","commentId":1886463,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1447089154,"content":"DurinVoronwe, thanks for the write up!
