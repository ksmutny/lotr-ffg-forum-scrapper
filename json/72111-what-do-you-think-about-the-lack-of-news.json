And then September came along and beat the record -- because that month only had 2 items.\n\nEven the French site is getting more news than us, because apparently they've had some stuff about the new cycle ages ago, which we haven't got on ours yet.\n\nI really miss the news, because it gives the people on this forum (and BGG too) something to talk about. We can't speculate on much anymore, other than the few cards that we've known about for ages.\n\nI think FFG are missing a trick by drying up the news, especially when there's some new boxes in the pipeline, because it keeps the interest up. maybe they spoiled us in the past, and this is the normal amount that we should expect. Maybe we should compare how much news we get with what the other games go. I'm pretty sure that older games like Call of Cthulu and Game of Thrones get loads more\n\n \n\n[PS… last time i asked about the news they posted a load more straight away about the new cycle, so im hoping that im going to jinx them into doing that again!]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72111-what-do-you-think-about-the-lack-of-news/?do=findComment&comment=703830","commentId":703830,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1349192140,"content":"i dont think it means anything- ive watched the news waver and steady since the game came out last year. i think they just have alot of things to do and not many people to do it\n\ni do think news is important though- as you say it gets people here…..i mean the news of the numenor (the battles one) got hardly any talk going, compared to the khazad and so on which talk went of for ages\n\nstill its annoying, as i put so much time and love into this game- actually last time i started pretending to cry a preview came up …..so here it is\n\nllorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]\n\nrich\n\nPS- just noticed your Ps- great minds think alike haha\n\nPPS- little hint if you want news- search in fantasy flight games hiers of numenor….theres some unreleased artwork lying about here and there"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72111-what-do-you-think-about-the-lack-of-news/?do=findComment&comment=703845","commentId":703845,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1349193888,"content":"It is better not to compare with the other games, unless one is ready to get angry, it is often hard to find a preview for this game on the news list.

I think we're averaging (unscientifically) 5-15 replies per spoiled keyword. Archery got very little talk. Battlegrounds and Siege also were largely ignored. In my recent update of the (SPOILERS) thread I've added all of the text to the known cards, with some inferred phrases as well. One surprise for me in that exercise was seeing all of the new keywords and card interactions. For example. If you explore The Citadel, an 11 point Battleground location soon enough, you remove a stage 4 from the quest deck. That's so cool and yet I haven't read anyone commenting on it. Then there's the whole Battleground mechanic where enemies damage locations and if the locations are destroyed you can't explore them or claim the victory points. I also saw on stage 2B of Siege of Cair Andros that there might be a new \"sieging\" stage in each round (for certain quests). Now that was very small print in an out of focus, digital photograph, but if that is actually the case, the designers have added a whole new stage to each round. That's HUGE (IMHO).\n\nSo my point is a lot is going on already, and we are basically ignoring it. I'm certainly to blame as my schedule has picked up so I'm posting less, and maybe we all just want more big and clear pictures of spoiled cards and mini-commentaries from Caleb. I imagine as October drags on we'll get some previews of The Hobbit II and HoN. Apparently Christian Petersen said the one will be out 1 month and a half or so after the other, so if they both hit this year, one must be out by mid-November at the latest (barring shipping problems).\n\nOn a semi-related topic, I think Heirs of Numenor must include some additional tokens (or maybe stickers a la choppic) since we need to keep track of damage on locations now, and so many quest stages/locations are over 10 points."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72111-what-do-you-think-about-the-lack-of-news/?do=findComment&comment=703862","commentId":703862,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1349195047,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nPPS- little hint if you want news- search in fantasy flight games hiers of numenor….theres some unreleased artwork lying about here and there\n\n\n\nI just saw a gorgeous pic of the harbor at Pelargir and a rather frightening Orc camp (or something like that).
