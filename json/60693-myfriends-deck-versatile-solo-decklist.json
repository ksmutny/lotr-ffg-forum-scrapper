Thanks for your great opinion! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nNarvi's Belt, Parting Gifts, Theodred give you a total control on resources. I think that removing Parting Gifts with 2 leadership and on legolas for tacticts, you may suffer resources leak...\n\nbooored said:\n\nMy only real thing about his deck is that it is so attack heavy.

I see only now that there is an error: on the list miss Faramir (How edit my starting post? I attache the updated list below). Only the first turn you suffer a only 3-willpower, then with Dain willpower boost of dwarfs, Faramir boost and Legolas power... On the 8th-9th turn you quest for  10-12.\n\nYes, maybe I should think about Gondelin...\n\nbooored said:\n\nThis deck looks fun, I rarely play aggressive decks and probably should to change it up a bit but at first glance, (with no play though) I would say.. dump out Decendant.. a 4 drop (expensive).. only effects stuff in the staging area (lame) and it has to leave play to activate.

I am just not seeing this.\n\n\n\nI can assure that with low threat starting (28) and Gandalf  help you can get rid of threat increase.
