It feels like it's adding a subdued gloss to the image. Feels tangible and and soft, which is a neat take on a gruff dwarf. Digging it, man.  Also, I like how you left the exterior uniformly washed out, but the colors and definition still exists.

Middle Earth is a daunting topic to work on for any illustrator (even though, at the same time, many of us hear its siren's call) because one ends in the same arena as some of the greatest masters in the genre.\n\nIn Thorin's style I can only bow and say 'at your service and your clan's'.\n\nEchtalion, it is a digital piece, usually, once the sketch is defined and refined, I block in the colors (already with a base of mass and lightting) in Painter, and then go on with the refining in Photoshop. I find that the mimicking of traditional media of Painter (I usually go for artist's oils)  helps to avoid the plastic-like feeling that is the curse of not few digital works."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33831-thorin-oakenshields-art/?do=findComment&comment=349401","commentId":349401,"userName":"jgt7771","timestamp":1282841223,"content":"Oh good lord, that's GORGEOUS!  The way you do skin tone and texture is AMAZING.  LOVE that BLUE.\n\nYou did the \"Drunken Hallucinations\" for Call of Cthulhu, didn't you?  That was equally awesome (and delightfully strange).  Did you get to draw any Lord of the Rings creatures?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33831-thorin-oakenshields-art/?do=findComment&comment=362713","commentId":362713,"userName":"alex.nem.","timestamp":1285253598,"content":"Yes, typic american work, i 'am sorry - it seems to be very far from Tolkiens world."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33831-thorin-oakenshields-art/?do=findComment&comment=362839","commentId":362839,"userName":"Hates_End","timestamp":1285269953,"content":"alex.nem. said:\n\nYes, typic american work, i 'am sorry - it seems to be very far from Tolkiens world.\n\n\n\nI'm sorry - are you J.R.R. himself?  If not, keep comments like that to yourself or preface it with stuff like \"imo just doesn't seem like ...\"\n\n~"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33831-thorin-oakenshields-art/?do=findComment&comment=363979","commentId":363979,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1285434189,"content":"alex.nem. said:\n\nYes, typic american work, i 'am sorry - it seems to be very far from Tolkiens world.\n\n\n\nI don't know what that means.
