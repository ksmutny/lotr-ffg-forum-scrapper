Homebrewed cards are flying around the internet naturally but I for one would never play any - including my own (of which I only made two); but I would like to share this thought and thought behind it. If the game (or the world) does not collapse soon (which I hope it shall not) Asfaloth will see the light of day sooner or later. I just hope it is something along these lines.\n\nAsfaloth, unique Leadership attachment cost 2\n\nHorse.\n\nAttach to a Noldor or Silvan character. Attached character can have no more than one Horse attached.\n\nAttached character does not exhaust to comit to the quest.\n\nIf attached character is Glorfindel, it gains \"Action: exhaust Asfaloth to choose a character. That characters gets +1 willpower or +1 attack (choose 1) until the end of the phase.\n\nI believe the usual downfall of homebrewed cards is that they are often overpowered. Let's compare Asfaloth to Unexpected Courage, same cost in a different sphere, unique and more \"restricted\", lot weaker in function unless it is Glorfindel. So it is certainly not overpowered but neither it is useless for heroes like Elladan or Elrohir, and since it comes in different sphere, it gives a detour option. That Glorfindel's bonus should represent the theme of aiding others, like Frodo Baggins.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64425-asfaloth-one-card-i-would-like-to-see-made-this-way-edit-is-asfaloth-coming-as-the-new-mount/?do=findComment&comment=629671","commentId":629671,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1336747621,"content":"Why on earth would you make it a Leadership card, leaving Glorfindel himself unable to play it sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif] ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64425-asfaloth-one-card-i-would-like-to-see-made-this-way-edit-is-asfaloth-coming-as-the-new-mount/?do=findComment&comment=629687","commentId":629687,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1336749117,"content":"Wow, have you seen the new version of Aragorn?

I think the effect fits Leadership very much, original Aragorn, Elrohir, Imrahil, they all have ready effects \"in them\" plus other Leadership cards do as well; and no Lore card does. In a similar way, cards like For Gondor! or Dúnedain Mark boost attack, and Dúnedain Quest or Celebrian's Stone or Sword that was Broken boost willpower.
