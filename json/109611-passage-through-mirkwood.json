The last stage of the quest is saying \"The players must find and defeat Ungoliaths Spawn to win this game\".\n\n \n\nIn case we already met and killed it, do we instantly win? Or we have to wait until he comes once again and kill him second time?\n\n \n\nThx for answer! :-) "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109611-passage-through-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=1136464","commentId":1136464,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1403960513,"content":"im afraid you must find and kill it again! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] but you can search the discard pile so you shouldnt have to wait :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109611-passage-through-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=1136466","commentId":1136466,"userName":"jerry1989","timestamp":1403960740,"content":"y, u are right, thank you, we just didnt notice that win condition at first... "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109611-passage-through-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=1136474","commentId":1136474,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1403961362,"content":"Welcome jerry, i think you are new ^^"}]}
