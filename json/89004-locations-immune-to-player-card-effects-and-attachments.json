That is in the FAQ (just under the immune location ruling), and the idea is that Quick Strike targets a player's character, not the enemy.\n\n \n\nThe initial ruling by Caleb concerning the location was similar: you can attach a card to a location, but effects that target the location do not apply. On the other hand, effects that target a character still apply, such as in Ancient Mathom. Caleb even specified that if a card cannot have attachments, then it will read \"Cannot have attachments.\" I found this ruling more consistent with the Quick Strike ruling above."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89004-locations-immune-to-player-card-effects-and-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=848853","commentId":848853,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1377316691,"content":">  \n> \n> > I agree with FAQ immune locations or enemy cannot be choose as a target.

You dont target any enemy you target a character."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89004-locations-immune-to-player-card-effects-and-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=849144","commentId":849144,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1377361596,"content":"> Yes quick strike alredy have 3 times change the rules form the begin.

The original ruling by Caleb is to authorise attachments, ignoring effects on the location itself, but allowing effects that target the characters. The latest FAQ ruling reverses this and makes the location ruling inconsistent with the enemy ruling."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89004-locations-immune-to-player-card-effects-and-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=849537","commentId":849537,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1377406266,"content":">  \n> \n> > Yes quick strike alredy have 3 times change the rules form the begin.

Is only thing i dont like and dont agree with designers: now surge, doom and Guarded apply only when they cards revealed from the encounter deck.

Indeed, they revised the initial ruling:\n\n \n\n> Yes, we have reconsidered our original ruling and decided that players cannot play attachments on locations that are immune to player card effects as attaching a card to a location is targeting that location. The previous ruling was contradictory to the rest of the restrictions of \"immune to player card effects\" and this ruling keeps it consistent."}]}
