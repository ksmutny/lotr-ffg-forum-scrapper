A card like Tree People involves multiple decisions, both in who you pick up and which of the top 5 you put into play.\n\n \n\nBut certain 0-cost cards like Entmoot and Eagles are Coming are practically decisionless. Yes you can decide not to include it in your deck, but even then with some math you can remove that decision. If at least 1 in 5 cards in your deck are Ent cards, then the expected number of cards you will get from Entmoot is >=1, and it becomes a no-brainer to include because at worst it's a deck-thinner. Any less than 1 in 5 and you will whiff more than you succeed and it's probably not worth including, although I'm sure there are decks that are just looking for a specific card like Treebeard or Landroval and are ok with paying the cost of whiffing.\n\n \n\nAnyway, in my opinion deckbuilding is not where the decisions around a card should end. There shouldn't be cards in the game where when you draw them, you always play them, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nEdited January 3, 2017 by Seastan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238589-the-dungeons-of-cirith-gurat/?do=findComment&comment=2569917","commentId":2569917,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1483491207,"content":"Unless you have Treebeard hero, Entmoot isn't as straightforward as The Eagles are Coming.  You may be unable to play it when drawn, so even with 10 other Ent cards in the deck it's not at worst a deck-thinner.  At worst it's a dead card.  Eagles are Coming is rarely a dead card (only if all the Eagles have been drawn already), but I don't grant that it's \"at worst a deck-thinner\" because the return isn't guaranteed.  Daeron's Runes and (dwarf-free) We Are Not Idle are deck thinners.  EAC can fetch you 0 cards or 5 cards.  Even if the expected return is >1, the probability of whiffing is still significant.\n\n \n\nOf course, I think it's justifiable to include even if the expected return is < 1, as long as Eagles are more important than the average card to my strategy.  Even when EAC whiffs, it has the beneficial side effect of reshuffling the deck if an Eagle would not have been within the next five cards.\n\n \n\nI'll grant that if you can play it there's no reason not to play it outside some edge cases.  That's largely true of Daeron's Runes as well, though that does give you an actual decision to make on the discard.  However, while it's exceptional to have a card that is effectively always played when drawn for every deck it is in, it's not rare at all for a particular deck to have a card that is effectively always played when drawn, given that particular deck's strategy, and the choices made when playing it are made when constructing the deck rather than playing it.  Free or effectively-free attachments generally get played when drawn and I usually know exactly who they will go on before they are ever drawn.  That's even true of some cost-1 cards -- there's generally not any on-the-fly decision making involved in putting Light of Valinor on SpGlorfindel or Gondorian Shield on TaBoromir.  That decision was made when the deck was assembled.\n\n \n\nCards that require decision making are more interesting to play, but I have no problem with cards that auto-play as long as they aren't also auto-include or utterly useless.  If Eagles are Coming represent essentially a passive boost to Eagles deck -- well, it's not that strong a tribe and needs the help.  Providing an essentially passive boost from an auto-playing player card doesn't seem any different in principle to me than providing a passive boost to an archtype by including a particular hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238589-the-dungeons-of-cirith-gurat/?do=findComment&comment=2569929","commentId":2569929,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1483491781,"content":"Btw...

But in the long run you'll be getting >=1 ally per use of the card, and in the long run your deck will be more consistent with the card than without it. It's a \"statistical\" deck-thinner. But I think we can both agree that in Ent/Eagle heavy decks, Entmoot/EaC are both auto-include and auto-play. For these few cards, it's the game playing the game. They aren't so much cards, but gameplay instructions.\n\n \n\nYou are right that it can be considered a passive boost to an archetype akin to including a particular hero. The reason I find that to be a problem is because it's kind of like how you can \"choose\" to build a Dwarf deck without Dain - it just can't be near as good. Too much of this kind of thing makes for boring deckbuilding because it takes away decisions. I have nothing against global buffs, especially if it's a weaker trait like eagles that needs it. But there are plenty of ways to buff an archetype in a non-automatic way.\n\n \n\nNow you may be perfectly fine with your 47 decisions when making and Ent deck. Some people may want even more auto-includes so they only need to decide on 40 cards. I can't argue with that. It's just that I personally find deckbuilding more interesting and creative when there are 50 choices to make.\n\n \n\nAs for 1-cost cards, they are always a decision to play because resources are limited. Sure, LoV on Glorfindel is an obvious play, but I've held off on it before because I wanted to save a resource for Test of Will. For free attachments, you still have to decide who to put them on. And even if the choice is obvious they typically have Responses or Actions on them that you need to decide to trigger throughout the game. One might think that a free attachment like Love of Tales is automatic, but I can say though experience with that card that it introduces frequent decisions into the gameplay."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238589-the-dungeons-of-cirith-gurat/?do=findComment&comment=2570079","commentId":2570079,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1483503037,"content":"> So they're resurrecting Valour as well?

Not the longest quest ever, but with 2 player I think it took us a little over an hour. The first stage can throw a lot of threat your way, and there's a particular enemy that will have attacks flying your way as it's revealed that surges, which is a pain. It wasn't one of those \"this card comes up and you lose\" type of quests though. Me and my partner had a good time playing it!
