It specifies that the most recent of the effects is the one that is used for resolution. To wit:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> If multiple replacement effects are initiated against the same triggering condition, the most recent replacement effect is the one that is used for the resolution of the triggering condition.\n\nThe A copy thus automatically whiffs: the progress placement has already been replaced and cannot be replaced again.\n\nSimilarly, if you targeted enemy A twice, only one copy (the later one, technically) can resolve.\n\nEdited February 24, 2019 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291392-multiple-ride-them-downs/?do=findComment&comment=3633024","commentId":3633024,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1551053601,"content":"If the card said 'deal X damage to an enemy, where X is the number of progress would be placed on the quest,' you could play multiple copies, as there would be multiple instances of 'deal X damage.'  With the way it is actually written, there is no instance of 'deal X damage.'  Instead, playing multiple copies would twice queue up the effect 'assign progress as damage instead.'  Since game allows you to place progress only once per question resolution, this effectively does nothing. "}]}
