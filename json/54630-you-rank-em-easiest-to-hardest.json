I was thinking about which quest to do next, when my brain sidetracked and I stated to wonder about the difficulty order of the quests. I know they have numbered difficulty, but I'm interested in your thoughts.\n\nSo, who wants to try ranking the quests from easiest to most difficult? I don't have a ton of experience with most of them (well, I have experience losing at them) but I would very much like to hear your opinion. Feel free to omit any that you aren't comfortable ranking, and add any commentary that you may want. I'll take the plunge and list mine first.\n\nFrom easiest to hardest:\n\n1. Passage Through Mirkwood\n2. The Hunt for Gollum\n3. The Hills of Emyn Muil\n4. Journey Down the Anduin\n5. A Journey to Rhosgobel\n6. Conflict at the Carrock\n7. Escape from Dol Guldur\n8.

It does not often whilst wild things happen frequently in the Carrock, the chances are just so much higher.\n\n \n\nYou can, but it's not a dealbreaker like in Anduin because there are no Treacheries that trigger off high threat (killing off you weak and your fodder). Played Carrock again today, never at a single moment was there ever a feeling that a draw for staging would kill us. Of course, with Henamarth + Denethor bottoming out Sacked! and Eleanor (or the Spirit canceller) there for Roasted (so it doesn't reshuffle back, keeping the Sacked! on the bottom as well). Today's game went so smooth, took on the Trolls one by one, hell, even lame Dunhere got to attack a Troll in the staging area, something that almost never works. Gloin was happily taking undefended damage from Misty Mountain Goblins, thus removing progress tokens, then healed back up with Daughter, so paying for Grimbeorn took no time at all (no such help in Anduin). There also only two quest cards and the second requires a massive 1 progress, compared to what, 15 for stage 2 in Anduin (with 3 cards drawn in 2-player) and the final Ambush (which I grant you can be really lame with just some Eastern Crows out there). Tomorrow's play of Carrock features decks with no Miners, so Sacked! are going to stick around (if drawn, can always get them as Shadow Effect for non-trolls) until I can kill off the Unique Trolls. But mostly I think the Treacheries are what leave Carrock so easy, Despair in Anduin can be nasty, stage 1 just as you're about to kill the Troll, suddenly need to quest for another turn, but in Carrock they just buy you more time to prepare, there is no automatic 6-attack, 12-hp Enemy waiting to slap you down (which happens usually turn 2 as three of my decks have starting threat of 29)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54630-you-rank-em-easiest-to-hardest/?do=findComment&comment=541469","commentId":541469,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1318501837,"content":" 1.

In Carrock you (in general) have time to lower your threat so that you can stay under that 30 point radar. In Anduin, depending on the deck you're playing you only have a couple of turns at the most. Once you're under that radar and you can stay that way, Carrock becomes a piece of cake. Anduin, not so much, as it as tougher lower threat enemies"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54630-you-rank-em-easiest-to-hardest/?do=findComment&comment=541606","commentId":541606,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1318518086,"content":"Conykchameleon, did I read that wrong or did you write the wrong name, but reads like you agree with me that Anduin doesn't give you time and Carrock does.

Today's game was perhaps the closest, mostly due to only getting 1x Gandalf for each deck for threat reduction. Actually lost a hero to Sacked! + Roasted, but had played Landroval that same turn, so Theodred came right back. Both Hill Trolls and Marsh Adder were engaged and killed during stage 1 (they came on during separate turns and each was killed in a single attack). Finally reached stage 2 with threat at 40 for both, so with 2 Trolls each, 46 threat after they attacked. Louis went down first, then Stuart, both that same turn. Quested with everyone to clear Carrock and put enough progress on the quest card to survive Misty Mountain Goblins ability. Grim Resolve everyone up, fodder takes Troll attacks, then Gimli single-handedly kills Morris, Grimbeorn, Legolas, Aragorn and co take out Rupert.\n\nHaving gone through the Encounter deck after the game, there is one last point I want to make. Lack of +attack Shadow Effects. While that doesn't seem too big, if I looked right, there are only 2x Wargs in the deck that boost attacks. That means that undefended attacks will almost always do what the stat say, so it is easy and simple to plan for those. In other quests, you have those +1 att (+3 if undefended) that can turn a survivable attack into a hero-killer. This game, Gimli with 2 wounds + Citadel Plate was able to take an undefended attack from a Hill Troll (putting him at 8/9 wounds) with very little risk as one of the Wargs had already been killed. Not sure I'd like to chance it in Anduin for example. Muck Adder's -1 defense and Despair's defender doesn't count defense can be nasty when you're planning on having the defender survive, but against undefended attacks they help nothing at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54630-you-rank-em-easiest-to-hardest/?do=findComment&comment=542000","commentId":542000,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1318596289,"content":"You made a good point about Carrock and shadow effects.
