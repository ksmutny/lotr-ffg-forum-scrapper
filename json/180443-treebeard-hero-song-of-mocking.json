Main motivations for doing this is keeping Treebeard alive and some heroes for benefiting on some damage (Gloin, Gimli).\n\n \n\nQuestion 1, If you use Treebeard his action while Song of Mocking is active on him, does he still get the Willpower and Attack boost?\n\n \n\nAnswer 1, Since Treebeard never got any damage dealt, he cannot receive the boost.\n\n \n\n \n\nQuestion 2, Because the Action starts, with  \"deal 1 damage to Treebeard\", I was wondering if I could actually trigger this action. Since it is impossible to deal any damage to Treebeard (because of the song), can I actually trigger this action to transfer the damage to Gloin?\n\n \n\nAnswer 2, No Clue\n\n \n\nQuestion 3, Suppose the answer to Question 2 is \"Yes\", The Action clearly says \"Deal 1 damage to Treebeard to give him [boost]\". Since you are not giving him the boost, does this damage dealt still count toward the \"limit 5 times per phase\" ?\n\n \n\nAnswer 3, I guess so.\n\n \n\nIt's not entirely clear, because by playing the action you immediately deal the damage, but by song of mocking the damage is assigned to another hero. Also sending this to the developers, answers soon I hope.\n\n \n\nSong-of-Mocking.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Dead-Marshes/Song-of-Mocking.png]\n\n \n\nTreebeard.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Treason-of-Saruman/Treebeard.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1662099","commentId":1662099,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1434490650,"content":"I'd say\n\n \n\n1) he does not get the willpower boost, for the reason you cited above,\n\n \n\n2) you can trigger it, because 'dealing damage' might be made up of two steps, 'assigning' and then 'dealing' damage (putting on damage tokens).  In the case of Archery, you assign each point of Archery damage (and cannot assign damage past a character's remaining hit points), then deal all points of damage simultaneously (so you can assign damage to multiple Silvan Refugees).  If we are able to use the same reasoning here, you can assign damage to Treebeard when you trigger the action, although you never actually deal it, since Song of Mocking whisks it away.\n\n \n\n3) I think limits apply to triggering the action, not to their effect.  So you are limited to triggering the action 5 times per phase (not limited to getting +5 willpower per phase).  So triggering the effect, even if it does not damage Treebeard, will still contribute to the 5x limit."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1662117","commentId":1662117,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1434491885,"content":"I agree.

I do think you can trigger his action (in disagreement with JanB). Triggering an action is when you pay the cost. Resolving the action is when you apply the effect. You trigger the action and pay the cost, which is dealing damage. Then a second condition (song of mocking) interrupts the process at that point and prevents the resolution (so Treebeard does not get his Stat boost). Song of mocking does not prevent you from triggering the ability in the first place; that wouldn't even make sense."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1662847","commentId":1662847,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1434550663,"content":"mm, ok.. so after a shadowcard is revealed you can deal Erkenbrand one damage ... use Song of Mocking to deal the damage for example to Gloin instead ... and not cancel the shadowcardeffect? \n\nEdited June 17, 2015 by JanB"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1662864","commentId":1662864,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1434551620,"content":"Yes, I'm pretty sure that would work.\n\nEdited June 17, 2015 by PocketWraith"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1662867","commentId":1662867,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1434551645,"content":"Seems legit."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1662943","commentId":1662943,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1434553653,"content":"An encounter card might say \"Players cannot lower discard cards,\" or something.  Then you couldn't trigger an effect that like Eowyn... but Song of Mocking isn't a \"cannot\" effect.  The damage in these cases still happens... but then something happens to it.  So it's not a good parallel.\n\n \n\nWe'll have to see what the official answer is!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1664548","commentId":1664548,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1434658764,"content":"Reply from Caleb,\n\n \n\n> You can use Song of Mocking to trigger Treebeard’s effect and assign the damage to another hero, but the limit 5 times per phase does still apply.\n> \n> Cheers,\n> \n> Caleb\n> \n>  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1664562","commentId":1664562,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1434659658,"content":"Ohhhh, NOW I get it.  There is a \"Jban\" and a \"JanB\" and BOTH use Bilbo-flippin'-Baggins avatars.\n\n \n\nMan that has been confusing me!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1664576","commentId":1664576,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1434660320,"content":"^^\n\n \n\nJban - nabJ\n\nEdited June 18, 2015 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1687934","commentId":1687934,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1436530913,"content":"I’m writing back to correct my previous answer to your rules question regarding Treebeard and Song of Mocking.

I find the ruling makes sense to me, but Caleb's focus on the word \"instead\" doesn't. Even if Song of Mocking said \"After damage has been dealt to another hero, cancel that damage and deal an equal amount of damage to a hero with the Song attached\" it still wouldn't work because the damage got cancelled, as we see with the Erkenbrand/Wing helm ruling. They are basically saying with all these \"Deal X damage to\" effects that if you don't visibly see damage counters on the card after you're done, it doesn't work. It's a fair ruling, but I think ruling the opposite way would have also been fair and at the same time opened up more card combination possibilities. I love it when new cards make old, unused cards suddenly useful, but I guess today is not the day."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180443-treebeard-hero-song-of-mocking/?do=findComment&comment=1688191","commentId":1688191,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1436545131,"content":"> I’m writing back to correct my previous answer to your rules question regarding Treebeard and Song of Mocking.
