Travel effects are costs or restrictions that some or all players must pay or meet in order to travel to that location. If the players cannot fulfill the requirement of a location’s travel effect, the players cannot travel to that location\n\nSo as NathanH says, the answer is no. If something is merely a consequence of travel, rather than a cost, it will be represented as a Response, or a Forced, rather than a Travel effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/261032-can-i-travel/?do=findComment&comment=3037880","commentId":3037880,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1508591329,"content":"> On 2017-10-18 at 0:54 PM, Bullroarer Took said:\n> \n> This type of long winded response is confusing for players looking for a simple straight forward answer.  Please stay on point.\n\nOK"}]}
