They are different entities, the first is mutable and the second immutable.\n\nI am developing the Fellowships feature. A Fellowship is a link between decks that work well together or are meant to be played together.\n\n \n\nWhen creating a fellowship, you can select any of your own private or public decks. Also, to increase the social aspect of RingsDB, you will be able to select other people's private (if they enable \"share my decks\" in profile settings) or public decks.\n\n \n\nIf you select another player's private deck, a copy of their deck will be added to your own collection, allowing the deck owner to make changes to their version of the deck (or delete it) without affecting your Fellowship.\n\nPublic decks won't be copied because they are immutable.\n\n \n\nA fellowship is private when first created. You can then publish it. When publishing a fellowship, every private deck in it will also be published.\n\nThis way, public Fellowships always contains public decks. Private Fellowships can contain both public and private decks.\n\n \n\nWhen logging a quest, you can start by selecting a fellowship or individual decks. The quest log screen will show up to 4 selected decks.\n\nEven if you started by selecting a fellowship, you will be able to add or remove decks, but since the group itself was changed, this log will not be linked to the selected fellowship.\n\n \n\nFor each selected deck you can do some card swapping, adding or removing cards that better suit the quest.  Red exclamation marks will warn you about repeated unique cards between multiple decks. Yellow exclamation marks will warn you if the total number of copies across all selected decks are over your card collection limit. This will allow some in place changes to fix it.\n\n \n\nYou will then log the quest, it's result, score and notes.\n\n \n\nIf you view any of the previously selected decks, you will see the quest result and what changes were made to the deck.\n\nIf you go to the fellowships page, you will see every quest result that was logged using exactly the fellowship decks (even with card modifications and even if you did not select the fellowship before questing).\n\n \n\n-----------------------\n\n \n\nWhen logging a quest you will be able to mark it as public, allowing other players to see your result when they view the deck or quest pages. \n\n \n\nSome problems I'm facing:\n\n * What to do with private decks used in a quest when the quest is marked as public?\n   \n * What should I do to incentive players to select their decks and make card changes before playing the quest? The exclamation marks is a good feature to cross check the decks, but it is useless if players try to log a quest after they have played it.\n   \n\n \n\nI hope to get some feedback that will allow RingsDB to get even better.\n\nEdited March 31, 2016 by Sydtrack"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206879-introducing-ringsdb-a-new-deck-builder-based-on-netrunnerdb-and-thronesdb/?do=findComment&comment=2143205","commentId":2143205,"userName":"Sydtrack","timestamp":1459455461,"content":"> I dunno if this is even doable, but I'd like to see something where you can either:\n> \n>  \n> \n> A) Build multiple decks at one time\n> \n> or\n> \n> B ) Have a setting where you can tell the deck builder to take into consideration cards in another decklist on your profile for purposes of them being used in your collection.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I think both of those sound confusing, so I'll try to give an example that makes a bit more sense of what Im hoping for.\n> \n>  \n> \n> My wife and I like to play 4 player (both of us using 2 decks).

First of all; I like that style of the pages and all the extra functions. It seems that your site is skyrocketing all other deckbuilders. Congratualtions! But I think (at least the deckbuilder itself) is not so intuitive to use as cardgamedb.com. I mean, for a quick research it is easier to click a few buttons than typing a line of text. Well, or I have to get used to it.. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\nAnyways, I do have some suggestions for (minor) improvements to make.\n\nDo you mind adding a \"do not include certain cards\" in the search for decks? That would be very helpful when needing a deck for group play!\n\nAs I have to use the \"Filter Help\" quite often, it would be good if that popup yould not be hovering above the card list, so I had the option lo have it displayed all the time.\n\nHavingHis is more an advanced thing: having a button to hide \"impossible cards\" - e.g. having no dwarf in the deck, then not showing the Dwarowdwelf Axe in the search results.\n\nAnd last but not least \"k:Noldor|Noble\" works but \"k:Ranger&Noble\" does not. This would be also a nice feature.\n\n \n\nMaybe that all is allready implemented and I just do not see these things... in that case ... my appologies.\n\n \n\nThank you in advance for considering my ideas.\n\nEdited April 9, 2016 by Flrbb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206879-introducing-ringsdb-a-new-deck-builder-based-on-netrunnerdb-and-thronesdb/?do=findComment&comment=2159118","commentId":2159118,"userName":"blinky","timestamp":1460196840,"content":"> And last but not least \"k:Noldor|Noble\" works but \"k:Ranger&Noble\" does not.
