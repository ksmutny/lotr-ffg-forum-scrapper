Does the second Signs that I drew from Eleanor's ability count as the card revealed by the guarded keyword for the first Signs?  Because if so, it seems that the rules indicate I should reveal another card to guard the first Signs.\n\n \n\n2. For the second Signs, do I reveal another card to guard it?\n\n \n\nI am guessing that the answer to question 1 is \"no\" and that the first Signs will remain unguarded (because the treachery was the one that was supposed to guard it) and that the answer to question 2 is \"yes\", that I need to reveal another card to guard it\n\n \n\n(And then after this I will have to reveal another card as part of the staging process)\n\n \n\nPlease let me know how to play out this situation.\n\n \n\nthanks\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99068-guarded-treacheries-and-eleanor/?do=findComment&comment=982184","commentId":982184,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1392165855,"content":"Yes.\n\n \n\nYou canceled the when revealed card that is \"guarding\" the objective. Her text specifically says \"replace\". So the new one replaces the old one guarding the clue or w/e it is I forget now.\n\n \n\nIn comparison Test of Will, just cancels the card. So no new card is drawn.\n\n \n\nAnother thing is if you draw a guarded clue, and the guarded card you draw is another clue. The 2nd clue goes in the staging area, and now you draw 2 cards to guard them. Starting with the 1st clue then the 2nd."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99068-guarded-treacheries-and-eleanor/?do=findComment&comment=983508","commentId":983508,"userName":"konokono","timestamp":1392268784,"content":"Thanks, i think I understand.\n\n \n\nEleanor's ability replaces the treachery, so the next card drawn would be the card guarding the first clue.  But since the next card drawn was a clue, I need to draw another card to guard the first clue, as per the rules, and then another card to guard the second clue"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99068-guarded-treacheries-and-eleanor/?do=findComment&comment=983522","commentId":983522,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1392270146,"content":"yup!\n\n \n\nThat is how I do it..
