Building your deck around something like path of Need, which is 1 per deck, requires much fetching and drawing, but i found for example Elrond decks usually get his ring without Problem. It is 3 copies and you can take a Mulligan. I don't think I would like a 100% Chance of having a specific Card in my starting Hand, would make games too boring. It is fine having to wait for Things like strider for some turns.\n\nEdited August 23, 2016 by Calvadur"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228393-strider/?do=findComment&comment=2381819","commentId":2381819,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1472009681,"content":"> https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/8/23/strider/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/8/23/strider/]\n> \n>  \n> \n> So... a preview with absolutely nothing new.

I know it still doesn't feel completly right, but at least a Little bit better when one of the Designers says they thought about it and are fine with houseruling it.\n\n \n\nI sent a message to Matt Newman after the announcement article for Flight of the Stormcaller, which mentioned support for decks with two or fewer heroes, and asked about saga heroes. He wrote back:\n\n \n\n> Unfortunately it's a bit late to make any changes to the cards, so they'll be printed as they are. Besides, we tend to keep certain saga considerations separate when making cards for the cycle (and occasionally vice-versa) – it might be confusing for somebody picking up a cycle pack to see bilbo and fellowship symbols if they've never played the saga before.\n>  \n> That being said, if you want to play those cards in that way (2 or less non-bilbo/non-fellowship heroes) you have my blessing to play them that way.\n\n \n\nEven though the article doesn't have any spoilers, I appreciate hearing that the designers are designing for players like me, who \"bear an interest in recreating some of the themes, scenes, and tensions they remember from the books\" and \"may wish to develop a small and secretive fellowship—like the one from J.R.R. Tolkien's novels.\"\n \nI'm still hoping that eventually enough cards like Strider will be released that I can do the Sam and Frodo saga quests with no (or almost no) permanent allies. I would use ally Elrond and core set Gandalf, together with hero Galadriel as my third hero (taking advantage of this houserule for Strider). They would represent luck/providence/support from afar, like the moment after escaping Cirith Ungol when Sam says: \"If only the Lady could see us or hear us, I’d say to her: 'Your Ladyship, all we want is light and water: just clean water and plain daylight, better than any jewels, begging your pardon,'\" and within a few hours the sky grew lighter (as dawn reached the Pelennor and the Witch-king met his doom) and they found a little streamlet of water. With the right attachments and events released in the future, a deck like this just might work.\nEdited August 24, 2016 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228393-strider/?do=findComment&comment=2382685","commentId":2382685,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1472056374,"content":"I really like this card, I already have ideas for a 2 heroes deck with Damrod..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228393-strider/?do=findComment&comment=2383280","commentId":2383280,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1472076544,"content":"Does anyone know when the new AP goes up on RingsDB?"}]}
