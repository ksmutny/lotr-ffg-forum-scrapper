STRONG!\n\n \n\nThe card reads: \"Forced: After Hummerhorns engages you, deal 5 damage to a single hero you control.\"\n\n \n\nDoes it's Forced ability triggers if you optionally engaged it?\n\nIf so... How do you beat it solo? Not gathering threat and dealing damage through Gandalf and Dúnhere?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58977-hummerhorns/?do=findComment&comment=579551","commentId":579551,"userName":"alpha5099","timestamp":1326586965,"content":"The Forced goes off either way:\n\nRules, Page 16: \"Whether an enemy is engaged through an engagement check, through a card effect, or through a player’s choice, the end result is the same, with the enemy and the player engaging one another.
