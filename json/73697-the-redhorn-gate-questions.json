Does it come back again?\n\n\n\nYes, it is officially ruled that it will become the active location even if it is in the Victory Pile.  I think this entry is in the FAQ.\n\nMaggical said:\n\n- What happens if you beat it again? Will you gain twice the victory points (once from Northern Tracker and once for defeating it the normal way)?\n\n\n\n \n\nNo, you just get the VP in your Victory Pile as is.  If it is removed from the Victory Pile, you don't get the VP.  It has no \"memory\" of the card which is removed.\n\nMaggical said:\n\n \n\n- Discarded characters (due to being at 0 or less Willpower) are considered dead when calculating the final score or not?\n\nThanks!\n\nJavier\n\n\n\nDiscarded Heroes are considered dead in final score calculation, allies are irrelevant."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73697-the-redhorn-gate-questions/?do=findComment&comment=718500","commentId":718500,"userName":"Maggical","timestamp":1351941324,"content":" Thanks a lot for the replies, glad I played the game making the correct desitions! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"}]}
