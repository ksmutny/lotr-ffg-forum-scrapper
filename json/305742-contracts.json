(I think it's a difficult quest solo anyway even without contracts) so I'm back to going against the quest without a contract. \n\n \n\nI used fellowship, then multiple attempts at Burglars turn then the Grey wanderer a few times. \n\nI think the concept is great but feel there isn't enough benefit against the core concepts of the game, I.e\n\nDraw one card per turn\n\nOne resource per hero per turn\n\nNeed threat reduction \n\nNeed questing\n\nNeed defense\n\nNeed attack\n\nCancel or deal with archery. \n\n \n\nIn the wrath and ruin quest you need all of the above from turn 1. \n\nI feel the drawbacks of the contracts are a little too severe especially Burglars Turn which prohibits any attachments in your deck or duplicates in the treasure stack of only 14 cards. And the cards are randomly pulled and only played if you travel. It's not so much as a thematic boost as a thematic nightmare mode. \n\nThe wanderer sounds and feels thematically brilliant but starting with one hero is still massively handicapped even with the b side of the quest. \n\nMaybe in multiplayer they shine but for now they are more a novelty than a winning strategy . "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305742-contracts/?do=findComment&comment=3893203","commentId":3893203,"userName":"asgardianphil","timestamp":1581610686,"content":"I think they should have made them a little bit more like Decipher's Star Wars CCG events, double sided purple ones.
