In the case of this attachment the Song card would allow a hero to wield it when usually he wouldn't be able to. I'm sure that going forward there will be many more sphere specific attachments, but for now I'd echo the majority and say that the card doesn't belong in a mono-sphere deck and that that's okay - there should be cards that target specific playstyles."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53690-houseruled-application-of-songs/?do=findComment&comment=536584","commentId":536584,"userName":"Puzzle2","timestamp":1317679590,"content":" There seems to be some confusion about what these songs actually do.
