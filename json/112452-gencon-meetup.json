So if anyone wants to just meetup and play then let me know! I'm usually in the ICC card hall till the wee hours of the morning :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] My email is andreball83@gmail.com"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112452-gencon-meetup/?do=findComment&comment=1182999","commentId":1182999,"userName":"McDog3","timestamp":1407176890,"content":"Do you listen to the Cardboard of the Rings podcast?  Not sure if there are any tickets left, but everyone is welcome to attend (even without a ticket - they won't tell if you won't), they are holding a LOTR event Friday at 10:00 AM.  There will be prizes, laughter, and plenty of playthroughs of the gencon quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112452-gencon-meetup/?do=findComment&comment=1183176","commentId":1183176,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1407182974,"content":"Yes, you should definitely attend the CotR event - no need for a ticket. We of the Grey Company are also having a get together, at which all are welcome. It will be offsite (a bear needs his beer, after all) but we will meet at the FFG booth at 8 pm on Friday before heading out. In general, don't worry about not having tickets for specific GenCon events, there will be plenty of opportunities for fun and games. GenCon is gamer-geek Disneyland.\n\nEdited August 4, 2014 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112452-gencon-meetup/?do=findComment&comment=1183344","commentId":1183344,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1407187978,"content":"Sometimes I wish I lived west of the Atlantic.
