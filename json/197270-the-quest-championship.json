Favorite can mean, best designed, most thematic, most fun, great difficulty level, whatever criteria you wish. The quests with the most votes will make it to the first round of voting where 2 quests will be directly paired up, and everyone votes on 1 or the other. Eventually we will make it to our top 3 where you will vote for 1st 2nd and 3rd place. If you vote for the Nightmare version of a quest I will just count it as if for the regular one. \n\n \n\nThe 3rd round of voting is up! 1-10-15\n\n \n\n1.

By nature of being pulled straight from the source novels, the Saga ones fit neatly into that criteria. And since the GenCon quests don't depend on encounter cards available in prior deluxe expansions like the AP's do, they also trends to feel more consistent and well-thought-out.

Wastes of Eriador - The day/night mechanic in this game is really unique and ratchets up the tension in a fun way. Plus only being able to quest every other turn makes placing progress during that time so critical for success. I also enjoy the aspect of not being able to cancel treacheries at night as it allows me an excuse to forgo A Test of Will from my decks. Across the Ettenmoors was really disappointing in how easy it was.\n\n \n\n2. Trouble in Tharbad - The NM version adds some much needed difficulty to this enjoyable but easy quest. I enjoyed the mechanics of this quest a lot but found it too bland, the enemies weren't that interesting. NM added in a diverse set of new enemies and interesting treacheries that make you feel like your in a city being hunted.\n\n \n\n3. Fog on the Barrow Downs - I like the separation aspect introduced in Foundations but it is not always done right, as in Breaking of the Fellowship. Here it fits, and feels perilous because you never know when you will be separated from your friends.\n\n \n\n4. Conflict at the Carrock - This quest is just a blast and I love how simple it is, build up over a few turns than an epic troll smashing.\n\n \n\n5. Seventh Level - Stone of Erech never really clicked for me, though I'm not sure why... Seventh Level is the go to quest for swarms of low engagement cost enemies..\n\n \n\n6. Morgul Vale - This is the toughest one for me so far. Helm's Deep is appropriately epic, but I've had some of my most memorable moments fighting against Murzag and the Nazgul.\n\n \n\n7. Into Ithilien - I started this game right after ATS cycle and this was one of the first quests I played. I was destroyed many times by this quest until I finally completed it. This quest taught me how to play successfully in this game.\n\n \n\n8. Three Trials - This is the best quest from Ringmaker cycle in terms of theme and ingenuity. The 3 boss fights are diverse and engaging. Mount Gram really felt flat too me.\n\n \n\n9. Battle of Carn Dum - These quests are both difficult, but Carn Dum revitalized this recent cycle, and really feels fresh and challenging. I was getting to the point where only NM or saga quests really are challenging, until this one. Bring on the level 8's!\n\n \n\n10. Knife in the Dark - Best saga quest. Thematic and oh so juicy.\n\n \n\n11. Steward's Fear - The feel of this quest is great, and really scratches a city, treachery itch I occasionally get. Can't wait to try Murder a the Prancing Pony.\n\n \n\n12. The Druaden Forest - In NM mode this quest fundamentally alters how the game is played, by not allowing hero's to collect a resource every phase, meaning you have to gain resources solely through card effects.

Intruders in Chetwood vs. Fog on the Barrow Downs - I like fighting undeads :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\n4.

Seventh level vs. Stone of Erech - More or less the oposite of CatC, but not less fun.\n\n \n\n6. Morgul Vale vs. Helms Deep - Hardest vote this round! But I will go with Helms Deep as you really get this \"just a Little bit longer, just survive!\"-feeling\n\n \n\n7. Foundations of Stone vs. Into Ithilien - Foundations is a solid quest and I never really fell in love with Into Ithlien.\n\n \n\n8. Three Trials vs. Mount Gram - I'm voting for the Idea here. Even though it's probably to easy it's a cool idea (I hope NM will improve the quest). Three Trials is a quest that really annoyed me when I first played it, not knowing what was about to come. We were just a locaation and 1 Progress away from winning and this Guardians all revive? We won in the end, but we felt it took an unnessesary Long time as we coundn't survive 2 attacks from each Guardian in one round and had to take them out 1 by 1.\n\n\n\n9. Battle of Carn Dum vs. Journey in the Dark - My favorite quest (at the Moment :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] )\n\n \n\n10. Knife in the Dark vs. Journey Down the Anduin - 2nd best Saga quest! Anduin is a real classic, but that's not enough in a Championship like this.\n\n \n\n11. Steward’s Fear vs. Battle of Lake Town - One of my favorites from the AtS-Cycle and with a great Feeling and replayability. Once you know Laketown it looses pretty much of it's challenge.\n\n \n\n12. Flight From Moria vs. The Druaden Forest - Most of the time I hate getting punished for having to many Cards (Dunland-trap...) or being to slow (VoI + Ringmaker...), but somehow Druadan forest didn't have this effect on me and flight from Moria is to random for my liking\n\n \n\n13. Flight to the Ford vs. Shadow of the Past - I would vote for Shadow, but I had one of my best Moments in FttF: The Ring calls them made me engage 3 Black Riders (I only could have engaged one), what lead to Merry + 2 hitches and a sneak attacked beorn killing them all of, giving me an Encounter card free playarea :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png].\n\n \n\n14. Battle of 5 Armies vs. Redhorn Gate - Battle is the best Hobbit quest in my opinion and Redhorn Gate \"just\" a qualitiy quest.\n\n \n\n15. Blood of Gondor vs. Siege of Cair Andros - God what did I hate this quest (SoCA), but the joy after finally beating it! Like Dark Souls, just as a Card game. \n\n \n\n16. Journey at the Crossroads vs. Encounter at Amun Dun - EaAD isn't a really memorable quest and Crossroads Transports the ambush Feeling the way I wished Into Ithilien would have done.\n\n \n\n \n\nI already would like to thank jjenks476 for starting this, as it makes me want to play many quests I haven't touched in a long time!\n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1974705","commentId":1974705,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1452094763,"content":"1.  Wastes of Eriador - The Day/Night is awesome, but I wish the quest was actually winnable in 4 player.  I did like the safe locations in Ettenmoors, but the rest of the quest is pretty 'meh'.\n\n2.

Seventh level - Tough call.  Stone of Erech is good, but I've played Seventh Level at least 10x as many times.\n\n6. Helms Deep - Instant classic.  Morgul Vale is good, but there are some cards in that quest that are straight up bad design, imo.\n\n7.

Eriador is just garanteed badass.\n\n\n2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Breaking of Fellowship -\n\n\n3. Intruders in Chetwood vs. Fog on the Barrow Downs -\n\n\n4. Massing at Osiliath vs. Conflict at the Carrock - Massing has one of the best different stages mechanic. From skirmishes with the scouts to the mad dash over Pelenor fields with the Witch King in persuit. Carrock often felt too 'gamey' to me, as I tried NOT to quest to hard (still one of my fav from mirkwood though).\n\n\n5. Seventh level vs. Stone of Erech - Tried Stone once and wasn't impressed.\n\n\n6. Morgul Vale vs. Helms Deep - \n\n\n7. Foundations of Stone vs. Into Ithilien - Into Ithilien was really annoying when it came out as there where few decks that could possibly beat it. Now it feels like Journey Down the Anduin once was the as the go-to quest for trying out new decks with high difficulty.\n\n\n8. Three Trials vs. Mount Gram - Trials didn't click for me. Mount Gram really needs a nightmare version to make the most of it but at least it's untapped potential now.\n\n\n9. Battle of Carn Dum vs. Journey in the Dark - \n\n\n10. Knife in the Dark vs. Journey Down the Anduin - The Black Riders box feels thematically silly to me. Nazgul aren't suppose to 'swarm' the good guys. In fact, Tolkien mentioned explicitly that their attacks were about fear not violence when discussing the movie adaptation.\n\n\n11. Steward’s Fear vs. Battle of Lake Town - Never liked Stewards Fear. Maybe I'll grow fond it of one day.\n\n\n12. Flight From Moria vs. The Druaden Forest - It's thematic that running away from the Balrog can accidentily lead you to an exit or get's you lost forever. In a way this was a pre-sidequest quest. Just a tad too random. Druadan Forest was just mechanics to me.\n\n\n13. Flight to the Ford vs. Shadow of the Past - When I tried Flight to the Ford, I was already Nazgul tired. Then you had all the burdens and I just gave up.\n\n\n14. Battle of 5 Armies vs. Redhorn Gate - Great all-round quest and good feel of a battle taking place. If only a turn 1 vanguard wasn't so deadly for solo.\n\n\n15. Blood of Gondor vs. Siege of Cair Andros - Love them both. Siege wins here though, because the ability to 'block' enemies with locations is very unique and leads to a completely new strategic thinking and playstyle. It's close though, because Master's Malice is BS.\n\n\n16.

I'll give some reasons though.\n\n \n\n1.  Across the Ettenmoors - I hven't found this one as easy as everyone else apparently has, and I like the mechanics. Difficult to choose though because I haven't played this or Wastes that many times.\n\n2. Breaking of Fellowship - I suspect my vote might go the other way if I'd played the Nightmare version of Tharbad, but the regular one is too easy and Breaking of the Fellowship is fun.\n\n3. Intruders in Chetwood - Difficult, because Barrow Downs barely missed my top 10 while Chetwood made it, but Chetwood has become my standard quest for testing decks. Other than the engagement stuff and threat raising it's handily generic, tests you on every front, and the variety of sidequests keeps it interesting.\n\n4. Massing at Osiliath - Also nicely generic and while the expanded card pool has made this one a lot easier than when it was released, it's still challenging. I like Carrock, especially in nightmare, but Massing is way more of a classic to me.\n\n5. Seventh level - I've rarely played Erech, but Seventh Level was the first Nightmare quest I ever beat and it's one I've gone back to a lot.\n\n6. Helm's Deep - Again, a top 10 versus an almost top 10. Helm's Deep is that much more epic though.\n\n7. Foundations of Stone - And again. Into Ithilien is nicely challenging, but Foundations of Stone is a classic and doesn't have the same kind of instant death cards.\n\n8. Three Trials - Three Trials is one of the best boss fight quests in the game, possibly the best full stop. Meanwhile I was never super fond of the prison break theme.\n\n9. Journey in the Dark - Carn Dum might win out in the long run, but right now it's too new for me to pick it over a quest as good and as thematic as Journey in the Dark\n\n10. Journey Down the Anduin - A classic, still a decent challenge in Nightmare. I've never been as fond of the Black Riders quests as some.\n\n11. Steward’s Fear - Lake-Town I view more as a puzzle to be solved than a quest to be played. I find more interest in building decks to beat it than actually playing it out, which turns into mostly a numbers game. Steward's Fear, on the other hand, is incredibly fun and varied however many times I replay it.\n\n12. The Druadan Forest - Flight from Moria is a quest I've never been that fond of. Druadan Forest isn't a favourite, but I enjoy it.\n\n13. Flight to the Ford - again, not so fond of the Black Riders quests, but I prefer the race to the finish over the frustration of Hide tests.\n\n14. Battle of 5 Armies - Redhorn Gate can be very random but otherwise tends to be on the easier side, 5 Armies is more challenging and more consistent.\n\n15. Siege of Cair Andros - Blood of Gondor is weird, random and I'm never entirely sure how to play it. Cair Andros is tough and certainly has its share of randomness, but I always know what I should be doing and I love the challenge, plus the Nightmare version adds even more interest to the strategic side of it.\n\n16. Encounter at Amon Din - I have enjoyed playing Crossroads so far, but I've also been bugged by the mechanics forcing you into certain approaches and playstyles. Amon Din is easy, but that also means it's accessible to pretty much any deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1977286","commentId":1977286,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1452199562,"content":" \n\n\n\n\n1.  Across Ettenmoors - Both are good quests, but the safe mechanic wins out here\n\n\n2. Trouble in Tharbad - I like Breaking, and Trouble is a bit too easy, but Trouble is so unique\n\n\n3. Fog on the Barrow Downs - Cool representation of the barrow section of the books\n\n\n4. Massing at Osiliath - Massing is still a classic\n\n\n5. Stone of Erech - I liked Seventh in its day, but Stone is more relevant these days\n\n\n6. Helms Deep - A difficult choice, but Helms Deep is so good\n\n\n7. Foundations of Stone - Easy one for me\n\n\n8. Three Trials - Two very unique quests that I love, but Three Trials just takes it\n\n\n9. Journey in the Dark - I really like Carn Dum, but the Balrog battle and epic sacrifice edges it out\n\n\n10. Knife in the Dark - The Nazguls win out over a quest that I've played dozens of times\n\n\n11. Battle of Lake Town - Stewad's Fear is probably the better quest, but I can't get over the epicness of battling Smaug!\n\n\n12. The Druadan Forest - prowl and persuading enemies. There's never been quite another scenario like the Druadan Forest\n\n\n13. Flight to the Ford - Really captures the feel of the race to the ford.\n\n\n14. Redhorn Gate - I know many people love Battle of 5 armies, but it never quite clicked for me enough to become a favorite.\n\n\n15. Siege of Cair Andros - I've warmed up to Blood, but Siege is great fun, although a little easy to demolish if you build for it these days\n\n\n16.

But I think the massing Wargs make for a better fight than the Trolls & Giants.\n\n \n\n2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Breaking of Fellowship: Abstaining from voting. Neither of these really did anything for me. Maybe it's time to replay them?\n\n \n\n3. Intruders in Chetwood vs. Fog on the Barrow Downs: The PoD scenarios will almost always win for me. They're tougher, they're thematic, and they're not linked to any Deluxe Expansion. It's just a more unique feel to the game and by nature have more though-out story lines and better constructed encounter decks.\n\n \n\n4. Massing at Osgiliath vs. Conflict at the Carrock: Carrock just feels passe at this point. Yeah it was tough, but it's gotten easier, and it feels too side-questy. It's just combat against 4 Trolls, each time. There's very little randomness, unless you count discovering Grimbeorn but with today's cardpool, that's hardly necessary anymore.\n\n \n\n5. Seventh Level vs. Stone of Erech: I absolutely love the Time mechanics in this game. And it was Undead enemies before we really had a full plate of those.\n\n \n\n6. Morgul Vale vs. Helm's Deep: I hated the Morgul Vale when I first played it. I still don't like it that much, as just an endless series of boss-fights. The Bodyguards are more frustrating than anything else, and feels like a cheap mechanic to make the quest tougher.\n\n \n\n7. Foundations of Stone vs. Into Ithilien: Currently my vote for the overall winner! Such a great mechanic, and especially adding in Nightmare Mode makes this quest a home run. Imagine being swept away from your fellow travellers and landing in a cave full of nightmarish ancient monsters. Great stuff.\n\n \n\n8. Three Trials vs. Escape from Mount Gram: I don't like escape quests, in video games or card games. They're boring to me. Too formulaic.\n\n \n\n9. Battle of Carn Dum vs. Journey in the Dark: Carn Dum is too tough - which isn't necessarily a bad thing in this game, but it's so pigeon-holed into one solution. Plus, Moria is my favorite part of the entire book series.\n\n \n\n10. Knife in the Dark vs. Journey Down the Anduin: I like the massing of enemies on stage 2. It's a cool approach to the theme of the story. Knife in the Dark seemed to depart too much from the books. But honestly, I don't care for either of these too much.\n\n \n\n11. Steward’s Fear vs. Battle of Lake Town: I want to vote for both! Lake-Town is such an awesome twist on a boss fight. Defending locations instead of characters. Steward's Fear, though, as insanely tough as it is for solo one-handed, is another thematic home run. I just wish the Underworld deck had more diverse cards than just the warmed-over Thugs we saw in Pelargir.\n\n \n\n12. Flight From Moria vs. The Druadan Forest: Anything in forests is a winner for me. It makes my mono-Lore Ranger Trap deck super thematic, though the Prowl mechanic was just not really difficult to manage at all, unfortunately.\n\n \n\n13. Flight to the Ford vs. Shadow of the Past: Declining from voting. The player cards in the first LotR Saga we great, but these quests were both a miss for me.\n\n \n\n14. Battle of 5 Armies vs. Redhorn Gate: This is the only quest I've played to date that I can remember losing a hero and feeling pretty OK with it. Not because it was easy - losing Dain Ironfoot on stage 2! - but how much it fit the storyline of the cards. Freezing Cold, Avalanches. Even a Dwarven king would die of hypothermia under those snowdrifts.\n\n \n\n15. Blood of Gondor vs. Siege of Cair Andros: I remember the first time my wife saw me playing this game, it was Blood of Gondor. And she was absolutely petrified of being taught to play, with cards upside down all over the place. Cair Andros wins for me, though, because of the neat idea of removing quest phases as you successfully retake each portion of the city.\n\n \n\n16. Journey to the Crossroads vs. Encounter at Amon Din: Both great thematic quests whose mechanic play well with the story idea, but Cross-roads was more of an appreciated challenge. Amon Din feels more personable, trying to prevent villagers from burning to death, but the first time I played it, I think I had rescued 25 villagers and lost 2, and that was really without deck-building too much.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1979193","commentId":1979193,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1452284732,"content":"1.

Foundations of Stone - Helm's Deep probably falls somewhere at the lower end of my top 10 quests, while Foundations of Stone is one of the first quests I think of when asked to pick favourites.\n\n4.

I find them all to be maximal thematic, as the relativly strong combat aspect isn't really a problem for me. It's a basic game mechanic and quests with a low enemie count often turn out boring. Casually questing through without having to fear enemies would destroy the illusion of the scary black rider for me. But giving hobbits boni against higher threat enemies is a fair enough deal to symbolise, that you don't want to face these guys, but have to overcome your fear to win the scenario. Looking at the combat more of a \"running away\" than actually \"killing\" the riders helps too. Obviously you could ask why a dagger helps you at running away, but I guess it could help you climb ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nOf Course it would have been awesome to make the black riders quests more or less combat free and I think there could have been a way to alter the gameplay so much, that you have a combat replacement, that doesn't abbadon the combat stats, so you could completly forget them, but you might as well keep it simple and straight out battle the riders, what is easier for new players, who, let's say, played the core set and then bought the black riders. Completly overthrowing the combat mechanism could easily confuse them. Writing this thinking about some custom rules for the black riders quests seems like an interesting idea..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1996062","commentId":1996062,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1453042139,"content":"1.
