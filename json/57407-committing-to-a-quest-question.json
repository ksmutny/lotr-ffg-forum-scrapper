You lay out one encounter card. You resolve the quest.\n\nWhen Phase 3 ends, your characters are no longer committed to any quests.\n\n \n\nWhen it says they remain committed to the quest, it means throughout Phase 3. This comes into play with characters like Aragorn, who can ready himself immediately after committing to a quest. Even though he's now ready, he's still committed to the quest throughout Phase 3.\n\n \n\nHope that helps happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57407-committing-to-a-quest-question/?do=findComment&comment=566204","commentId":566204,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1323534589,"content":"ah yes i see now, the above is correct, committing to questing or other actions such as defending, attacking, is an on going process, as this takes into account for killed allies/heros and also new cards played from your hand"}]}
