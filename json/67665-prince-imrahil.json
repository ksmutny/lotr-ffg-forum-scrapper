Kind of tough in Watcher in the Water, having all 3 heroes (with Theodred + Legolas) maxed out at 4hp, Striking Tentacles meant auto-kills if flipping bad for their Forced llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] . I do find Coragorn more reliable in terms of being ready thanks to his ability, particularly early on, though later, after more allies are out, chances of killing off a meatshield increase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67665-prince-imrahil/?do=findComment&comment=660128","commentId":660128,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1342584369,"content":"Are you talking in terms of duo play?

I am not a fan of high cost heroes period, so this guy is a little costly.. but I have been playign a 2 player Deck recently were my partner uses hamma+eagels and I run the prince and teh new Glorfindel and tun secrecy. The princes effect combos greatly with the eagles leaving play constantly as well as the rohan spirit leaving play effects… it is in fact a very strong 2 player deck. and of course mr fuckign broken Hamma dosn't hurt :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67665-prince-imrahil/?do=findComment&comment=660170","commentId":660170,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1342591216,"content":"I use him in a Rohan deck, and he's rock solid. Terrific with Bofur, too. I initially dismissed him as an inferior version of the Core Set Aragorn, but the ability to defend and attack in the same combat phase--something Aragorn can't do--is quite handy. One of my favorite heroes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67665-prince-imrahil/?do=findComment&comment=660175","commentId":660175,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1342591960,"content":"yeah the combo with Bofur (not sure if this is the right name the spirit card that jumps out to quest and then goes back on successful quest) is a great combo. If you have horn of Gondor out as well this is a zero cost combo as well. So you basically get 4 extar will on your questing for zero cost every turn… 5 if you have dain out… Very cool.\n\nThe untap effect is powerful and i think people over look this guys as he requires not only good deck building to pull off but also piloting.\n\nAnother under used combos with the prince is sneak / aloft + Descendant (untap, 1 dmg to each enemy in staging + add a egal counter to eagles of misty mountains)\n\nAn as said.. rohan has a ton of great synergies…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67665-prince-imrahil/?do=findComment&comment=660181","commentId":660181,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1342592650,"content":"Isn't prince from Gondor? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67665-prince-imrahil/?do=findComment&comment=660182","commentId":660182,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1342592803,"content":"no idea but it is eagels and rohan that have the majority of the sac effects,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67665-prince-imrahil/?do=findComment&comment=660338","commentId":660338,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1342608824,"content":"Imrahil is Prince of Dol Amroth which is part of Gondor.
