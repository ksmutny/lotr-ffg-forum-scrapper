Then, it makes an attack... \"you would not have to do it.  This is because the word \"then\" requires the previous sentence/clause to have been completed successfully, or else the \"then\" clause will not trigger.  If the Fire-drake's case, it is worded as \"and,\" so it will trigger regardless of whether or not the previous effect was successfully resolved.  A higher profile example of this, with a developer ruling, is the Sam hero.  (it doesn't use the word \"and,\" it just writes his effects -- readying and getting a stat boost -- as 2 separate sentences. Because the word \"then\" is not used, you can resolve the stat boosts even if Sam did not ready )\n\nSo in short yes, Fire-drake will attack if it was already in the staging area.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291929-several-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3642799","commentId":3642799,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1552064125,"content":"In Lost in Mirkwood,  you can't return the objective location to the staging area with Thror's Map during stages 1, 2, and 3.

Here is the ruling:\n\n \n\n\"In the past I have ruled that progress is placed simultaneously on the active location and quest, but I am reversing that ruling because it was counter-intuitive and created a lot of questions. So from now on, the active location must be fully explored before placing any progress on the current quest. That means you will resolve any effects that trigger as a result of the active location being explored before placing any progress on the quest.\nIn your situation, that would mean: \n1.
