This mission solo (with just one deck) is next to impossible. Hoping to hear differently from anyone.\n\nI have a plan that might work, but yet testing it.\n\nYour questions :\n\n1. Rules cover everything about guarded cards in p.24. They keep attached to the card guarding it until you eliminate it, when they go to staging area to be claimed, according to their own rules in the card.\n\n2. I had the same question a while ago when started trying and general consensus semed to agree that the Objective card, if drawn as Shadow card, goes to Discard Pile, so this is something you definitely want to avoid. If you have Dungeon Jailor on the table, better claim those cards asap."}]}
