Probably thanks to staying on-course throughout most of the voyage and swift questing, avoiding to see many ship-enemies.\n\nPlaying just now again, I've got a few things that need clearing.\n\nThe Fog Bank location says: \"While Fog Bank is the active location, Ship enemies do not make engagement checks, cannot attack, and cannot be attacked.\"\n\nDoes this stop me from optionally engaging 1 of the ship enemies in the staging area? I'm guessing no.\n\nDoes this stop me from attacking ship enemies with abilities that allow damaging enemies in the staging area? I assume yes.\n\nDoes this stop ship enemies from triggering their Archery keyword and causing damage? No idea."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203223-the-grey-havens-fog-bank/?do=findComment&comment=2063808","commentId":2063808,"userName":"Bellator Sardel","timestamp":1456036928,"content":"You can optionally engage, yes.\n\n \n\nYou cannot attack enemy ships, so things like Dunhere or Hands Upon the Bow would not work since you are actually attacking.  Something like Ranger Bow should work because you are not attacking, just dealing damage.\n\n \n\nDealing Archery damage is not the ship attacking, so you will still suffer it."}]}
