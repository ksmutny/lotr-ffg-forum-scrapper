I was specifically referring to the secrecy idea in reverse. Ie instead of Secrecy where you can play the card anytime but get a bonus if you are at 20 or lower threat there being essentially an opposite trait where you get bonuses if you are over 40 for example."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90156-wierd-things-you-would-like-to-see-in-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=863369","commentId":863369,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1378919953,"content":"There are a lot of things that I would like to see that I don't think are necessarily weird - even the super-quests that go beyond 50 threat were suggested by the core rulebook, which I'm very fond of mentioning  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]\n\n \n\nI never thought we'd see a Saruman player card, and yet I am shortly to be proven wrong!

It does sound like a good idea, having the two faces of Gollum. But perhaps having two separate cards would get around certain objections? So, rather than effects that flip the one card, the effect would be to \"put Smeagol into play\" and place the Gollum version out of play, and vice-versa. Hopefully that wouldn't be too fiddly (or objectionable).\n\n \n\nBut it is a really nice idea, and one that I hope we see explored soon. Gollum so far has only made it into the game as his bad side, but he does spend a decent amount of time as a more helpful character, and it would perhaps be remiss to miss this out. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90156-wierd-things-you-would-like-to-see-in-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=865873","commentId":865873,"userName":"Rainelotr","timestamp":1379120655,"content":"Again if he were a hero it should be as Smeagol, not Golum.
