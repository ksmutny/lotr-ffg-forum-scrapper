It's clear from Tolkien's writings that the Goblins of the Misty Mountains (and many other orc groups) had culture, and it stands to reason that therefore they would also have stories, too. Biter and Beater likely earned a legendary reputation as part of some Goblin epic tale from the First Age, much like we would hear about the Trojan Horse or Excalibur, perhaps. Keep in mind that cultures with oral traditions could keep very detailed memories alive, as well, so it's not that unlikely that if these swords had become part of the Goblin Legendarium that they would be recognizable from their descriptions. Especially with the tell-tale blue glow. It's also possible that the swords had been in the possession of the Goblins for some time before the trolls got hold of them, so they might have had more recent direct experience with them (like how Elrond kept the shards of Narsil in Rivendell on display for generations)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289352-roster-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=3662883","commentId":3662883,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1553932295,"content":"This sounds very logical.
