Any progress made by the encounter deck or an encounter card effect (like Soldier of Isengard's) would be placed on the active location first.\n\nEdited April 26, 2015 by Chris51261"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174240-soldier-of-isengard/?do=findComment&comment=1595545","commentId":1595545,"userName":"Veve7","timestamp":1430149842,"content":"Thank you!"}]}
