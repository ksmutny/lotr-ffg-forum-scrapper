I was wondering though: How do you guys think the Blue Wizards should be made? I was thinking they could be kind of like Elladan and Elrohir, benefiting if their counterpart is present, but that seems too predictable. What abilities do you think they should have? Also, while we're talking about them, how do you think Radagast should look if he was ever made into a hero?  :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98796-making-custom-blue-wizards/?do=findComment&comment=978592","commentId":978592,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1391893935,"content":"They won't be made as heroes... so the point is mute."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98796-making-custom-blue-wizards/?do=findComment&comment=978643","commentId":978643,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1391897344,"content":"Of course they won't...

If I was going about making them, I'd probably focus on the fact that they were sent into the East to counter Sauron's influence over the people there. Maybe they could have an ability that could persuade an enemy to turn away from Sauron, helping clear the off the board in a way that was different from combat (perhaps a bonus if they have Harad or Easterling trait?)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98796-making-custom-blue-wizards/?do=findComment&comment=978736","commentId":978736,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1391903235,"content":"Untitled_1.jpg [http://s15.postimg.org/kbih9lp63/Untitled_1.jpg]image.jpg [http://s18.postimg.org/egy2jsmp5/image.jpg]\n\n \n\nOk here you go.. this is my Version of a Gandalf Hero... it is double sided.\n\n \n\nI wanted a way to represent the change in form of Gandalf.... This will be a theme when / if I do other wizards. Note the change in faction Icon as well as a change in traits. I also wanted his stats to be == to his ally counter parts.. other wise why would you not just use them. Still as they are so powerful the card has a huge weight on it. Still with cleaver deck building you can keep him around a long time. This was another goal of the card, to have it retain that \"coming and going\" feeling of the Ally version. I also didn't want the card to have the istar trait as that tutor card is to bonkers to have active for a entire game.\n\nEdited February 9, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98796-making-custom-blue-wizards/?do=findComment&comment=978770","commentId":978770,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1391904780,"content":"Nice idea, a two-side hero card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98796-making-custom-blue-wizards/?do=findComment&comment=978852","commentId":978852,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1391909477,"content":"Don't you collect resources during the Resource phase?

An effect that prevents a hero from collecting resources prevents both methods of acquiring new resources.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nSo you would have to phrase it as \"Gandalf, The White does not collect resources during the resource phase\" for it to work as you express it.\n \nAlso text on Bifur does not allow you to add resources to other heroes:\nAction: Pay 1 resource from a hero's resource pool to add 1 resource to Bifur's resource pool. Any player may trigger this ability. (Limit once per round.)\n \nEDIT: and Gandalf isn´t one of the blue wizards.
