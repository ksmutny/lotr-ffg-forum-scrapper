The idea behind this is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements as outlined in this first post. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any narrative you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. Throughout the week, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results.\n\nWill you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out.\n\nAfter the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. Further, and in general, please refrain from using this thread for extensive theorizing and/or conversation that is not directly related to this particular tournament. Nothing against other conversations – it’s just, that’s what other threads are for. And now… on to this week’s Tournament of the Week!\n\nTournament #1: Journey Down the Anduin [1 Core Set Only] [solo Play]\n\nThis week’s tournament is inspired by Marlow’s recent desire [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=577637&efpag=0] to absolutely conquer the Anduin. While playing Solo, using only one deck made from one core set may not be everyone’s cup of tea, defined parameters are what will make each Tournament of the Week a unique and specific challenge. I hope you enjoy it, and Quest Well!!\n\nTop Ten (11/20/11 – 11/26/11) [sAMPLE POST - NOT FOR OFFICIAL USE]\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=556791","commentId":556791,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1321476289,"content":"Does the requirement \"one core set only\" absolute, i.e. no cards from adventure packs?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=556795","commentId":556795,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1321476869,"content":"Angus Lee said:\n\n \n\nDoes the requirement \"one core set only\" absolute, i.e. no cards from adventure packs?\n\n \n\n \n\nGood question.

The particular quest for this week's tournament would be Journey Down the Anduine (just the one quest), and the deck building restriction would be that you'd be limited to tackling that quest using a deck with cards built just from one core set. What do you mean by \"only have 4 quests to go at?\"\n\nEvery time there is a different weekly tournament, there would be a specific quest chosen for the tournament - just one (unless for that week the tournament happened to be a \"nightmare\" variant or some such). Can you let me know if I need to make a certain part of the instructions more clear? I will make a couple small fixes to the sample posted above, and hopefully that will help (Specifically, I will strike \"as outlined in this first post.\" from the second sentence.)\n\nThanks for the feedback. My hope is to have the instructions for participating as clearly laid out as possible before launching the first one. So, all questions are helpful. Sharing your understanding of how this would work based on what I've written would be helpful too.

And what about 2,3,4-players games? I don't play solo. Only 2 players games with my wife.\n\n\n\nGood question. I've been toying around with a few options...\n\n1) Different weekly tournament formats could specifically be for either solo, 2, 3, or 4 player games. By making each tournament very specific it would either give people a natural out from participating that week (i.e. \"well, I don't play solo, so I'm out\") or it could encourage people to try something new (i.e. \"okay, I'll give this solo thing a go\" or \"I'm gonna need to find a buddy to play with this week if I want in on this weeks tournament\").\n\n2) I could make a separate Top Ten list for each Solo, 2 player, 3 player, and 4 player each week. (That has me spinning a bit just thinking about it though.)\n\n3) Each week could offer Top Tens for both Solo and 2 player formats (maybe the most popular formats at this point?) (also, maybe a little more manageable for me).\n\n4) Some other possibility I'm not thinking of...\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning toward option one at this point, making each tournament very specific around 3 main variables:\n\n1) The Quest for that Week\n\n2) The Deck Building Parameters\n\n3) The Number of Players\n\nBUT, I'm really open to feedback about all of this. What do you think about these options? My desire is to brainstorm, problem-solve on the front end, launch the first tournament this Sunday, see out that goes, evaluate, and continue from there based on how things go.\n\n \n\n[Also, Kiwina - I saw your post too... glad you're game!]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=557099","commentId":557099,"userName":"Trantor3","timestamp":1321545135,"content":"I decided to give this a go tonight. I threw together a Spirit/Leadership deck with Eowyn, Dunhere and Theodred as the heroes. The first game had Unexpected Courage, Sneak Attack and Gandalf in the opening hand - how can it get any better? However, due to Necromancer's Reach, Eowyn eventually bit the dust in the second phase, and I couldn't muster enough quest power after that. I conceded the game shortly after.\nSo, on to a second game. I had Gandalf in my opening hand, but no Sneak Attack this time. I eventually drew it and decided to use it on Faramir so I didn't lose the quest somewhere in phase 2. The next draw, of course, was Gandalf... In phase 2, I revealed a lot of locations and eventually had to return Northern Tracker tue to a Shadow card as it was my only exhausted ally. I couldn't replay it, had 3 locations in the staging area, was at 45 threat and facing the Marsh Adder. I conceded.\nSo, I was off to the third game. Weirdly, everything went super-smooth in spite of me not drawing Gandalf, Northern Tracker, Sneak Attack or Unexpected Courage. However, I got two quick Guide to Loriens and an early Banks of Anduin. I managed to \"recycle\" the Banks 3 times, staying clear of any more dangerous cards. I dealt with the Troll by chumping with a Snowbourne Scout and using For Gondor! for enough damage. When I finished phase 2 in turn 8, I didn't reveal any more enemies and only had to deal with a Dol Guldur Beastmaster which I could exactly kill. I still had the opportunity to recycle a Greeting of the Galadhrim with my Dwarven Tomb to lower my threat again.\nFinal score: 103 - 8 turns, 25 threat, 1 damage on Eowyn and Theodred each (Necromancer's Reach), 4 victory points from the initial Hill Troll.\nI was pretty lucky as I didn't draw anything really dangerous - no second Troll, no Marsh Adder, no Gladden Fields, no Ufthak. So, I'm not really sure I can do better, at least not without an insane amount of luck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=557146","commentId":557146,"userName":"wraith428","timestamp":1321554505,"content":"I really like this idea.  Could do all sorts of fun concepts.  Three heroes of different spheres for instance.  s  I think you can do solo weeks and non solo weeks.  Two player isn't that hard to play solo if you wanted to.  aAfter that though you need another person or two. \n\n \n\nwRAITH428\n\n \n\np.s. - iF THE FORMATTING LOOKS ODD i APPOLOGIZE.  sOMETHING WRONG WITH MY BROWSER AND HAD TO TYPE THIS BLIND."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=557194","commentId":557194,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1321565686,"content":"Trantor and wraith428...

In case you don't allready know them, they produce a really great bi-weekly podcast (dont worry, you can download mps straight from their blog) on the game. If you dont know them yet and care enough about the game to read and post about in the forum, you absolutely HAVE to check them out. They got a good understanding of the game and they are very talented casters. Seriously, I listen to esport commentary (mostly SC2) basically whenever I can and these guys really hold up to the professional ones.\nThe production is great, the content is interesting and useful and sure as hell theyre entertaining, if not to say funny. I know this is a shameless shoutout, but do not worry. I dont know them personally, I never talked to them, Im not one of them on a fake account. Im just convinced that they could greatly improve the concept of a \"themed tournament week\".\n\nSo how could this work? Basically youd have to figure out the theme and hand it to them (Im sure they are more than willing to provide feedback). In addition to posting it on the forum, they could announce the tournamet style on their podcast, which would make it a 2 week format, which Im absolutely fine with. For me as an almost 30-employed-kindof-guy, a 1 week format would leave me with maybe 1 or 2 evenings of play, which isnt quite so much. During the following podcast they could then proceed to report results from the previous segment, discuss it and call out the next format.\n\nYoud basically reach a much larger audience and could enrichen the whole experience by additional coverage.\n\nSure, its more work for everyone involved. Do they want to do it? Do you like the idea? Absolutely in the dark here. I just really like the sound of it and Im pretty certain that it could be greatly successfull.\n\nAlso, dont forget to report your game results with the help of this http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579185 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579185] thread.

I just read your round by round account on Marlow's thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=577637], and all I have to say is... that's awesome. Well, that's awesome and I'm jealous, but mostly just that's awesome. Now, can you get a repeat performance next week? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\nAs for posting results in the tournaments, I'm envisioning people post at least their Final Score and their Starting Heroes. Whatever someone wants to post beyond that (extra narrative, descriptions of rounds, cards used in their deck, etc...) would be totally up to them. Do you think revealing the Starting Heroes would be too big of a tell? I'm imagining not, but I'm curious what others think...\n\nOthers?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=557970","commentId":557970,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1321791864,"content":"Thoughts about the Top Ten...\n\nI've been thinking. This is a living card game, right? So, why not make a living Top Ten Hall of Fame list for those who participate in multiple The juicebox LoTR LCG Tourmament of the Week tournaments?\n\nHere's how it would work:\n\nHall of Fame placements would be scored as follows: in each weekly tournament, a #1 ranked placement earns the participant 10 points, a #2 ranked placement earns the participant 9 points, a #3 ranked placement earns the participant 8 points, and so on all the way down to a #10 ranked placement earning the participant 1 solitary point. After the completion of this first weekly tournament, I will start a separate thread that will house the Top Ten Hall of Fame.\n\nSo, feel free to post multiple successes in each weekly tournament. Theoretically, someone could score as many as 55 points (occupying all ten spots of a weekly Top Ten final result) in one week toward their Top Ten Hall of Fame ranking. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=557986","commentId":557986,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1321798193,"content":" Gotta say, I don't think allowing multiple placements of the same person in one tournament is a good idea.

Your thoughts are important to me, as I do hope to craft the tournaments to be as inclusive as possible while also striving to focus on the natural diversity that is built in to the game - there's just so many different ways to enjoy it! While I may not hit the nail on the head every time, especially given the lack of certain cards in certain markets, rest assured that my plan at this point really is to start oldest to newest (and Mighty Jim, your scaling idea for the Mirkwood cycle is almost exactly along the lines of what I've been imagining for this first run through). Also, I had imagined hosting a Massing at Osgiliath tournament sooner than later, but LEGA, to at least help with some of the market delay issues (again, I probably won't be on a satisfactory pace for everyone with all of them), I'm now considering at least delaying that one for a while.\n\nAlso, since there are currently 10 quests released (US side of the pond) and the flow of new quests being added to our pool from FFG will be monthly, a weekly tournament will mean getting to revisit quests (with different parameters each time) often (especially here in the early days). So, if someone misses playing a certain quest the first time it appears as a focus for a weekly tournament (either because you are playing the game already but don't have the cards yet or because someone has yet to join the game until next week/month/year), rest assured - that quest will eventually be back. Now, while this won't necessarily help create even parity for the ongoing/living nature of the All Time Top Ten, it will at least (hopefully) allow all players to take a crack at a given quest for a weekly tournament at some point along the way.\n\nHope this helps...

I find myself thinking some more about the issue of timing. OnkelZorni, your last aside highlights something that might be very useful for us all - the forums ARE set to FFG Headquarters time. Very interesting. Very interesting, indeed. This has me rethinking my statement above about basing these tournaments around Seattle time. IF we all base it around the FFG Headquarters time, we can all see the date and time of our posts right there in the forum threads. (And whose to say I'll always be in Seattle when it's time for the week to turn over anyway?) So, after all, I think it would be simpler for me, and I think it would be simpler for everyone to make the cutoff time each week at midnight FFG time, as marked by the forums themselves.\n\nSince I did not specify this for the first week's tournament, I may have to offer a little wiggle room if any last minute (Seattle time) posts come in for this first week. BUT, from this week on, we can use FFG time, and I'll specify that in the weekly tournament introduction.\n\nThanks again for bringing this to my attention.\n\nAlso, on another note, GOOD STUFF leptokurt!

Important questions have been raised, and there have been some helpful discussions along the way. Now, while I imagine that the nature of how these tournaments are hosted will continue to evolve somewhat over time, what follows here are some key decisions that will help give shape to the foreseeable future. More precisely, I’m going to go with the following plan for the next 2 months and evaluate whether I will make any further adjustments to the system toward the end of January 2012.\n\nDecisions:\n\n1) Various Solo Player tournaments will continue to be offered weekly on a Sunday – Saturday basis.\n\n2) There will be occasional planned breaks from the weekly Solo Player tournaments, and anticipated breaks will be announced ahead of time in the Ideas Thread.\n\n3) Various 2 Player tournaments will be offered in the form of a monthly tournament (see here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582949] for the current active 2 Player tournament).\n\n4) The frequency of future 2 Player tournaments may be adapted over time to meet the perceived level of interest in 2 Player tournaments, interest being measured by how quickly a competitive Top Ten begins to take shape during a given tournament. (i.e. where one week seemed too short for 2 Player, one month may prove too long.)\n\n5) I am going to start posting weekly announcements (each Wednesday) about upcoming tournaments here to the Ideas Thread. That way, participants can start planning ahead for the next tournament, clarifying questions can be asked, and fine-tuning can be accomplished before the official tournament start date.\n\n6) It is possible that a 3 and/or 4 Player tournament could be hosted at some point in the future. However, logistics have not been thoroughly considered, so plans for hosting such a tournament will likely follow at least a couple of 2 Player events.\n\n7) The juicebox Top Ten Hall of Fame thread will continue to feature one Top Ten Hall of Fame list that highlights the ten highest compiled scores from all completed tournaments.

This break will serve 2 purposes.\n\n1) I want to allow some more focused time to take the active 2 Player tournament for a spin. I know several of you, myself included, have had the desire to play in this tournament but have yet to find the time to enjoy a 2 player gaming session.

I think something like this would be a great challenge for the next time I run a tournament for Passage through Mirkwood.

Maybe. Though if it's open build one could use Song of Kings and SoG on any hero.\n\nOne option could be to allow a participant to rank multiple times in the top ten that week as long as it is with a hero from a different sphere than they already used to rank with. Do you think that would encourage more experimentation? Then again, that could \"over value\" that particular tournament.\n\nRestricting number of heroes does seem like a good concept to play around with at some point.  And PtM seems like a good quest for it.\n\nMaybe using just 2 heroes would be a better place to start.

Super glad you're playing and having fun. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\nThanks too for the great ideas. Limiting the amount of times a scenario can be played is quite intriguing to me. At this point, I'll likely keep things consistent with how they have been for the upcoming handful of tournaments (Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle), but then it may be time to shake things up a bit. And your idea has a lot of potential to play with. Perhaps players could be limited to 3 chances per set of heroes? So, if you've used a particular set of heroes 3 times, you have to switch at least one out (and then get another 3 chances with that new combo), and so on. That way, people could continue to deck build and play many times throughout the week, but they would be \"forced\" to try new things (not just the same powerful combo of heroes over and over until the \"perfect\" run of cards strikes). Perhaps a strict rule about repeated mulligans could be worked into this way of doing things as well - to make each chance more meaningful. In any case, all this is to say - great idea. I'm going to consider something like it for a future tournament cycle.\n\n[That said, I'd specifically like to welcome other feedback around this particular idea over the coming weeks.]\n\nAs to your second idea, have you checked out the Hall of Fame? There's a link to it in my signature. Kind of captures what you're suggesting but will include every Top Ten tournament result over time for every tournament hosted. Should get more and more interesting as time goes on.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the solid feedback. I agree with you about the greatness of this community.

It's one I wrestled with myself for a while. I made some posts on the topic early in the month of December and weighed options, soliciting feedback at that time for about two weeks before coming to a final decision. In the end, I decided to go with one overall compilation ranking system for the Top Ten Hall of Fame. For players currently like you and me (I'm in the same boat... only got in about four 2 player games during the entire month of December - just fortunate enough to have won one of them) it puts us at a disadvantage. On the other hand, it also motivates me to teach my friends this game and to seek out more opportunities to enjoy this game in a face to face social context (which in the long run will hopefully be good, both in general and for tournament play). Anyway, my decision landed with the compiled version of the Top Ten in order to purposefully advantage those who play the game in both its solo and multiplayer forms. Since the game was designed for both, I wanted to honor that. It's a cool part of the game design. Plus, I may want to start hosting 3 and 4 player tournaments at some point, and then I could imagine needing to create 4 separate Top Tens to follow the same line of thinking. Also, in general, it's less work for me to organize one overall Top Ten listing, and I want to make sure that I plan all this in a way that will help to keep it enjoyable for me (minimizing the tedious aspects of hosting) so that I can continue to host for a long time - to set it up to be more sustainable.\n\nThat said, there is nothing keeping someone (yourself or anyone else that would like to) from creating a thread that would feature multiple overall Top Ten rankings for Solo Player, Multiplayer, and whatever other ways of ranking that people dream up. Really, I've considered that it would be cool to have a ranking based on points per tournament (reflecting percentages or something) to give players newer to my tournament system the satisfaction of achieving a high rank even though it will take them a while to catch up (on the current ranking) with those of us who have been playing every tournament possible from the beginning. Anyway, I think that's a fun idea too. I just don't have the energy for it right now. But, if someone wanted to create that, all the data lies in the various tournament threads. It's just up to whether someone wants to take the initiative. They (you, if you want to do it) would have my blessing.\n\nThanks for your thoughts and for playing in and enjoying the tournaments. Your enjoyment shows, and it makes this game more fun for all of us. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=574832","commentId":574832,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1325698544,"content":"Wednesday Announcement: January 4, 2012\n\nThe next planned Solo Player Tournament will continue our venture through the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle.

Juicebox,\n\n \n\nThanks again for running these tourneys.  I am having a blast competing with other players.  \n\n \n\nUnfortunately, this week's tourney has rewarded luck and repetition more than all else.  Sure, the guys who came up with the creative deck-building solutions to beating this quest deserve to be rewarded for it.  But I, like so many others, spent most of my time shuffling, drawing new starting hands, and then getting destroyed by the \"unlucky\" encounters.  Unfortunately, after A LOT of tries, I never had that perfect storm come around so I didn't even get to post a score.  But I was planning on writing a post on this thread even if I had managed to get a good score.  \n\n \n\nThere is too much riding on repetition and luck, and not enough on initial deck build and creative game play.  If number of tries were limited, we would all have to think a lot more carefully about our deck build, and then we would be forced to play through the hands we drew, which would in turn force us to make good in-game plays in order to salvage the best score possible, even when there is bad luck.  In my opinion, this would be a better representation of who the better players are because, even though some will still get those lucky runs, the odds will even things out in the long run.  \n\n \n\nIt might be too late to implement some type of rule like this for the remainder of the Mirkwood Cycle, but perhaps after that something could change.  May I suggest you raise awareness of this idea to see if anyone else feels as I do.  If it turns out that I'm not the only one who would like a change, perhaps there can be some good discussion and maybe even some voting on rules.  I certainly don't claim to have the best solution for this situation, but I'm sure that as a community we can come up with a good compromise that can keep most everybody happy and having fun.\n\n \n\n~Vase"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=576335","commentId":576335,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1326008490,"content":"Vase, et.al.,\n\nSo, in reading your note, I both agree and disagree. \n\nI was one of those guys with a sub-30 score, but if you read the whole tournement log, you'll note I started out at 92.  Then 65, 52, 37, 33, 31, and finally 28.  I did play a ton of games and the perfect storm certainly has to brew to a point.  However, this week I learned a lot about some cards I never fully understood, (PoL in particular).  Before Wraith's 23, I thought the best score I could get was a 25 and that was getting 6 particular cards out of 11, (using 1x Sneak Attack on Gandalf to get an extra 3 cards during the game), and when that was managed, it just didn't work out.  Then he goes and throws Bilbo instead of Glorfindel and I think, Bilbo?  Really?  So I keep my whole deck, except make this one switch and all of a sudden my possibilities open up a little more.  Finally, a 28. Bilbo is more useful than I thought.\n\nAll this to say, I have really learned a lot through the tournaments, but in order to keep up with everyone else who understands the game a lot better and has played longer, I have had to play a lot, and really hard at times to keep in the fray!  If I was limited to how many games I could play for the tournament, I am not sure if my overall gameplay would have improved as much as it has as well as deck building skills.  For example, the same deck I used this past week for JtR, I also used with another person in a 2 player tournement for Mirkwood, and we took it out 2 games out of 3 and had the lowest score until yesterday.  (Not that there are that many scores posted mind you!)\n\nOn the other hand, I do agree with you that limiting the amount of games one can play to post a score would level the playing field a bit because it would make us think more and force us to play through as you said.\n\nOverall though, if we were to do that, I think you would want to start out that rule change with something like, \"In this tournament you are limited to 25 game attempts.\"  And then maybe start to decrease it from there over time.\n\nHope that all makes sense!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=576423","commentId":576423,"userName":"Vase","timestamp":1326020726,"content":"Zjb12

little time for playing games.  I have to fit games in somewhere because otherwise my brain would explode and I would burn out from never having any kind of fun :)

one out and everyone likes the tourneys like this, then that is fine.  I'll just deal with it as best I can and still have fun.  I just think it is a bit extreme though, and the tourneys could do a little more to help the gameplay be more fun and a little less serious.  Of course, this is just my opinion and I understand if people disagree.  I certainly have nothing against serious competitiveness...except that I can't always participate in it :)

I don't say I am all against this, but in the extreme case this could reduce the game to just trying over and over again to draw the right cards instead of actually PLAYING the game.\n\nOne way to reward more consistent decks (and also mitigate the luck of draw) would be to have to play two or three games in a row and then either add up the scores or calculate the average. In this regard a fail could either equal a certain number of (high) points (which could be tricky since the average scores for each scenario are very different) or simply mean a fail (ie you would have to succeed in all games to get a valid entry).\n\nIn order to reward decks that are not overly scenario specific you could do as above but play DIFFERENT scenarios. You could even use some kind of \"Nightmare rules\" linking the games together, as long as it doesn't become too complicated (else it becomes easier to make mistakes and it might also scare people away if nightmare rules are too complex).\n\nOne drawback with both these suggestions is of course that it would take more playings to get a valid tournament entry, and I know that time is precious for many of us (I have three kids myself and do most of my gaming late in the evening/past midnight), but I really like the idea of linking different scenarios together somehow. I don't know what other people think though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=579701","commentId":579701,"userName":"Vase","timestamp":1326626701,"content":"Fatty said:\n\nOne way to reward more consistent decks (and also mitigate the luck of draw) would be to have to play two or three games in a row and then either add up the scores or calculate the average.

Theres a 50:50 chance that you will get one UC in your starting had which allows you to draw 5 cards. Soon afterwards you'll have the second UV etc - you'll have your complete deck drawn in less than 10 rounds. In the meanwhile you start to play GG and Gandalf's, you get them back by using Will of the West, so your threat will be down to 0, you'll have SoG and tons of cards - how is this not broken? If you don't believe it, use muemakan's deck and try it yourself. Once you get UC you have almost won the game.\n\n \n\nI know people say that Glaurung sounds like a broken record, and I myself don't agree with everything he says, but in this case he's totally right. Beravor doesn't have to be banned though, it would be enough to limit her ability to once per round, similar to Glorfindel's healing ability."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=588320","commentId":588320,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1328101206,"content":"AGoT has the rule that no player can draw more than 3 additional cards in addition to their normal draw per round.. perhaps a rule like that would be appropriate for this game?  (And an effect that \"puts cards into your hand\" doesn't count as \"drawing\".)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=588341","commentId":588341,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1328103133,"content":"radiskull said:\n\nAGoT has the rule that no player can draw more than 3 additional cards in addition to their normal draw per round.. perhaps a rule like that would be appropriate for this game?  (And an effect that \"puts cards into your hand\" doesn't count as \"drawing\".)\n\n\n\n \n\nSounds fine to me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=588342","commentId":588342,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1328103537,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\nradiskull said:\n\n \n\nAGoT has the rule that no player can draw more than 3 additional cards in addition to their normal draw per round.. perhaps a rule like that would be appropriate for this game?  (And an effect that \"puts cards into your hand\" doesn't count as \"drawing\".)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSounds fine to me.\n\n\n\nI guess I want to see/hear something decisive from FFG, otherwise, we're just making up our own house rules."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=588359","commentId":588359,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1328104435,"content":"juicebox said:\n\nleptokurt said:\n\n \n\nradiskull said:\n\n \n\nAGoT has the rule that no player can draw more than 3 additional cards in addition to their normal draw per round.. perhaps a rule like that would be appropriate for this game?  (And an effect that \"puts cards into your hand\" doesn't count as \"drawing\".)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSounds fine to me.\n\n \n\n \n\nI guess I want to see/hear something decisive from FFG, otherwise, we're just making up our own house rules.\n\n\n\nUhm, we just changed the scoring system, but we will not have our own house rules in non-official tournaments, even if they make a lot of sense?\n\n \n\nWE HAVE TO END BERAVOR'S RULE OF TERROR!\n\n \n\nOr, to say it with Kant:\n\nEnlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity.

When I consider setting up that framework, however, one of the goals I have personally is that it would facilitate playing the game as it is - or as it evolves (as designed by FFG). All available scenarios and cards represented, following all FFG rules and FAQ updates. I would hope that someone who has never played the game before would be able to purchases a core set, add some adventure packs if they wish, come to this site, and be able to jump right in the fun of a Living Tourney scene.\n\nIn my opinion, there are enough rules to learn in the game to have to further consider additional restrictions - and come to an understanding of why those restrictions where established. And that second part seems to be the bigger deal. We are all operating under limited insight as to how this games works and doesn't work (including the game designers), but if cards are to be banned for an ongoing system of tournaments that is set up to facilitate building decks from the entire available card pool, I want for the game designers to be the ones to make that call. That's kind of their job, as how I see it.\n\nYes, submitting scores in Sets of 3 (or whatever the final decision is regarding number of games in a Set) would be in addition to the expressed FFG rules. However, in my mind, we are simply creating a tool for helping to more satisfactorily rank player results in comparison with one another. Further, players would not have to do their own math to calculate their final meta/weighted score... they would just play three games and report the results. I want it to appear simple - even though we all (those of us who have been active in these discussions up to this point) know it's been a complicated road getting to this point.\n\nIf FFG changes the scoring system again (like they have already done once) or initiate a new rule (limited drawing mechanic for example) or create a banned list (ahem, Beravor), then we'll have to discuss at that point how that would impact our Living Tournament system, but I imagine that certain posted results in the Living Tournament system would need to be invalidated at that point or at least *'d with a note that the particular result came before the change.\n\n2) That said, I'm also wanting to continue to offer juicebox Tournaments. I primarily view these tournaments as a way to experiment with various scenarios - placing interesting parameters and restrictions and what not. Recently, the tournaments have been a fairly straightforward \"restricted\" run through of the SoM cycle. I wanted to run that through to its conclusion for continuity and to learn together from the play-as-published experience. However, I have some ideas (thanks to great input from this online community) for future tournaments that would be more highly based around certain themes and would hopefully offer new twists on old scenarios. I see timed tournaments (a week, a month, or a weekend - like Zjb12's recent events) as ideal settings for exploring various interesting restrictions, theme tournaments, nightmare variants, etc... we are really only limited by our imagination. This is the setting in which I would want to experiment with various \"house rules.\" Some juicebox Tournaments (especially the more experimental ones) may turn out as a flop, a great success, or somewhere in between. The fun (for me) will be in the trying, the discovering, and the sharing in that process together.\n\nThe tricky part (as I mentioned above) is that for this month, I wanted to offer a few almost \"open build\" tournaments with the main variable being the # of games played in a Set in order to get a feel for how that is experienced as a tournament mechanic. For anyone who's interested in giving it a try, the feedback will be quite helpful in \"play testing\" this mechanic in preparation for settling on a Living Tournament structure. Also, the first juicebox Tournament for Solo Player featured Journey Down the Anduin with only one Core Set allowed - so this will be a very different play experience.\n\nAll that said, I think the concerns about Beravor and the current FFG rulebook are quite valid. I hope it's on FFG's radar. In setting up future juicebox Tournaments (like from March onward, specifically), it will certainly be on mine."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=588724","commentId":588724,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1328164322,"content":"Memetix said:\n\nAs it stands, as muemakan has consistently shown, you win the tournaments with a deck that reduces your threat to 0 in about 10 turns.

After they change.\n\n1 step 1 game for each team.Best scores win. Then next step  you can get anoter team as opponent, if you win you get another team who is also win so your judgment with every step will be more proff. And losers play with losers.

He used cards that you made up a restricted card listwith a house rule (which is why by your own standards all of the results of your tournament are useless).

(We'll see how the discussion goes... I'm curious if anyone who actually plays in the Sets of 3 format ends up wishing it were organized in Sets of 4 or Sets of 5 - for the sake of a better experience, more balanced outcomes, etc... I guess I'm specifically looking for that kind of feedback after actual play experience before I feel good about offering a tournament that asks for Sets of 4 or Sets of 5, as my bias is clearly for Sets of 3, but I'm trying to remain open minded while looking for some general consensus.)\n\n3) Khazad-dûm!!!

I can't really justify calling this a Wednesday Announcement, as Wednesday is just too far gone.\n\nI do want to share a few thoughts though:\n\nMy sense from the forums, both from those who have enjoyed the player created tournament scene and those who don't, is that we may be experiencing a bit of tournament burn-out around here. That combined with the frustrating reality of the lack of content categories for these forums (meaning threads fall off the front page faster than you can start raking in the resources from a sprightly constructed Ziggy deck) has me feeling the need to take a little break from hosting a next Solo Player Tournament. The break may just be for a week, maybe a couple weeks... let's see how it goes.\n\nIn the mean time, in terms of evaluating possibilities for a new Living Tournament system, from the feedback there has been over the last couple of tournaments I have run as well as the ones that Zjb12 has run requiring results be posted in Sets, it seems that Sets of 3 is the way to go. I find it meaningful to have this feedback offered after playing through the tournaments. Feedback based out of experience is more meaningful than feedback based out of theory. So, for those of you who have offered your thoughts on the experience of playing games in Sets, thank you. If there's anything that's been left unsaid, feel free to chime in here. And another note about the Living Tournament scene... I've had some meaningful conversation with Darksbane over at CardgameDB about possibilities for hosting them there at some point. Also, there has been some initiatives to get forum categories going here. In either case, I'd like to wait a bit for a more ideal interface to exist before launching something like that. Once that's in place (whether it's on CardgameDB, here, or somewhere else - whatever reasonably comes together first), I think it will be quite excellent and fun and very much worth the wait for a quality Living Tournament experience.\n\nAfter a break, the next juicebox Solo Player Tournaments will likely be quite thematic. Looking forward to those after some rest.\n\nAs always, thanks for playing,\n\njuicebox"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56379-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournaments-ideas-thread-now-moved-to-player-community-subforum/?do=findComment&comment=595771","commentId":595771,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1329581854,"content":"Thank your veeeeryyyyyyyyyyyy much for hosting these tournaments, Juicy!
