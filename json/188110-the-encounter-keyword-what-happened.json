Whats more even though the event would now cost 0 and would see far more play it doesn't really make the card THAT much better because if you don't have any resources when he appears during staging (spend them all during planning) then you can't pay for and obtain him so it would actually have an additional drawback if they designed it like this.\n\nSo no initial cost and investment that may never pay off. Only the cardspace in your deck.\n\nstill costs 1 but you only have to spend that when the ranger appears. Built in drawback that you may not be able to pay for him/you need to save at least one resource if you know a Ranger of the North might appear.\n\n \n\nso it makes you think about using resources more carefully, actually adds a drawback to the card but makes it far more playable and just all round seems like a far better design. I'm actually fairly boggled now why they did not design it like this...\n\n \n\nI guess they really wanted to include the drawback of having to spend a resource and not knowing if you will actually even get \n\nanything back for it.... which yes is in leadership which has plenty of resource acceleration but you usually want to play this card within the first few turns (or at certain strategic points like right before the encounter deck is going to get reshuffled and has almost run out) at which point even a single resource can be critical so using one on something you may never see can be very hard to justify. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188110-the-encounter-keyword-what-happened/?do=findComment&comment=1953857","commentId":1953857,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1450928260,"content":"Just have Ranger of the North say something like:\n\nWhen Revealed: The players as a group may spend X (up to 4) Leadership resources to deal X damage to an enemy in play or place X progress on a location in play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188110-the-encounter-keyword-what-happened/?do=findComment&comment=1954097","commentId":1954097,"userName":"Sin21","timestamp":1450948269,"content":"Build a scrying deck with RotN, Minas Tirith Lampwright and Palantir/Scout ahead/Risk some Light and you are in for some fun ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nGood for Multiplayer.
