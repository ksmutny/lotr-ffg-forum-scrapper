All other decks builders suck in comparison.\n\nFor me, the deck builder has to be online or be built to work with OCTGN, including pulling its data from the OCTGN database on my computer. Online allows me the flexibility to build decks from anywhere without needing to install an app and that keeps he decks all in one accessible place.\n\nIf I'm going to use an installed app, then I need access to OCTGN's database on my computer because I often \"proxy\" spoiled cards, and I also need the deck files to be usable by OCTGN in order for me to not need to manually recreate the deck in OCTGN in order to use it.\n\nSo no matter how good that deck builder is, if it doesn't fit those criteria, it isnt worth it. Not for me anyway.\n\nEdited June 26, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109446-cardgamedb-new-deck-builder/?do=findComment&comment=1137396","commentId":1137396,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1404061750,"content":"Tried to create an account on CardGameDB yesterday to check out the deck builder tools, but still have not received the validation e-mail that was supposed to be sent, even though after a few hours I made another request that it be sent.
