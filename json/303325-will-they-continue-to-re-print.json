I have no idea.  I'm not terribly optimistic, but I suspect so are all who live to see such times..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303325-will-they-continue-to-re-print/?do=findComment&comment=3863872","commentId":3863872,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1578416768,"content":">

it's good to keep the game in the public eye.  But does anyone really need it?  I've been playing this game for over a year now, and I'm just now finishing up the third cycle (plus I did the first

sure people are tired of me saying this in multiple threads, but when they announced the hiatus I aggressively pushed very hard to complete my desired collection. I have no confidence that the game comes back the same way, if at all, after the hiatus. Reinforced in my mind by no Fellowship event in 2019. I'd mention today's announced closing of FFI but I don't see that as related (yet). At 9 cycles (second only to AGOT's 12) the game has run a good life. Even the characters and cards coming out in this latest cycle imply to me that the game is wrapping up.\n\n> On 12/12/2019 at 5:18 PM, 4wallz said:\n> \n> I still need stuff to complete my collection, a lot of stuff, and I'd hate to pay scalper prices.  I'd rather wait for re-prints.  Thanks!\n\nI think you will see reprints: FFG Store, Miniature Market, Amazon, Legendesque. Start watching each of those sites daily and be financially prepared to get what you want when it becomes available. I don't see them not doing reprints as this game's expansions (especially certain ones) sell out as fast as they can print them.\n\nEdited January 8 by TheSpitfired\nclarification"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303325-will-they-continue-to-re-print/?do=findComment&comment=3904294","commentId":3904294,"userName":"rogertravisjr","timestamp":1582915877,"content":"Khazad-Dum is back in stock in the FFG store as of now.
