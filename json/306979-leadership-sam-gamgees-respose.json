He gets +1[all stats] until the end of the round.\n\nNormally I would quest with Sam, but in this case I was trying to avoid Bill Ferny's forced ability, and so where possible I was only questing with Frodo and allies.\n\nSo my question is: if I optionally engage an enemy (with engagement cost higher than my threat) while Sam is ready, does he still gain the stat boost?\n\nI don't think it really mattered while I was playing last night as I had plenty of options for dealing the engaged enemies, but would like clarification, just in case it comes up again.\n\nÂ "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306979-leadership-sam-gamgees-respose/?do=findComment&comment=3915939","commentId":3915939,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1584532779,"content":"Yes, you still get the boost even if Sam is ready.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306979-leadership-sam-gamgees-respose/?do=findComment&comment=3915960","commentId":3915960,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1584538757,"content":"[source is the FAQ, reproduced here:Â http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Card914 [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Card914]]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306979-leadership-sam-gamgees-respose/?do=findComment&comment=3916044","commentId":3916044,"userName":"steve83","timestamp":1584547551,"content":"Thanks for that!
