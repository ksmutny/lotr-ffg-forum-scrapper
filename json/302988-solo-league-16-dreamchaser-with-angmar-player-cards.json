This month we'll be playing three sailing quests from the Dreamchaser cycle. The quests are:\n\n1) Voyage Across Beleagar\n2) Flight of the Stormcaller\n3) Storm Over Cobas Haven\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n1) Each player will construct a 50+ card deck, then use that exact deck against all three quests. You may use that deck freely against any quests (include the three quests in the league) prior to the run for testing purposes, but you may not use any trial runs for your official results.\n\n2) At least one of the heroes must be from a box with those quests. This means that you must have at least one of Cirdan, Galdor, Leadership Denethor, and Na'asiyah.\n\n3) Your score against each quest will be how much help you need to defeat it, based on the Grace of the Valar variant invented by Seastan. It works like this:\n\nFor each token you have, after you draw/mulligan your initial hand you can choose to draw a card or give a hero a resource. This happens one at a time, so if I use my first token to draw a card, I see the card before I decide whether to use my second token for a card or a resource.\n\nThe original variant starts at zero tokens and gains two tokens if you lose quickly (first five turns) and one if you do not -- however, for the purposes of this league I will allow you to start a quest at any number of tokens, and adjust by as many as you want. The only rules for adding/reducing tokens are these:\n\nRule 1) If you lose a quest with X tokens, you cannot play that quest again with X or less tokens.\nRule 2) If you defeat a quest with Y tokens, you cannot play that quest again with Y or more tokens.\n\nSo for example, if I start with six tokens against Voyage Across Beleagar and defeat it, I can play it again with 0-5 tokens. If I then try with three tokens and lose, I can play it again with 4 or 5 tokens. If I try with four and lose, I can play it again with 5 tokens. If I win, my final score for that quest is 5, and if I lose my final score for the quest is 6. (Alternatively, I could've decided that 6 was a good enough score the first time I played it, and just have my final score be 6 without playing again.)\n\nRemember that tokens do not carry over between quests. When playing Storm Over Cobas Haven it does not matter how many tokens I needed to defeat Flight of the Stormcaller.\n\n4) You are not required to publish your deck, but providing a ringsdb link is encouraged (otherwise I may need to ask you for your decklist at the end of the month if required for a tiebreaker). You are required to reveal which Heroes you used, and how many cards in your deck came from outside GH/Dreamchaser, LR/Angmar and a single core. Do not include outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck itself.\n\n5) Tiebreakers have frequently mattered. Here are the tiebreakers, in order:\n---\n1st) The number of outside cards (i.e. not from GH/Dreamchaser, LR/Angmar or a single core) used in the deck. Do not count outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck. Less cards is better.\n\n2nd) The number of heroes specifically from GH/Dreamchaser or LR/Angmar. More is better.\n\n3rd) The number of heroes used from this list: Cirdan, Galdor, LeDenethor, Na'asiyah. More is better.\n\n4th) The number of cards in the deck outside GH/Dreamchaser and LR/Angmar. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n5th) The number of cards outside Grey Havens, Flight of the Stormcaller, and Storm Over Cobas Haven. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n6th) Performance in November's Solo League (if you didn't play or finish September's League, a median performance will be assumed). Whoever did worst wins this tiebreaker.\n---\n\n6) 1st place gets to choose the cycle for February's league, 2nd place gets to choose a quest from that cycle, and 3rd place gets to choose a quest *not* to be used from that cycle. In an effort to expand the diversity of decks used, the last place player will choose an additional cycle that may be used for deckbuilding in February's league. January's cycle will be chosen by the winner of November's league.\n\n7) Weekly deadlines will be on Monday at 11pm Eastern. Only the final deadline really matters for scoring (and can be delayed if requested) -- the first two deadlines are only to be included in intermediate standings.\n\nVoyage Across Beleagar: December 16th\nFlight of the Stormcaller: December 23rd\nStorm Over Cobas Haven: December 30th\n\n8 )  I've created a google spreadsheet for results here: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TK-qLhJh0RDg9r8FyH8tcJ5r-Qtt371GKboZO5AtXIY/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TK-qLhJh0RDg9r8FyH8tcJ5r-Qtt371GKboZO5AtXIY/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nTo join the league, merely add your name and information about your deck to the spreadsheet, then enter your results as you have them. Please give a link to your deck if you built or published it on ringsdb, but it is not required.\n\nIf you wish you may run additional decks against the quests and record your results (I hope to do this), but only the first entry will be considered for the competition itself."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3842438","commentId":3842438,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1575478186,"content":"First two quests down. \n\n \n\nVoyage Across Beleager was rough, I chose Dawn Star as my second ship to help with needed card draw but didn't draw Steward of Gondor until too late to matter, also got location locked as my build was mostly relying on the ships and Sam to do the questing. Which caused me to threat out on the last stage 2. \n\n \n\nSecond try with one token went much much better as I drew Steward and Magic Ring round one and could play them all to turn Na'asiyah into a ship slayer. Boromir was great for the sailing tests as he could always contribute and once I got a few cheap allies out there the Snowbourn Scouts and Honour Guards helped keep my ships on course for the entire game while my ships and Sam power quested and Na'asiyah obliterated any enemies unfortunate enough to pop up. Wait No Longer was also exceptionally helpful to help quest since I could fairly easily dispatch enemies. I was able to Firefoot + Quick Strike with Na'asiyah twice and destroy a southern Sailor and then sink the ship it sailed in on with the excess damage. The thematic win of the queen of the Corsairs defeated other pirates while Boromir helped hoist the sails, quest and fight all in the same round was excellent. Definitely a lot of fun.\n\n \n\nTook on Flight of the Stormcaller and decent starting hand but didn't draw any Gandalf/Sneak attack until phase 3 of the quest. Questing topped out with my two ships and Sam again while my Tactics heroes handled any ships/boarders. It was a very tense finale when I finally caught up to the Stormcaller on stage 4 and engaged it along with a corsair skiff and Swift Raider. I began the final combat phase with my swarm of cheap crewmember allies and fresh heroes taking on the three enemy ships along with the 5 enemy corsairs that boarded, one of which was the Umbar Captain who had to be destroyed before I could attack the Stormcaller. I sacrificed most of my grunts which caused Na'asiyah to gain a resource for each of their deaths as it fueled her anger and retaliation. A Sneak Attacked Gandalf and Boromir attacking in his Raiment of War defeated the Umbar Captain which he then readied and attacked the Stormcaller alongside Elven archers, a Dunedain Hunter, Gandalf and finally Na'asiyah attacking while spending 4 resources to deliver the killing blow and winning the game. One of the most interesting finales of any scenerio I have played and the theme was super rich here. Great sailing quests! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3842540","commentId":3842540,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1575485633,"content":"I found out the hard way how important it is to stay on course haha"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3842589","commentId":3842589,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1575489267,"content":"Those weather cards right!

Very quickly threated out.\n\nNext attempt was another rough go drawing two siege ships in the first round, being off course has seemingly unable to get back on again I proceeded to be pummeled by arrows and lost my heroes shortly after losing again.\n\nTrying again with 4 tokens I was able to acquire 2 Dol Amroth Warships, and then a captured Corsair Skirmisher all fairly early on. I passed every single sailing test even when I only sent as few as two characters. The wind had definitely changed direction with my luck. Using this fleet of 5 ships I was able to take out the Raider Flagship during a prolonged battle on the first stage. Boromir was key to winning being able to hold off attackers while Na'asiyah dispatched a strong enemy or two each round (until Magic Ring got pillaged by a corsair then it was just one). When I got to stage three I realized that I had won by defeating the flagship earlier on. So all in all 4 tokens for this incredibly difficult scenerio was required for my thematic pirate build. Lots of fun using Na'asiyah on quests that feel like they were designed for her.\n\n \n\nTotal tokens for all three quests are 5, rough go haha. I hope all your sea adventures fair better guys."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3843255","commentId":3843255,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1575571880,"content":"I see three attempts described, with the last at four tokens.  Was the second attempt with three tokens?  If not, you may be able to improve your score, if you care to.  If you lost at two tokens (for example) then won at four tokens in your next attempt, you can try again at three."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3849788","commentId":3849788,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1576473793,"content":"Went with a Noldor/Erestor deck for this one - my first ever Erestor deck.\n\nThis one started terribly when I went off course early and had to engage two Scouting Ships. The same turn I decided it was worthwhile to head off course due to Sudden Storms rather than lose half my sailors. This turned out to be a good decision as I managed to get three successes on the sailing test the next turn to get back on course.\n\nI was saved by a fog bank this turn as well, which helped me fend off the ships. Thanks to Explorer's Almanac I was able to manage the threat in staging without clearing away the fog bank for two more turns, allowing me time to build up and dispatch the raiders.\n\nNow it was a sprint to the finish, which thanks to my Noldor army was not too much trouble, especially with Lords of the Eldar to get me over the line on the final stage.\n\nI think this was the most challenging time I have had on this quest since the very first time I tried it, which goes to show you that this game is never boring. Highlights include drawing all three copies of Elrond's Council in my opening hand (the first time this deck has ever been in secrecy, even for a short time) and the fact that three out of four times I was attacked by ships they got +3 attack. Added to some archery damage on the penultimate turn and my fleet (and crew) were in a very sorry state by the end.\n\nThe deck should be good at sailing and since you don't have to engage any enemies in this quest things should have been much smoother (as they were in my practice game). The tweaks I made to the deck to make it more competitive in the other two quests probably helped me to limp through this one under fire for half the time.\n\nI went with Narelenya for the secondary ship as I will for the other two quests because it gives me the necessary boost to get sailors out early. After so much trouble with this quest, I'm a little apprehensive about the next two. Still absolutely love the sailing quests though, some of my favourites for sure.\n\nVoyage Across Beleagar: 0 tokens\n\nEdited December 16, 2019 by rees263"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3850356","commentId":3850356,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1576545409,"content":"Flight of the Stormcaller was a little more forgiving luckily. Once again I got unlucky early on with a sailing test throwing me off course, but the only penalty was two extra progress for the Stormcaller. Overall the enemy progress was slow, taking 4 turns to reach stage 3 and on turn 7 I was able to complete stage 3B and overrun the Stormcaller.\n\nI stalled for a while on stage 2, not helped by a Swift Raider dropping off two Cunning Pirates who stripped me of my To the Sea, to the Sea! By the final turns progress was fast, given that I had 15 allies (+ two ships), including a few that could both sail and quest.\n\nA fun quest, but not too hard if you manage to stay on course. Now on to Cobas Haven, where I will probably need a token or two unless I get an optimal start.\n\nFlight of the Stormcaller: 0 tokens\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3851148","commentId":3851148,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1576648976,"content":"Usually i would choose Seaward Tower for my starting objective in A Storm on Cobas Haven, but this time I went with Tower of the Gull since I should be able to handle sailing anyway and I'd rather minimise combat.\n\nThe first turn was a little disappointing because I was only able to get two allies into play - no To the Sea and no free allies after looking at 13 cards. Still, I got an okay time with the encounter deck, with only a Fog Bank guarding the objective.\n\nI played a very slow game, taking my time on stage one to build up and secure the Tower. This also let me chip away at a Light Cruiser that turned up. By turn three I was sailing with 6 characters so had no problem with the test. Henamarth showed up allowing me to stall for even longer on stage one, time I used to engage and take out a Heavy Cruiser which brought The Beacon along with it. I was also able to commandeer one of the Corsair ships before progressing to stage two - Glorfindel is the perfect ally to use for this effect!\n\nThis stage went by much more quickly, maybe four turns. I had plenty of allies to sail and quest - sailing successes were looking pretty dicey so some rounds I was committing 8-10 to the tests! I had to take out (and take over) another Skirmisher this round, as well as a scouting ship to secure both objectives in play. By now my fleet had grown to 5 with the addition of a Dol Amroth Warship. On reaching 3B the staging area was now completely clear, so I had an easy quest to victory next turn - over 60 potential Willpower on offer. I was fortunate that the only Corsair Warship I encountered was on this final turn.\n\nIn the end I lost count of my turn total, but it must have been around 15 since I got through my own deck almost twice and at least four times for the encounter deck. I also took out two ships entirely by the effect of Tower of the Gull, which was extremely helpful. Thanks to Elrond's Counsel I ended the game with threat still under 30, and that threat control really helped with managing the enemies. I've found in solo especially that dealing with ship enemies can be really punishing, so it was good that I was able to deal with them in my own time.\n\nTotal for december: 0 tokens"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3851518","commentId":3851518,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1576688413,"content":"I’m not in the leagues but this is the quest I’m on, that was helpful to read"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3858466","commentId":3858466,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1577713798,"content":"Sorry for the delay, I've been behind and am also going through the complete Dreamchaser cycle with my son (using the not yet published Dori, LeEomer, and side quests).  I'm extending the league through New Years Day so I can finish up -- this also gives an opportunity to someone who would rather spend the end of the year sailing instead of indulging in holiday frivolity.\n\nThe first quest, Voyage Across Beleagar, isn't considered a widely difficult quest -- unless you don't manage to stay on course.  My first attempt I powered through a stage with bad weather and ended up with the Calaphon's Divination (random stage two) adding a scouting ship, to go with the one that was engaged already and the one that came out in staging -- and both new ships having Boarding 2 thanks to being off course.  Facing three ships and four enemies was beyond my defensive capabilities, so I folded.  The second attempt stayed on course, and had a much easier go of it.  I wasn't the only one who stumbled on the quest (outside cards in parens):\n\n0 rees263 (19)\n0 Thanee (39)\n1 General Grievous (9)\n1 dalestephenson (17)\n\nFlight of the Stormcaller should be a good fit for a good questing deck like the Stereotypical Noldor Deck, but I met with disaster early in it.  Trying to keep Swift Raider in staging because I wasn't able to handle Corsairs yet, I quested with Arwen, Cirdan and Narelenya.  That was the cue for Man Overboard to get revealed, and I couldn't cancel it -- and I didn't think I could survive the loss of Arwen (with To the Sea, To the Sea! attached) or Cirdan (with Light of Valinor and Narya attached).\n\nThe second attempt I was further along in building up my Noldor army when I lost a hero -- I took a two-attack corsair attack undefended so I would have enough attack power to finish off one of the two corsairs engaged me, and it got a +2 attack boost.  I killed off Erestor, since I could toss green cards to Arwen or TTSTTS and soldiered on -- I already had a lot of allies out.  My big break came on stage three -- despite having all three Sahir's Escorts, fair weather and favorable draws left the Stormcaller one progress short of completing stage three when I reached it.  I engaged one of them to get it out of staging, travelled to the Vast Coastland, and the next turn ignoring sailing and set everybody questing, bolstered by a Lords of the Eldar -- I just cleared the third stage for victory.  But I was the only player who needed two tries:\n\n0 General Grievous (9)\n0 rees263 (19)\n0 Thanee (38)\n1 dalestephenson (17)\n\nSo before the final quest the standings are:\n\n0 rees263 (19)\n0 Thanee (38)\n1 General Grievous (9)\n2 dalestephenson (17)\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3861935","commentId":3861935,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1578159272,"content":"I feared the final quest because the Stereotypical Noldor Deck lacked combat power, at least until a couple hefty allies and Narya are out.  I started with three tokens but didn't get TTSTTS to discount allies, and was quickly overwhelmed when I failed to stay on course and scouting ships engaged.  That locked me into last place, but I tried again with 6 tokens, and was able to muster enough combat to clear out Siege Ships and finish stage two -- then an all-out quest, ignoring the weather and using all my spirit resources for Lords of the Eldar, cleared the willpower I needed to clear stage three by two.  Results against Cobas Haven (outside cards in parens):\n\n0 rees263 (19)\n2 Thanee (38)\n4 General Grievous (9)\n6 dalestephenson (17)\n\nFinal Standings:\n\n0 rees263 (19)\n2 Thanee (38)\n5 General Grievous (9)\n8 dalestephenson (17)\n\nrees263 gets to choose the cycle for February, Thanee gets to choose a quest from that cycle, General Grievous gets to exclude a quest from that cycle, and I get to choose a supplementary cycle for player cards.  January's cycle is the Hobbit saga.\n\nrees263 and I both played Erestor decks, and he only had two extra cards from outside.  He had Galdor instead of Cirdan as one of the heroes (we both used Arwen with Erestor).  What other differences were between the decks?\n\nrees263:\n2x Elladan\n2x Elrohir\n3x Elven Jeweler\n1x Galion\n2x Guardian of Rivendell\n1x Henamarth Riversong\n3x Lindon Navigator\n3x Sailor of Lune\n2x Explorer's Almanac\n2x Light of Valinor\n2x Song of Travel\n3x The Hidden Way\n\ndalestephenson:\n1x Elladan\n1x Elrohir\n2x Galdor of the Havens\n3x Guardian of Rivendell\n2x Sailor of Lune\n2x A Burning Brand\n3x Light of Valinor\n3x Narya\n3x Silver Harp\n1x Steward of Gondor\n1x Unexpected Courage\n2x A Test of Will\n3x Daeron's Runes\n\nYou can see that compared to the Såtereotypical Noldor deck, his deck has more allies (essential for sailing), the incredible Hennamarth and the free Galion included, three copies of the sailing kings Lindon Navigator, the fantastic Hidden Way event, and a way to clear nasty locations in staging.  Oh, and player skill might have something to do with his better results too!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302988-solo-league-16-dreamchaser-with-angmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3862359","commentId":3862359,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1578237673,"content":"Looks like it hasn't been chosen for a while, so I'll go with Angmar Awakened for Feb.\n\nI found the deck needed the extra allies for sailing and for combat, especially because I didn't have something like Narya to help with either.
