When I've spoken to the shop, they have said they rely on the main distributor for release dates, and don't always get told if these change, although that could well be down to Maelstrom rather than the distributor.\n\nAnyway I think the UK distributor (Esdevium) is also responsible for Europe, so it may be Fantasiapelit simply haven't got an updated release date?\n\nCould be worth checking with them if you haven't already, to ensure they know the game has been released already. I've done that with Maelstrom a couple of times in the past and then they managed to get hold of my pre-order from the distributor, and ship it a few days later, and updating their release date at the same time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45506-buying-lotr/?do=findComment&comment=456902","commentId":456902,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1303363829,"content":"I think they know. Whenever I inquire about an FFG game, as to when it comes out, all they can say is \"whenever it comes out\", meaning FFG release dates aren't all that accurate from their experience.\n\nI think there have been instances where some UK suppliers order their copies direct from the suppliers/printers, so that those game come straight the UK, instead of making a round trip to FFG first."}]}
