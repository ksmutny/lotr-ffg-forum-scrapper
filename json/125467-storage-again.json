But they are really well done, with beautiful artwork, the boxes are sturdy and look nice on the shelves. And they come with quality plastic card dividers with classy fantasy landscape artwork.\n\n \n\nTo very conveniently box up all my sleeved cards (thick FFG sleeves) it takes 5 of the M:tG Holiday Gift Boxes, and there is still room for more (to give you perspective, I have all up to Nin-in-Eilph, including PoDs, just without the two last GenCon quests). \n\n \n\nThere is one issue with the boxes. They come with four M:tG booster packs inside, so the price includes those boosters. Still, it is not that expensive when compared to what other storage solutions you can get. And I get a deal at my FLGS (which I am sure you can arrange for too at yours) that I get a huge discount but let them keep all the boosters. Or you could just sell the boosters, or share costs with someone who likes M:tG, and then net cost of the box would be very cheap.\n\n \n\nAs for sleeves, I put all my cards into FFG sleeves. \n\n \n\nhttp://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS05 [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS05]\n\n \n\nTheses sleeves have far lower wear & tear than anything else I tried. Plus they feel good in hand, shuffling is not a problem, and at the same time they are not too slippery."}]}
