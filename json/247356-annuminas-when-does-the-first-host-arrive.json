Thefore you would not see a Host til your second turn there.  I'm running an epic multiplayer game on Saturday, and I'm hoping to get some confirmation on how this works."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/247356-annuminas-when-does-the-first-host-arrive/?do=findComment&comment=2735320","commentId":2735320,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1492364004,"content":"If a card enters play as a consequence of some trigger, then the new card can't respond to that trigger.

We handled them with a nearly full geared Beregond (Gondorian Shield + Raven-winged Helm + Burning Brand + Armored Destrier). Only Captain of Gondor was missing because the encounter deck stole it from us before the Brand was equipped (**** you Sorcery of Carn Dum!). That's \"only\" 2 damage per round (taken care of by Warden of Headling) and the Host itself was put to the sword by some really angry Booming Ents. I definitely can recommend Ents in this scenario because you have some time to build up your board state in phase 1 and they are great at taking archery damage to there advantage!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/247356-annuminas-when-does-the-first-host-arrive/?do=findComment&comment=2753834","commentId":2753834,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1493204018,"content":"Nothing a Gimli(Le) - Dori - Combo can't serve :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
