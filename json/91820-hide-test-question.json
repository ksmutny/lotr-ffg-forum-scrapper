Perhaps they retain their \"committed to the quest status\" despite assisting in the test?\n\n \n\nA tangent on this idea would be a card such as Ranger Bow.  If a character was committed to the quest and then readied, could the character and ranger bow be exhausted to deal one damage prior to quest resolution?\n\n \n\nIs there a rules clarification that I missed somewhere that settles this issue?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91820-hide-test-question/?do=findComment&comment=885412","commentId":885412,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1381357921,"content":"You can quest any character, and after, if he is ready by card effect, etc., he can be exhausted to attack by hand upon the bow, or to do hide test, etc.\n\nI think there are no rules about it, because it is evident.

But in rulebooks (Core p. 30, Black rider p.7) is seems player cannot activate Action.\n\n \n\nWhat is the correct interpretation?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91820-hide-test-question/?do=findComment&comment=1606047","commentId":1606047,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1430792193,"content":"There is an action window between declaring which characters are committed to a quest and revealing the encounter cards.  You can use this window to ready a character.\n\n \n\nPerhaps what you are referring to is that fact that once you start revealing encounter cards during the quest phase there is no action window until after all cards are revealed.  "}]}
