Now, that card could certainly be worded differently to reflect a \"dead\" pile of just heroes, but why create several separate out-of-play piles when only one is necessary? \n\n\n\nI understand, but we know that it only targets heroes.  Fortune and Fate could easily be worded to reflect a dead hero and not a dead hero in the discard pile.  A hero card is a special and specific type of card. Putting them in a discard pile that is highly interacted with just can add confusion to new players.  There isn't a card(yet) that interacts with both Heroes and other cards in the discard pile where having a Hero dead pile separate from the discard pile can accomplish the same thing but with less confusion.  So far, Heroes are ignored completely in the discard pile except for with cards that resurrect them.\n\nI mean, the Hero dead pile wouldn't grow that much either.  So, with rare times you interact with them, why put them into a pile where they can easily be lost in a reshuffle, or are ignored when any card interacts with the discard pile?\n\nIt's like throwing a mechanic into a room full of surgeons where 98% of the time, someone will come in for surgery... but the other 2% of the time, somehow a lawnmower or car with engine problems gets thrown in the mix.  The solution would have been to just give the mechanic a garage where cars and such get worked on specifically.  No need for him to be in the OR with surgeons!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62644-hero-card-in-hand-now-what/?do=findComment&comment=613404","commentId":613404,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1333538574,"content":"Another thing they could have done is just use a different card back for hero cards.

Sounds really cool. Your hero is not dead, just lost. And what is more funny can be found in any moment or.....maybe not.....\n\nMaybe he will be lost for  whole session.  Card game text say : (every player shuffle a hero.....)

My instincts tell me that the resources would be lost and the attachments discarded, but that seems awfully harsh and really misses a key point on theme. If a hero wanders off, he would still carry all of his gear with him, and when he found the group again, he should still have his gear. If I were ruling it, I'd say that all attachments and resources remain on the table, but no cards can interact with those attachments or resource until the hero is discovered."}]}
