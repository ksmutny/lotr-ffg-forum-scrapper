If a card says to add a travel token to the active location, and there isn't any location that I had traveled before, what happens? This token goes to the quest instead? Is it lost?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49355-active-location-question/?do=findComment&comment=494064","commentId":494064,"userName":"Periculum","timestamp":1309532267,"content":"It works like this. If something would throw a token on the quest, it is blocked by any active location and it would be placed on the location instead.\n\nHowever, if something would place a progress token on a location and there is no location it does not go to the quest, it would just be lost."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49355-active-location-question/?do=findComment&comment=494153","commentId":494153,"userName":"Jimson","timestamp":1309551803,"content":" Well that stinks.  Looks like I was playing that wrong."}]}
