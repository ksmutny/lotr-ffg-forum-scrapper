I dont like the idea build up certain deck against certain quest( in my opinion in this case you always have advantage against encounter deck, sound like chaeting).\n\nBut after Rhosgobel is release was quite difficult for me build this kind of deck. So now my final version of all quest beat deck (exept Dol-Guldor).\n\nTotal Cards (50)\n\nHero (3)\nEleanor (Core) x1\nGlorfindel (Core) x1\nTheodred (Core) x1\n\nAlly (13)\n\nRadagast (AJTR) x1\nGandalf (Core) x3\nHaldir of Lorien (AJtR) x2\nHenamarth Riversong (Core) x2\nLongbeard Map-Maker (CatC) x2\nRivendell Minstrel (THFG) x1\nGleowine (Core) x2\n\nAttachment (25)\nA Burning Brand (CatC) x2\nAncient Mathom (AJtR) x3\nCelebrian's Stone (Core) x2\nDunedain Mark (THfG) x2\nDunedain Warning (CatC) x3\nForest Snare (Core) x3\nProtector of Lorien (Core) x2\nSong of Wisdom (CatC) x3\nSteward of Gondor (Core) x3\nUnexpected Courage (Core) x2\n\nEvent (12)\nA Test of Will (Core) x3\nLore of Imladris (Core) x3\nSneak Attack (Core) x3\nThe Galadhrim's Greeting (Core) x3\n\nThis deck work quite stable and have answer for almost situations of the game.Steward, B brand and Warning you  play on Eleanor and she suppose to have Song of Wisdom.She is mostly Defernder and Cancel When revealed effect.\n\nMarks and U courage to Glorifindel for Quest and Attack.\n\nStone to Theodred also mostly for quest and add resources to Glorifindel pool to heal or for map malker to quest like hell. Yes here is no Northern tracker but Map-Maker when you have enough resources give you opportunity quest quite effective.\n\nHaldir is amazing Ally. Sure you need Gildor as well but i still wait for my Emyn Muil.

You should consider using CDB for things like deck lists.\n\nwww.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/forum/19-lotr-lcg-decks/]\n\n \n\nAs for your deck.. I like it.. but I am not a fan of Glorfindel. Also Radagast seams a little off in this deck.. you only have a single copy so chances of pulling him are low, so you can not rely on him as engine in this deck, you just may not ever pull him at only 1 card. It is true that unlike a duel game you get a lot more time to pull as you can optionally choose to stall the game much easier than in a dueling game, but I still tend to side on the \"old school\" I guess opinion that engine cards need multiple copies to ensure a reliable draw.\n\nWhile this deck looks like it could be fun, I think at a glance that it is to dependent on a good draw. I think you may find that your win / loss ratio isn't that good, and after a while you may be able to tell if you are going to loose after only a few turns.\n\nAlso if you are planning to make a deck to run the entire course of the Shadows of Mirkwood campaign (what most deck builders are planning to do once the last 2 are released) You will most likely need some eagles / or ranged allies... or at least a way to extend your threat reduction abilities.\n\nStill not a bad start, just some play testing and refining here and there and this could easily end up doing what you want for this campaign set. I hope you keep at it, as yo are approaching this very different to me... as I said I have hardly touched Glorfindel.

I've played it about 10 times and haven't won yet, Heck I'm having trouble getting through stage 1B. I'm finding that once you get a Hunters from Mordor and a signs of Gollum card in play, it becomes very difficult to quest successfully due to the increased threat they pose and even if you do manage to quest successfully you have to draw 3 cards from the encounter deck add one to the staging are and discard the other two, so even if you choose the least nasty one it still increased the threat in the staging area. And Unless you have Unexpected courage on Glorfindel, you can't engage because there is no way of damaging them plus you risk losing a hero when defending. I have found that you can't leave an ally ready for defending because you need them to quest otherwise your threat goes up too quickly and then the hunters engage you.
