Most of the quests seem balanced around 1 or 2 players, with a smattering of 4 player quests thrown in there as well. Well for those of you lucky enough to have 2 whole friends who want to embark on an epic quest with you, here are a few suggestions.\n\nhttps://visionofthepalantir.com/2020/11/06/three-player-quests/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2020/11/06/three-player-quests/]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312381-vision-of-the-palantir-three-player-quests/?do=findComment&comment=4011436","commentId":4011436,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1604732535,"content":"Awesome and cool post idea!
