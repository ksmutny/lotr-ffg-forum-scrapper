I know many of you will disagree that this is not power creep, and that is fine, you may be right, but I am immediately struck by how good this one is!\n\nI think in balance, and in flavor of the book, that Bard's ability should read more like this: \"When making a ranged attack against an enemy with Hit Points 4 or greater, that enemy is -2 Defense. \n\nThis ability would play up Bard's moment in the book in which he takes down a \"large target\" and it would also make his \"niche\" so to speak, taking out those big guys. \n\nWhat do you guys think about Bard?\n\n-Joseph"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78000-i-call-power-creep-on-the-new-hero-bard/?do=findComment&comment=752141","commentId":752141,"userName":"Captain Poe","timestamp":1358938393,"content":"Both those cards exhaust Bard.

First I was indeed thinking of Bard, Legolas and Dunhere but Glorfindel is indeed the option there. You have Counsel to keep the threat low, Unseen Strike to boost against stronger enemies, you snipe those with low engagement cost with Hands.\n\nThe other deck can help a lot though. Have say Aragorn, Theorded and Frodo to manage the threat with Good Meal and Galadhrims and Wandering Earendil together with Aragorn's ability. Theodred will pay for the likes of Fresh Tracks, so that you have more options against the low engagement cost enemies. Plus, it is not a great deal when one or two slips and engages you. You try to have Frodo get the damage or just block it on that side, Feint will help from the other deck. Light in the Dark is a spare option against some enemies too.\n\nI actually think Numenor, especially Pelargir, is more than beatable like this. And I had tried a similar tactics. Guys like Theorded or Aragorn are actually much better for the battle quests, and by the final stage, you should have the broken Sword on Strider to quest heavily."}]}
