Even though the first card \"trashed\" wasn't, in fact, trashed, the game framework added it to the ledger for the purpose of \"first\" references anyway.\n\nIt was byzantine, and eventually one of the cards in the interaction was straight-up errata'ed to clarify the issue. Still, the point is that it's not always clear what \"first\" means in LCGs, which is kind of what Seastan is getting at."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263184-bolg-and-quick-ears/?do=findComment&comment=3079156","commentId":3079156,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1510676226,"content":"> 6 hours ago, monkeyrama said:\n> \n> I am sure that this will be answered better by others, but I was under the impression that the key word here is 'cancelled', which means that the card/effect technically didn't really happen.\n> \n> So, The Door is Closed! cancels the effects, and not the card, but Bolg adds surge to the card.

Shuffle that card back into the encounter deck and reveal another encounter card.\n\nAll the encounter cards that use the word 'additional' obviously don't cancel the previous card. Frankly, if I'm honest, I don't know what the game has to say about cards being cancelled. @GrandSpleen [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/177891-grandspleen/]'s point, if correct, would mean that this is a way to lessen Bolg's power, because the Surge would be cancelled on the card, but you'd still have revealed the card, so no other card gains Surge. I suppose it comes down to whether or not cancelling a card also cancels it's type(!) or just the effects...maybe ask the developers? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I'm inclined to think that 'additional' is just to specify with consistent language that you are revealing another card, since they seem to ditch the 'next card' text from Eleanor after the Core Set (it's used on Grima and the Lonely Mountain)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263184-bolg-and-quick-ears/?do=findComment&comment=3079323","commentId":3079323,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1510681098,"content":"I'm agree that Bolg add a text to the ennemy so if that enemy is canceled you also fully counter the Bolg effect, that mean that the next enemy would not have surge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263184-bolg-and-quick-ears/?do=findComment&comment=3080824","commentId":3080824,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1510761683,"content":"> 23 hours ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> I think that sounds reasonable.

The additional therefore is just to clarify that you have cancelled the encounter card revealed but still have to reveal one to replace it as a separate reveal.
