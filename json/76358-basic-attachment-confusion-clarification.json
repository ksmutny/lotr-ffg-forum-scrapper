I would assume yes, but i'm trying to clear it up between a friend and myself.\n\nThank you for the answers in advance, and I apologize if this was brought up before but I could not find it through the search."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76358-basic-attachment-confusion-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=740080","commentId":740080,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1356768407,"content":"Yeah, that's fine.  The attachment doesn't need to match the attached hero's sphere, unless otherwise stated on the card (as with A Burning Brand, for example).  \n\nAnd if the card DOES require a particular sphere, you can attach it to a hero who only has that sphere icon due to a song (again with Burning Brand, this means you could attach it to a leadership sphere Aragorn if he has a Song of Wisdom attached).  If that Song were to then be discarded by some game effect, the hero could continue to use the attachment -- the condition is only a play restriction, and not an ongoing requirement."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76358-basic-attachment-confusion-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=740123","commentId":740123,"userName":"PaintedHero","timestamp":1356774474,"content":"Thank you for clearing that up for me, that's exactly how I was thinking it would go I just wanted to make sure! sonreir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/sonreir.gif]"}]}
