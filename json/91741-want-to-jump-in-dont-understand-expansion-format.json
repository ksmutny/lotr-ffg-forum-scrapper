Like do I need to buy the small expansions or can I just buy the large ones? Also I read each individual pack includes a set quest, so does this mean I do not need all the cards in a set?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91741-want-to-jump-in-dont-understand-expansion-format/?do=findComment&comment=884415","commentId":884415,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1381253245,"content":"Welcome to the game! You need the Core set first. The Shadows of Mirkwood cycle (6 small Adventure Packs) doesn't need an expansion, but the Dwarrowdelf cycle (another 6 packs) needs the Khazad-Dûm expansion. The Against The Shadow cycle needs the Heirs of Númenor expansion. The two Hobbit expansions and The Black Riders are Saga expansions, and you only need the core set to play them.\n\n \n\nSo:\n\n \n\n-Core set\n\n-Shadows of Mirkwood:\n\nThe Hunt for Gollum\n\nConflict at the Carrock\n\nA Journey to Rhosgobel\n\nThe Hills of Emyn Muil\n\nThe Dead Marshes\n\nReturn to Mirkwood\n\n \n\n-Khazad-Dûm Expansion\n\n-The Dwarrowdelf:\n\nThe Redhorn Gate\n\nThe Road to Rivendell\n\nThe Watcher in the Water\n\nThe Long Dark\n\nFoundations of Stone\n\nShadow and Flame\n\n \n\n-The Heirs of Númenor Expansion\n\n-Against the Shadow:\n\nThe Steward's Fear\n\nThe Drúadan Forest\n\nEncounter at Amon Dín\n\nAssault on Osgiliath\n\nThe Blood of Gondor\n\nThe Morgul Vale\n\n \n\n... and then the independent expansions:\n\n \n\n-The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill\n\n-The Hobbit: On the Doorstep\n\n \n\n-The Black Riders\n\n \n\nThe expansions contain the encounter (enemy, location etc) cards used in the following cycles. So, for instance, to play The Steward's Fear you need cards from Heirs of Númenor. You are of course free to buy the expansions in any order you like. You don't need to play Khazad-Dûm in order to appreciate Heirs of Númenor - though Khazad-Dûm and Dwarrowdelf contain some great cards that make Númenor scenarios a lot easier. Hope this helps, and don't hesitate to keep asking!\n\nEdited October 8, 2013 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91741-want-to-jump-in-dont-understand-expansion-format/?do=findComment&comment=884529","commentId":884529,"userName":"genuwine21","timestamp":1381261222,"content":"Interesting, so does each pack make a complete encounter (if I have the matching large expansion/core set) or would I need the entire set of 6 to have a complete encounter?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91741-want-to-jump-in-dont-understand-expansion-format/?do=findComment&comment=884549","commentId":884549,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1381262694,"content":"You need, say, Khazad-Dûm to play any of the 6 following adventure packs, but the small packs are complete scenarios and independent of each other.

You will probably also need more resource, progress and damage tokens than those included in a single core set. Also, you may find it tricky to get along and distribute powerful cards evenly with such a limited card pool - but expansions should quickly fix that. So yes, it's possible - but the experience for a 3-4-player game is better with 2 core sets."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91741-want-to-jump-in-dont-understand-expansion-format/?do=findComment&comment=885594","commentId":885594,"userName":"genuwine21","timestamp":1381394107,"content":"Awesome, just got my set yesterday, need to still read the rules but otherwise all set to play."}]}
