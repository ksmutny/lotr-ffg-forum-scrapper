I first tried The Uruk Hai with an Elladan and Elrohir deck and lost pretty quickly since I couldn't get the attachments. But then I built a Gandalf Elrond Glorfindel deck with lots of unique allies and beat it the first time, and then Helm's Deep and The Road to Isengard and won as well, recruiting 3 ents. Since then I've played with a variety of decks, all very powerful granted (Rohan, Elladan and Elrohir in Campaign mode), but I'm sure my win rate is higher that my losses. Maybe I've been lucky, but I haven't found the quests that hard, and I am rather shocked to be honest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187527-the-treason-of-saruman-not-that-hard/?do=findComment&comment=1778952","commentId":1778952,"userName":"soullos","timestamp":1441595361,"content":"I haven't tried the quests just yet (still going through Campaign mode, currently at Fog of the Barrow Downs).

As an easy mode player, that gives me hope. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\nDid you play one-handed solo?

I was also very scared of these quests, but some of my fears were unfounded. For example, I didn't know that you don't raise your threat from questing unsuccessfully during a Defense quest, so threat levels like 5 and effects like Deeping Wall make more sense, an are way tamer due to the fact that you don't raise your threat.They're still very complex quests and there are lots of things to keep track of, but I played carefully and they weren't really hard. i also played thematic mode with a Theoden, Eowyn and Eomer deck with 3 proxies of Gamling and Snowmane and just your standard Rohan alies that discard themselves, some events, Theoden's and Eomer's stuf, etc. and won the first 2 quests in the first try. Also, Eowyn's just great at convincing the ents. So as I said I'm kinda shocked but I also appreciate that they didn't make these quests frustratingly hard."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187527-the-treason-of-saruman-not-that-hard/?do=findComment&comment=1779053","commentId":1779053,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1441601449,"content":"I do not find them that hard also, but certainly not easy if you play thematic decks. Never tried any of my super decks. Either tried with thematic to have a play and offcource on my campaign were again I use thematic decks. They are a puzzle and especially Helms deep is unique and you have to think different in order to win it with the defence thing. In all of them the problem is threat raiging IMO, if you can manage that then they can be won\n\n \n\nWhen I first tried Uruk Hai I had not read encounter or quest cards, had a treesphaire deck and with a hero captued failed misserably. The I tried a two sphaire and won on second attempt. \n\nHelms Deep lost the first out of a bad shadow card, if not I would have won it on my attacking phase. Won next attempt. \n\nOn Road to Isengard I never managed to have more than on Ent of Fangorn with me and usually takes two or three turns (have 2 or 3 quest power heroes), thus I start with at least two encounter card for only one ent. Maybe I am unlucky I do not know.

The encounter deck simply has very little chance of manifesting much synergy on its \"turn\". If you want to see how difficult a scenario like Helm's Deep can be, try playing it with four players where the decks were not tailored ahead of time. Scenarios like Weather Hills - where the encounter deck is designed to combo certain treacheries with other effects, are a particularly striking example of this. That scenario can feel trivially easy solo,  but watching two teams play it - on easy mode no less - at Gen Con was a stark reminder of how much more effective the encounter deck is when you are revealing 4-7 cards per round instead of 1-2 (or very rarely 3) cards per round. I know that many players play exclusively solo, but I feel very strongly that the best way to have the complete experience of this game is with 2 players. If you want true difficulty, play 4 players. There are of course exceptions to this, but in playing the game hundreds of times over the last 3 years I have found this to be generally the case."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187527-the-treason-of-saruman-not-that-hard/?do=findComment&comment=1779113","commentId":1779113,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1441606247,"content":"But multiplayer is meant to be played with decks built ahead of time...
