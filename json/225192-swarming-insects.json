Does this mean more damage than the number of other characters in play? Or more damage than the collected damage of other characters? Thanks, Dave."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225192-swarming-insects/?do=findComment&comment=2314125","commentId":2314125,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1468784572,"content":"Look at all your characters: does one of them have more damage than any other?  If so that character gets three additional damage. It doesn't matter how many characters in play or the collected damage.\n\n \n\nExample: There are five characters in play.
