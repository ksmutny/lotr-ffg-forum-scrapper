While there is an active location, progress tokens from questing MUST be placed on that location until it is explored (i.e., they CAN'T be placed on the quest card until the active location is explored, barring effects that specifically bypass the active location). If Twisting Passage is active and the locate test is failed, there is no place for the progress tokens to go. \n\nI usually just leave it in the staging area and use cards like Bombur to negate its threat. Making it active can really put you in a bind."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69282-twisting-passage-tld-92/?do=findComment&comment=675568","commentId":675568,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1345215558,"content":"ive never failed a locate test yet- theyre a bit too easy in my opinion"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69282-twisting-passage-tld-92/?do=findComment&comment=675827","commentId":675827,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1345243713,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nive never failed a locate test yet- theyre a bit too easy in my opinion\n\n\n\nLong dark is quite easy with 1 or 2 players is true. But try it 3 or 4 players. You will see is one of the most difficult quest and also very interesting and cool with 3 or more players. Encounter deck start to play some really interesting combo and since you have many cards with lost effect in the game everything is going to be much more dangerous. This like completely other game. One of the best quest for coop 3 up players."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69282-twisting-passage-tld-92/?do=findComment&comment=675901","commentId":675901,"userName":"Legolas of Darkwood","timestamp":1345262784,"content":" Thank you for your answers.

If you don't have any scouting, pucker up, bend over, kiss your ass and hope for the best.
