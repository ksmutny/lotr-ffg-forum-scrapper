However, in looking again at the card above, it seems like a kind of \"passive game state\" I'm to always check, where as soon as it's true (meaning I need to destroy 1 Lieutenant, and that's only possible when the city strength is 0) then at the end of that round -- before I'd do any Forced effects -- I instantly win.\n\nIs that right? Or am I missing something where the Forced effects are to first take place and rotate in another Lieutenant after I've destroyed my first one?\n\nEdited July 11, 2018 by JYoder"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279060-attack-on-dol-guldur-confused-on-win-condition/?do=findComment&comment=3401232","commentId":3401232,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1531302069,"content":"You can't destroy any lieutenant until Dol Guldur is at 0 strenght: all lieutenant are indestructible.\n\nSo, no matter how many players there is you have to, on the end of the turn have on the same time all lieutenant in play with as many damage as life point and Dol Guldur at 0 strenght.\n\nI hope it is clear enough :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279060-attack-on-dol-guldur-confused-on-win-condition/?do=findComment&comment=3401331","commentId":3401331,"userName":"JYoder","timestamp":1531314500,"content":"Yes, as I said, when the city strength is 0, I can destroy the 1 Lieutenant in play.\n\nBut in stand game mode, there can only be 1 Lieutenant in play at a time -- the other 3 are all \"out of play\".\n\nTherefore, at the end of the round, it appears I have met the win condition, because there are now no Lieutenants in play.\n\nSo in standard game mode, all you need to do is destroy 1 Lieutenant and you win?\n\nEdited July 11, 2018 by JYoder"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279060-attack-on-dol-guldur-confused-on-win-condition/?do=findComment&comment=3401376","commentId":3401376,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1531317594,"content":"Yes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279060-attack-on-dol-guldur-confused-on-win-condition/?do=findComment&comment=3401793","commentId":3401793,"userName":"JYoder","timestamp":1531333152,"content":"Sounds good.

I see how a  lieutenant﻿ ends up in the vd (city strength 0 and I destroyed him).
