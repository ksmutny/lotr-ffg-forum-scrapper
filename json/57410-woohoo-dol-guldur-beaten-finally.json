We used decks that I constructed specifically for the quest, with a lower than normal number of allies and more events/attachments (since you can not play more than one ally/round). The deck I played was a mono sphere Tactics deck with Eagle theme (Legolas, Gimli and Bard) and she played a dual sphere Spirit/Leadership deck with Rohan theme (Eowyn, Dunhere, Aragorn). Worked very well and although it was challenging we felt we had control most of the time.\n\nWe have 2 core sets and one of every chapter pack in the first cycle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57410-woohoo-dol-guldur-beaten-finally/?do=findComment&comment=566452","commentId":566452,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1323623347,"content":" Cool gartock!  Two core sets probably helps.  We just have one and the aps only through emyn muil.  We just won for the first time today as a trio against emyn muil.  I had won solo, and we had won in pairs, but never as a trio."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57410-woohoo-dol-guldur-beaten-finally/?do=findComment&comment=566486","commentId":566486,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1323631365,"content":"Hi Zjb12 and company... with all the Dol Guldur love flying around on this thread, I wanted to stop by personally and invite you to enter my first 2 Player Tournament, featuring EfDG with some particular deck building parameters.
