How does this play out? \n\nScenario 1: Frodo blocks the 6str attack but uses his ability. All Troll dmg is cancelled so Troll's ability does not apply. However, how much dmg is actually canceled? All 6 of the Trolls STR? The trolls STR minus Frodo's defense (4)? Only the dmg that Frodo can sustain (2)?\n\n \n\nScenario 2: Same questions as above, but for an undefended attack where the damage is given to Frodo then canceled.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60899-interaction-between-frodo-and-hill-troll/?do=findComment&comment=597917","commentId":597917,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1330000987,"content":"If he blocks you subtract his defense. So he would get 4 damage. You can cancel all 4 damage and turn it into 4 threat.\n\nIf the attack is undefended, you will raise your threat by 6."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60899-interaction-between-frodo-and-hill-troll/?do=findComment&comment=959077","commentId":959077,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1390200476,"content":"Has this been confirmed? Since Frodo can only receive 2 damage, do you ever need to raise your threat by more than 2?\n\nI guess if someone attacks him for 6, then if you only cancel 2 damage, you'd still die. I guess it makes sense either way."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60899-interaction-between-frodo-and-hill-troll/?do=findComment&comment=959615","commentId":959615,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1390248754,"content":"Muemakan is correct. (The amount of damage that can be cancelled is not limited by Frodo's hit points)\n\nEdited January 20, 2014 by chuckles"}]}
