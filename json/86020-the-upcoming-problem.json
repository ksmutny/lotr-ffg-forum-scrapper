well.  And I think that's why Angmar and Forochel jumped to mind... try and make up for that rushed job (even though I love that game as well).\n\nI'm not sure how deeply FFG would want to get into \"the far East\" concept (whether we wish them to or not).  With so little being actually written/published about those wizards and where they went, I would have my doubts that 1) the Tolkien estate would license them the go-ahead to speculate heavily on that region, and 2) FFG would even want to broach a subject that a) would require creating more material (rather than relying on know/written material) and b) would inevitably invite criticism from hard-core Tolkien \"scholars\"...\n\nEdited July 10, 2013 by

pack.\n\nnot that im a snob (yes you are richard....) but as i said earlier in this thread, so many have got it wrong, and ffg are up there with some of the best designers of middle earth. i wouldnt want them to ruin it.\n\n \n\nthat being said, perhaps the fact they have done such a great job means that they could handle such a vague element of middle earth. it would certainly be interesting to see the outcome...and on a more serious note, i could actually forgive mistakes after keeping so well to the lore...but not too many that it ruined the feel of the game. every game has hit and misses right?\n\n \n\nand on an even more serious and 'deep' thought, such a vagueness surely allows for one's own perception....everyone probaby has their own ideas of the unkowns of middle earth and it would be hard to please everyone\n\n \n\ni think the outcome of great or awful would not be so much on the created content, but on how 'natural' it felt in place in middle earth....certainly a tough thing to do with such dedicated fans\n\n \n\nlastly, i think another difficulty is the fact there would be essentially no areas that give that lovely 'nostalgia' i (and others) get when they visit much loved areas. i think it would be near impossible to give it that tolkien feel.\n\n \n\nso yes, despite many wanting to see harad and rhun and others, it is not certain will shall see them which leaves even more debate for where we go next\n\n \n\ni think more success would be had from the ruins of the north kingdom as there is far more to base things on, but thats just my opinion.\n\nrich\n\nEdited July 10, 2013 by

example again (not that ffg should be taking tips from them of course) they had sort of barrow down inspired spirits as a main enemy, evil men i think, wargs (though i think they were barghast), and then mainly orcs of different sorts.\n\n \n\ni guess the base enemy would be orcs....you cant really go wrong there as they were pretty much the standard enemy in middle earth. the designers would have to be careful not to imply they roamed too far south down the greenway, otherwise the breelanders would soon discover how rubbish the rangers were at protecting them :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nthe witch king was supposed to send the spirits to the barrow downs, so i suppose its not too far a stretch to take inspiration for that and have the ruins of carn dum inhabited with evil spirits..perhaps even some roaming trolls, though i dont think it should be rebuilt as in lotro as we dont hear of any battles there during the war of the ring, which would surely have played a part if it was.\n\n \n\nevil men or bandits would surely roam the greenway, though what for i cannot guess as no one used it. perhaps a few of them went so far as bree for supplies, so after a shire/breeland cycle we could make our way north up the greenway after hearing of strange tales in the prancing pony inn from butterbur.\n\n \n\nafter that we could visit each of the main places. i dont think we could visit it per kingdom, as in the civil war, as arnor covered most of eriador, so we would end up revisiting the shire again...but i think we could go to fornost, annuminas, the far north to angmar\n\n \n\nsounds quite promising to me!\n\nEdited July 11, 2013 by richsabre"}]}
