Yes. It cannot attack the same enemy, but it can attack multiple enemy's if you are able to ready him.\n\n \n\n2.  The FAQ (page 5) says:\n\n\"(1.29) Victory Display\nThe victory display is a game area where victory points are tracked. Cards in the victory display are considered to be out of play, but are not considered to be a part of the encounter discard pile. Cards in the victory display are not considered “removed from game,” and some card effects may still interact with them.\"\n\n \n\nSo the answer is they are still in game…\n\n \n\n3 - Don't know exactly…. With the proper deck, i believe each quest is doable in solo, as it is with the proper deck combination in multi-player.\n\nYou have the example of Massing at Osgiliath: it is a lot easy with less players. It is almost impossible in 4-player. (In my play goup, we only beat it twice and played it a lot - see my results posted at the living tornament)\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73644-multilpe-ranged-attacks-cards-with-victory-points/?do=findComment&comment=718859","commentId":718859,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1352044888,"content":" The ranged question comes up from time to time.  The simple answer is that any character can attack any enemy any number of times (i.e., there is no limit) as long as the attack can be legally declared and the character is not otherwise prevented from attacking (e.g., is already exhausted, or has some Condition attachment that prevents the attack).  The limit is this: A player can declare 1 and only 1 attack against each enemy with which they are engaged.  If the character is ranged, you can also declare is at an attacker against enemies engaged with other players (or participate in attacks declared by another player).\n\nSo, yes, a ranged character can attack the same enemy multiple times in a single round.  Limitations apply to declaring attacks, not to participating in attacks.  (Example: on my turn I declare an attack against Dol Guldur Beastmaster and exhaust Haldir to attack.  I then use Ever Vigilant to ready him.  Then it's my partner's turn.  She has Brand on her side.  She can declare an attack against Dol Guldur Beastmaster, and Haldir is eligible to participate).\n\nFrom the FAQ:\n\n(1.11) Limitations on Attacks\nWhen a player is the active attacker during the combat phase, the game rules grant him the option to declare 1 attack against each enemy with which he is engaged. If, through card effects such as ranged, a player is able to declare attacks against enemies with which he is not engaged, he is still only permitted a single attack against each of these enemies.\nCharacters are not limited as to how many times they can participate in attacks against the same enemy, provided each attack can be legally declared, and the character is ready and eligible to be declared as an attacker. (my emphasis)  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "}]}
