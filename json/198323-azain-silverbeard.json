Sorry hehe. Anyway, I really like the card. Giving new options to Tactics Dwarves with sucha good ally. Works excellently against bosses like the Trolls (Carrock or Hobbit) and those quests where you can get swamed by Nazgul or Barrow wights. Dealing 2 damage to such enemies is very welcome, with Dwarves or not. Also, that other Last Stand event, by the slightly visible curve in the cost, I'll hazard will cost 0, and the effect will be like \"After a (Rohan) character is destroyed while defending that attack, deal damage to the enemy equal to the characters\" hit points? attack? defense? Anyway, it depicts Hama as the flavor text suggests, and it's looking awesome. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/198323-azain-silverbeard/?do=findComment&comment=1980033","commentId":1980033,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1452323027,"content":"Just chopping an orc in half."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/198323-azain-silverbeard/?do=findComment&comment=1980061","commentId":1980061,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1452325960,"content":"It's silly, but my first thought was to attach Sword-thain to him so that I can add a copy of Mighty Prowess.

This guy could be killer in the KD/DD quests. But for the later quests, or the AtS scenarios with a wider range of enemy traits, not so much. This is what makes this a Living card game. The power curve of the player cards and encounter cards grow together.

It is not so critical in a cooperative game where the community and the players self-regulate themselves, but still it would be a nice touch."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/198323-azain-silverbeard/?do=findComment&comment=1985660","commentId":1985660,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1452618665,"content":"I believe the Tactics event deals damage equal to the defeated allies cost, actually.
