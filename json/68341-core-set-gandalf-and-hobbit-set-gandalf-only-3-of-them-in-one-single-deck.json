Since both Gandalf cards have the same title you cannot include more than a total of 3 in your deck. However, you can mix-and-match if you want to play with 1 \"old\" and 2 \"new\" or vice versa.Â \n> \n> Hope you enjoy The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill when it comes out!\n> \n> Thanks for playing,\n> \n> Caleb.\n\nI expected this, but a little part of me still wanted to believe it could have been possible to play more than 3 Gandalfs ^^"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68341-core-set-gandalf-and-hobbit-set-gandalf-only-3-of-them-in-one-single-deck/?do=findComment&comment=666490","commentId":666490,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1343734466,"content":"yes myself and a friend were discussion this today- combining them shall make for some interesting strategies though"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68341-core-set-gandalf-and-hobbit-set-gandalf-only-3-of-them-in-one-single-deck/?do=findComment&comment=667047","commentId":667047,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1343817884,"content":"Yes you can play new Gandalf and keep him for couple of rounds. Then you play old one and reduce the threat which was added by new one (Discard him or add 2 threat in the end of the round)."}]}
