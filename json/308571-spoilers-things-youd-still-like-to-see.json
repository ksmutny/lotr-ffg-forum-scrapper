Crown of the Windlord Attachment that lets you exhaust it to return a Eagle ally from the discard pile to your hand. \n\n2. Fembrithel an Ent-Wife! (Or just another Lore or Tactics Ent hero like Leaflock or Skinbark preferably the former as its ally isn't great and maybe an ability like deal it a damage to increase its defense by 3)\n\n \n\n3. A Stone Giant (Gandalf did say there were good Giants, imagine one who starts with Toughness 1)\n\n \n\n4. Lore Legolas (he just seems like he should have one, maybe with the ability to discard a card to ready after declaring an attack or after he participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, ready Legolas. To show his battling hordes of enemies)\n\n \n\n5. Some Corsair support, literally anything, a mercenary/pirate for hire similar to the Dwarf but for tactics reassures. Or maybe a Cutless weapon (after declaring character as a defense, exhaust to ready character) and/or her throwing knives (exhaust to attach to an enemy, deal that enemy 2 damage, at the end of each round deal it an additional 2 damage, after enemy is defeated exhaust a character to attach throwing knives onto that character instead of discarding it)\n\n \n\n6.  Huorn - expensive ally that you place into the staging area and you can exhaust to deal 1 damage to an enemy that is placed in the staging area to replicate their part in The Battle of Helm's Deep, a forest that destroys enemies that enter them. Could also have a similar effect with when an enemy engages you exhaust to deal 1 damage but I like the idea of a staging area Ally.\n\n \n\n7. Anduril, guarded weapon that gives Aragorn a boost for having all four different resource icons.\n\n \n\n8. Spirit Aragorn ally, it's about time we got an Aragorn ally that could help out in fellowship decks. He could be Spirit or Leadership and grant +1 Willpower to heroes or unique characters. \n\n \n\n9. Trebuchet or Ballista Ally that can attack into the staging area.\n\n \n\n10.  Contract for all trait theme boosting, something like you can only include allies and heroes with the same trait from the following list: (Rohan, Gondor, Noldor, Silvan, Dale, Eagles, Ents, Woodman, Dunedain, Dwarf, Beorning, Hobbit, Outlands, Harad)\n\nExhaust this card to choose 2 of the following: reduce the cost of the next ally you play this phase by 2, return an ally from your discard pile to your hand, or draw a card.\n\n11. Alliance Contract - All heroes and allies in your deck can only contain two traits from the following list: Rohan, Gondor, Noldor, Silvan, Dale, Woodman, Dunedain, Dwarf, Hobbit, Harad.\n\nFor the remainder of the quest, all heroes and allies in play are treated as having both of the chosen traits. (This one would require some playtesting!)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308571-spoilers-things-youd-still-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=3943099","commentId":3943099,"userName":"EBerling","timestamp":1590159677,"content":"> 8 hours ago, General_Grievous said:\n> \n> It’s all about money, so if we keep asking for things and buying existing things there is a chance we could get some more. \n\n\nI know there's a ton of uncertainty (heck, with Asmodee's recent restructures at FFG and the Covid-tanking economy, who even knows if GamesWorkshop will exist in 5 years).  But I actually think LotR's chances of coming back in some form are better now than they were four months ago... maybe still low odds, but better?  Card games are much easier to produce, package, and ship than board/miniature games.  Given the turmoil in the global production chains, that alone may give them an edge over other products (also look at how many news articles on FFG's page recently have been about a Couple that with the huge influx of new customers/attention in the LotR LCG given the pandemic and staying-at-home (e.g. see the subreddit's data report) alongside the decline in interest in competitive games that require opponents, and LotR LCG probably looks more appealing to produce now than it did at the end of 2019."}]}
