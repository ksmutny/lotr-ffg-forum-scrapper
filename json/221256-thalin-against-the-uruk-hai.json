Since Thalin kills the Eastern Crows before they reach the \"when revealed\" part of their staging, the Surge keyword doesn't actually do anything. The card never reaches the point when Surge would do anything. It's not explicitly stated when Toughness comes into effect, but we may assume it is in effect as soon as the card is \"in play\". The encounter card presumably must be \"in play\" when Thalin deals a damage to it, otherwise it wouldn't be physically possible to deal a damage to it. Hence, it's a reasonable guess that Toughness is in effect as the card is being revealed.\n\n \n\nI don't think it's ever been explicitly answered, but I think our best guess should be that Toughness stops Thalin."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221256-thalin-against-the-uruk-hai/?do=findComment&comment=2242044","commentId":2242044,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1464665389,"content":"Toughness \"reduces any amount of damage dealt\" to the enemy.
