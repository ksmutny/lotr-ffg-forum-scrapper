I was very surprised and impressed and decided it was high time I finally slayed Smaug. \n\n \n\nI did not take on the proper challenge and instead took on the easier challenge of simply beating Lake-Town.\n\nI examined the quest deck and thought about how to go about beating it best. \n\nI conceded one game as after a mulligan I still did not receive the defensive cards I needed at the start. \n\nSecond game I got Arwen and Cloak of Lorien in the starting hand of the lore/spirit deck and Gondorian Shield (but not Steward) in the starting hand of the tactics/leadership deck as well as Gather Information. \n\nI slapped them all down on Elrohir and fetched Steward within a couple of turns as well (thanks to Gather Info) boosting his defense up to 7. I then got a Warden of Healing out and was pretty much set for the rest of the game. Asfaloth about halfway massively helped clear locations and I managed to draw two test of wills and two hasty strokes (all four of which were used) which were also integral. Skinbark, the old thrush (or whatever the objective card is called) and Legolas ally were all integral in killing Smaug towards the end and I had two rounds on stage 2 where I removed 9 and then 15 burn damage from Lake Town instead of placing progress. There were two cards that would smash me but I managed to cancel/avoid them both almost all game (Close to the Flame and Reckless in his Rage) except for one copy of Reckless in his Rage that almost resulted in a hero death (and 2 less damage to Smaug so he would have survived that round!) on the very final turn and one copy of Close to the Flame triggering right near the end as well killing the healers and a few naith guides but leaving everyone else intact (just a bit burnt!!).\n\n \n\nOne thing I noticed about this scenario is that the majority of the shadow effects are actually pretty **** tame or manageable. 1 damage to laketown, resolve all burn in play, if this attack destroys a character etc are all nothingness and if you are using a strong dedicated defender and not chump blocking many whiff. I never copped a shadow effect that raises attack strength (quite luckily) and was able to cancel two Close to the Flame shadow effects. The strongest version of Smaug had 8 attack and the MOST he could attack for was 10 (12 i guess if reckless appears during staging and then he gets one of the RARE shadow cards that give +2 attack but this did not happen) so at most I was taking 3 damage on Elrohir and he would survive, get fully healed by two Wardens and be ready for the next round. Often I was facing Smaug with 5 or 7 attack and he was not doing a single point of damage for the vast majority of the game. Towards the end there was a few rounds that were a little scary/touch and go but overall I have to say it was not anywhere near as hard as I thought it would be. If I'm being honest I have to say I think that certain nightmare quests such as Nightmare Shadow and Flame are probably far harder (if you aren't using Galadriel to just stay at 1 threat all game that is....) than Lake-Town now and it is definitely not the beast of a quest that I remember it being. You just REALLY have to get an uber defender set up quick fast, stay below 30/35 threat to avoid smaug attacking the first couple of turns and you are kind of set for the rest of the game....

Thanks so much for running this challenge as I really don't think I would have tried at all if it wasn't for you posting this challenge and me seeing so many people beat it with decks that are not really top tier and only built from heroes with less than 8 starting threat. \n> \n>  \n> \n> one last thing, there are many cards in both my decks that are completely useless for this quest, I actually did not remove a single one and just left them in there to see if my decks without any changes could win. I found that with the deck that ended up with the old thrush all these cards were PERFECT to discard to get more damage on Smaug and it didn't really matter that much with the other deck as I did not draw feint or other cards that would be useless and the only \"dead\" cards I drew from that deck was all 3 copies of Rivendell Blade which would do nothing to Smaug.  \n\nToo much text O_o"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186193-challenge-3/?do=findComment&comment=1767472","commentId":1767472,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1441121826,"content":"But for the challenge i haven't even got to stage 2 so i think i will skip this one  :mellow: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_mellow.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186193-challenge-3/?do=findComment&comment=1767804","commentId":1767804,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1441131045,"content":"Psycho, who were your heroes?  Sounds like you were running 4 spheres."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186193-challenge-3/?do=findComment&comment=1767854","commentId":1767854,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1441132351,"content":"4 spheres?

I spent a lot of time mucking about with a  Frodo-Sam-Pippin(L) deck that couldn't quite do it.

Eventually, I get Steward of Gondor and Gondorian Fire on Merry, and he one-shots Smaug at the end of the quest.\n \nMy first playthrough was the most epic--a treachery ended up discarding something like 25 cards from my deck so I couldn't get Denethor any higher than 6 defense. My healers were dead, my deck had run out, and I was facing the 8 attack Smaug. Denethor defended and died, and as I counted up the resource tokens on Merry he had exactly enough to kill Smaug in one hit. Had I been forced to go another turn I think I would have threated out due to failing the quest due to holding back chump blockers.\n \nFun challenge! Took me a lot of tries to find something that hadn't already been done. For the next one,  maybe something that will let me use my higher threat heroes? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186193-challenge-3/?do=findComment&comment=1797951","commentId":1797951,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1442369925,"content":"Thanks guys for the reports!
