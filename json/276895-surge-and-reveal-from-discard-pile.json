Response from Caleb:\n\n \n\nHi Javier,\nThe entry in the FAQ was originally meant to address the question of whether or not players should resolve those keywords if the card they appear on was revealed during Setup. The language “from the encounter deck” is extraneous and should not be viewed as a limitation to the keywords. You should resolve encounter keywords any time they appear on a card that is revealed, regardless of where it was revealed from.\nCheers,\nCaleb\n\n> On May 30, 2018, at 10:14 AM, no-reply@fantasyflightgames.com [no-reply@fantasyflightgames.com] wrote:\n> \n> Message from:\n> Javier Duran\n> \n> \n> E-mail:\n> dietervanhertz@gmail.com [dietervanhertz@gmail.com]\n> \n> \n> Rules Question:\n> Hi, I am recently having some doubts about the Surge keyword and cards which ask you to find a card in the deck, or discard pile, and reveal it.
