But I know that Predatory Wolves is going to be an issue for me when I do. So just to make it clear, can I or can I not choose to discard an ally when I don't have any allies?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183052-predatory-wolves/?do=findComment&comment=1700854","commentId":1700854,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1437597748,"content":"Either... Or structured instructions mean that you have to resolve one of the options completely. If that happens to say \"all allies\" or something, that could miss, because 0 still counts as all. Predatory wolves however targets one specific ally, so unless you can discard one, you have to search for a warg."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183052-predatory-wolves/?do=findComment&comment=1701095","commentId":1701095,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1437611899,"content":"You have to have allies to be able to sacrifice them... Also in the case of multiple allies tied for highest cost you can choose which one you discard. I found this insanely useful if you have multiple copies of a unique ally in your hand. Discard Arwen and just play her again next her. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183052-predatory-wolves/?do=findComment&comment=1701230","commentId":1701230,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1437625071,"content":"RIP Beorn :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183052-predatory-wolves/?do=findComment&comment=1701704","commentId":1701704,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1437665552,"content":"Okay, thanks.  There's been confusion in the past for me on cards like this, so thanks for clarifying."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183052-predatory-wolves/?do=findComment&comment=1702510","commentId":1702510,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1437721407,"content":"haha yeah beorn ally gets decimated by this card. Pretty lolz too cause its a bear being taken down by wolves and not just a normal bear but a huge shapeshifting bear. Must be some pretty badass wolves to take him down."}]}
