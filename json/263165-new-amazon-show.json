I'm glad that our devs fix that, even if it is only a little bit.\n\nThe Mouth of Sauron was described as a Black Numenorean -- the Black referring not to skin color, but allegience to Sauron.  There's no reason from the text to think his skin color was necessarily black, nor is he depicted as dark-skinned in Jackson's extended cut.  If there's something controversial about Jackson's portrayal, it's having Aragorn chop his head off, contrary to the text.\n\n\"White people\" is a bit of a nebulous concept, even apart from the fact that no one but albinos are truly white, and the exact threshold of melanin required to cross the threshold into \"non-white\" is not well-defined.  With that said, there's no hint in the text of racial diversity, in the modern sense, among the free humans we meet in the text -- nor any reason we should expect it among an ancient and homogenous society.  However, the appendixes make clear that Ecthelion, father of Denethor, welcomed talented outsiders to his service from any background (such as Thoringil/Aragorn), so that certainly presents the possibility of \"non-white\" humans laboring against Sauron -- however, that's a previous generation and only the long-lived Thorongil makes a contribution in our time frame.\n\nWith the violence Jackson performed to the text during his movies, I can see that expecting him to take further liberties in the service of providing a diversity of skin not suggested by the text isn't inherently unreasonable -- but I can't just find it offensive when a filmmaker *fails* to take liberties with the text.  The diversity in the Free Peoples of the text is between *actually different* races, not just marginally different shades of humans.  Making the movies make a point of the latter would come at the expense of the former."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3197556","commentId":3197556,"userName":"JJ48","timestamp":1517616360,"content":"> 2 hours ago, Rouxxor said:\n> \n> There could be people who come to fight Sauron (people like the ones we help in cycle 7),\n\nYes, we have good Haradrim in the LCG, but that's because our heroes are actually in Harad at the time.  Why should they travel to Gondor or Rohan to fight Sauron when they're already busy fighting Sauron in their own lands?  (Not to mention, past grievances between the Haradrim and Gondor could lead to more than a little mistrust on both sides).\n\nThere's nothing wrong with diversity, but I personally think that trying to force diversity when it wouldn't make sense isn't necessarily a great solution.  I mean, suppose we were making a movie about the Mongols invading China.  Would you insist that we absolutely had to cast people of European or African descent just so the movie would be more diverse?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3197702","commentId":3197702,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1517630132,"content":"The topic of race in The Lord of the Rings is a really deep one--one of these days I should do an essay or two on it for my blog.\n\nBut for the time being, I wanted to point out that when topics like this come up there are usually two different contexts that people use to analyze it:\n\n 1.

I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.  I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.  I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.\"\n\nIt is certainly true that a work of fiction need not be an allegory to have a 'message' -- it is equally true that for any moral message you could name, there are more works written to promote it than I could possibly read in my remaining lifetime.  LOTR is by design not meant to convey any particular message, and though it does move me and I find much 'applicability' within its pages, I do not think that is or should be a reasonable expectation for great works of fiction.  Dumas' The Three Musketeers is certainly a feigned history, but I've been unable to detect any moral message in it that I approve -- but it's a thumping good read all the same, and that by itself is enough to justify its existence, IMO.  I don't share Tolkien's disdain for allegories, but I certainly find that writing, like games, frequently suffers when the message is more important to the creator than the story."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3199257","commentId":3199257,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1517780030,"content":"I now have approximately four separate tangents I'm itching to go down; as I said, race in LotR is a deep subject. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] But instead of muddying the waters here, I'll focus on clarifying my original assertion.\n\nTreating diversity as a moral that a story may or may not choose to center is still looking at the work through context 1--the context of the work by itself.

I have my own perspectives on these sorts of questions but I think the answers to them are far from settled.\n\nI think the effect described in the first paragraph is not necessarily about race specifically, and more about ethnocentrism.  In historical English literature, Frenchmen rarely appear as protagonists, but when they do appear it's frequently as antagonists.  In France I suspect the reverse is true.  I've read folk tale collections from many different countries, and the protagonists are overwhelmingly from the countries in question, while people/creatures from outside the originating culture appear frequently as antagonists.  Even in the artificial worlds of SF&F, humans are overwhelmingly protagonists and when non-humans do appear it's frequently as antagonists.  I would argue that neither content creators nor content consumers have a responsibility to undo this situation, merely to create what they wish and consume what they want.  Creation is too hard, and life is to short, to do otherwise--and the common situation also allows works that go against the ethnocentric grain to stand out, and be selected by those it appeals to.\n\nAt the same time, I certainly think that it's true that harmful racial stereotypes (and for that matter, non-racial stereotypes) can propagate through creative works, and both creators and consumers should be wary of them.  Certainly any works created for the purpose of demonizing a particular ethnic group should be strictly avoided.\n\nWhat about a derivative work set in a particular (fictional) setting?  Do the creators have a responsibility to faithfully reproduce the setting of the original work?  Obviously Peter Jackson felt the answer was no, and if I were to lay a bet on this new show I'd bet against it as well.  Should the creators feel obligated to produce a diverse set of heroes to better reflect the demographics of their target audience than the demographics of Middle Earth?  Of course not, IMO.  But if they did, would it be a disaster?  No way to tell.  If Kahliel were borrowed from FFG and made a major character, with his backstory as a plot element, that'd actually be pretty cool.  If the show had the new member of the Valar, Captain Planet, select a child from each of the peoples of Middle Earth to fight against the evil property developer Sauron, and the male Dunedain child was depicted as uniquely stupid and selfish, it'd be unwatchable drek.  If the show cast the actors without regard to whether their skin colors matched what we'd expect, it'd be startling, but not necessarily bad.  If Gandalf were the focus of the show and was portrayed by a \"person of color\", if the acting and story was good I think it'd be fine as long as Gandalf was still Gandalf.  He didn't become Gandalf the White because of the color of his skin.  But if they did that and made a major plot point how racial prejudice against him impedes Gandalf's efforts to work against Sauron, you've left Middle Earth far behind and returned to a more modern morality play.  This would not bode well, both because it's abandoned the material I love, and because I find most morality plays to be simultaneously insufferable and boring."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3200342","commentId":3200342,"userName":"JJ48","timestamp":1517847070,"content":"I think adapting a work can be tough, because what works in text doesn't always work on screen, and vice-versa.  More important is to retain the theme and feel of a work (or to deviate from it intentionally, if you have your own point to make, I guess).  In this, I actually think Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies did remarkably well, especially when compared to other adaptations like Middle-earth:  Shadow of Mordor.\n\nI will be very interested to see what themes are woven into the show's narrative.  Will we see high hope (the knowledge that, \"in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach\")?  Will faithful service and humility correlate to a character's awesomeness?  Will elven military leaders display even the tiniest bit of tactical know-how, or were all such captains killed off during the Last Alliance?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3201914","commentId":3201914,"userName":"Otherworlder","timestamp":1517925720,"content":"The most culturally and racially respectful and progressive thing to do in Middle-earth is to show Harad and Rhun etc., as civilizationally and culturally distinct from the West yet equals on firm footing.

I thought that FFGs approach to the Haradrim in this cycle was revolutionary and actually quite sophisticated - showing them as culturally more complex than just unthinking baddies. In the last AP which should be appearing any time now, the Gondorian's are shown to be racist - which they actually were. To my mind this subverts just about every previous view of Middle Earth. I do take your point that this cycle could be seen as offensive, but overall I think FFG deserve lots of credit. Had they done as you suggest, they could be criticised for following the trope that \"all coloured people are evil\".\n\nTwo further points:\n\n1) Tolkien didn't detail much about the Haradrim but he deliberately gave Sam famous lines in which he wonders about them and their motivations - hinting that there's more going on than unthinking evil. In my view FFG are following Tolkien's conception.\n\n2) FFG haven't shown all Haradrim as tattered - Na'asiyah in particular is very tough. Others are shown as evil, but in all fairness they're encounter deck cards and not player ones. Overall I do think there's nuance into FFGs conception of the Haradrim. \n\nEdited February 6, 2018 by JonG\nRemove moderately naughty word"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3202569","commentId":3202569,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1517949128,"content":"Tolkien mentions in Appendix A, part I, section v, that after Aragorn's stint as Thorongil, he \"went alone far into the East and deep into the South, exploring the hearts of Men, both evil and good, and uncovering the plots and devices of the servants of Sauron.\"  So it's certainly canonical that good as well as evil was to be found among both Southron and Easterling; and \"uncovering the plots and devices\" also means both that Sauron did not have full control of those two vast areas, and that exposing Sauron's role made those peoples less likely to cooperate.  Even of the subset of Easterlings and Southrons gathered by Sauron to fight directly for him, the most part abandoned his cause once deprived of his will (in \"Field of Cormallen\") -- though there was some even then, \"those that were deepest and longest in evil servitude\" that continued to fight even then, and we know from Appendix A part II that Aragorn & Eomer fought \"beyond the Sea of Rhun and on the far fields of the South\" before \"the White Tree could grow in peace.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263165-new-amazon-show/?do=findComment&comment=3203474","commentId":3203474,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1518010873,"content":"> 19 hours ago, Authraw said:\n> \n> The more I think about it, the more I think I'm ready for some new stories in Middle Earth.
