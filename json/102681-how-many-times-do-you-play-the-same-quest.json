Most of the Mirkwood quests are among my favourites, so I've played them a fair bit, but the Dwarrowdelf ones aren't, so I've only played them once or twice. I'm not the sort of person who plays relentlessly until he wins, many times I've \"lost\" a quest but have put it all away and, usually, enjoyed myself. I currently own everything for this game, and I don't think there is any quest that I feel is \"done\", or whatever. Depending on my mood, I might not tackle one quest for months (or years), but another I might come back to regularly. There are a lot that I have only played once, and there are a lot that I have played many times. That's no real indication of the enjoyment I got from the quest, either: Shadow & Flame was one of my least enjoyable experiences with this game, and Steward's Fear was one of my greatest, and yet I've only played each of these once. \n\n \n\nI see the adventure packs as expansions in the boardgame sense, rather than booster packs of the card game variety, so ignoring the issues of price, the questions is like asking \"how many times do you play Dunwich Horror?\" or whatever. Just because you complete a scenario, does that mean you should never play it again? If you defeated Shudde M'ell, would you never play Dunwich Horror again? Well, possibly. My point is, no matter how many times I've gone through the Hills of Emyn Muil, I never grow tired of it, but I don't play to win, I only play to enjoy myself. Of course, some people enjoy themselves by winning, but I'm in this game for the lore, the sense of epic that it manages to capture. Against that, winning is pretty immaterial. \n\n \n\nAnd that was a pretty long and drawn-out post...!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102681-how-many-times-do-you-play-the-same-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1033643","commentId":1033643,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1396294714,"content":"> Thanks!\n> \n> I play in a grp of 3.

It's way less fun IMO; to me this is a social game.\n\nSo to answer you question, we play every quest until we beat it, and we select any quest we want to do afterwards, as we don't get much play time. Favorites are: massing, FoS, CatC, 7th lvl, WitW & recently, AoO.\n\nAll great multi-player quests.

Invariably I have usually made a mistake that needs correcting.\n\nI like to okay blind versus the encounter deck so I usually change the deck th second time based on what I see etc. like to have 2 soild wins before I move on.\n\nException are the hobbit quests.

Something about fighting several big Trolls while dealing with the potential mess of getting sacked is always fun, though neither quest is that hard when you control your threat/pacing (or throw lots of dwarves at it!). I'll look forward to playing the Nightmare modes of these once I fill out my collection."}]}
