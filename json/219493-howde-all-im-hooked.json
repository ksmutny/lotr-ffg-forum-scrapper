Been trying to get this for ages as the core set is outa stock everywhere but managed to get the core set first 2 expansions and the first cycle set from ebay and all I can say is ....wow.\n\n \n\nGreat solo or with my kids..)) Just a couple of questions if anyone can help.\n\n1. can I put an attachment from 1 hero sphere to another as I had 2 leadership and 1 spirit.\n\n2. on a passage through mirkwood on the last scenario I had to find ungoliant which I finally did but as a shadow card, so can I put him straight into attack after I sort his shadowtext...?????thanx.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219493-howde-all-im-hooked/?do=findComment&comment=2208053","commentId":2208053,"userName":"TheGuardian118","timestamp":1462796852,"content":"Welcome! I'm a new player myself, but I can answer your two questions.\n\n \n\n1. Yes you can. You have to PAY for the attachment from the specific sphere, but once it's paid for it can go on any hero/ally of any player, unless the card text says otherwise. Some attatchments are only on heroes, and some even go on the enemies! (There is one that goes on the monsters, and one that goes on locations in the core set)\n\n \n\n2. If you read the quest card, it says \"When Revealed: Each player must search the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 Spider card of his choice, and add it to the staging area.\n\nThe players must find and defeat Ungoliant's Spawn to win this game\"\n\n \n\nSo you have to fight and kill it, just seeing it as a shadow doesn't count. However, you can search the discard pile, as well as the deck and pick US as your spider. Many new players seem to skip the fact that you can search the discard pile, which is useful if you saw her as a Shadow or killed her earlier."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219493-howde-all-im-hooked/?do=findComment&comment=2209081","commentId":2209081,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1462830824,"content":"Welcome to an awesome game.\n\nYour questions are answered above :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI will add, this game is AWESOME....but.... core set quests are unbalanced with core set cards.\n\nQuest 1 (Mirkwood) is easy-ish and a great introduction.\n\nQuest 2 (Anduin) is awesome and thematic but very hard for a beginer with core cards. Takes some special deck design (or easy mode)\n\nQuest 3 (Dol Guldur) is shockingly hard, still considered one of the games hardest. I never managed it solo.\n\nSo do not disspair if you suddenly find quest very very hard. Its just part of the core set. I found cycle1 quest to be much better balanced and amazing fun.\n\nWelcome to one of the best card games ever!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219493-howde-all-im-hooked/?do=findComment&comment=2209587","commentId":2209587,"userName":"stueyruss","timestamp":1462863544,"content":"Hi and thanx guardian118.

I wrote down the order of the encountercards and which Cards I drew.

I believe the only three cards that have that trait in the core set are King Spider, Forest Spider, and Ungoliants Spawn. If you're solo, then you'll want to pick US so you can win, but if you're two or more players then the others will have to pick something else.  Also, note that you are adding it to the staging area, not revealing it so the \"When Revealed\" effects of whatever is selected will not go off.\n\n \n\nThe trait thing is the same idea as when Longbeard Orc Slayer comes into play and damages all the orcs. Not all orcs have \"Orc\" in their name, but  they will have the trait in their card text. Wolf Rider and Dungeon Jailer come to mind."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219493-howde-all-im-hooked/?do=findComment&comment=2212778","commentId":2212778,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1463001490,"content":"> Alex, I picked up loads of other decks too but am trying to play and defeat in order using the available decks that were out...))) and dol gulder is insane...ive lost so many times even with 2 players we had our asses handed too us...lol\n> \n>  \n> \n> and with this game I don't mind losing everytime is different...might have to quit my job to spend more time playing this....)))))))))))))))))))))\n\nAwesome.\n\nI too bought lots all in one go and have been playing progression style using only the cards available at the time.\n\nI had to skip dol guldur, too hard.\n\nIve been through Mirkwood cycle, Kazahd Dum and its Dwarrowdelf cycle and also one of the print-on-demmand quests , the Osgiliath one.\n\nSo in total I have attempted 19 quests and only passed on dol guldur.\n\nRight now I am on quest1 of the first hobbit saga box, not beaten it yet but I will :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nPlaying progression style like you are is a fantastic choice!!"}]}
