A high Parry will only get you so far. They certainly won't \"never\" get hit. No matter how high your Parry is, the baddies also get a 1 in 12 chance of hitting you (and the good guys are often out-numbered so the bad guys tend to get more opportunities to roll attacks).

I'm reporting the concesus my gaming group came to (including me) based on playing.\n\nI do know the hobbit is better than an elf in combat (based on seeing how good the hobit was and trying to work out a build that could match it with the elf) . I mean I wasn't playing an optimised elf combat character, but I couldn't see a way of making one that was better than the hobbit. Reliabily only getting hit 1/12 (and the point is the hobbit can get better odds than that to attack the enemy) really made up for it.\n\nAlso their special sword is rediculous. "}]}
