Then, you choose 20 other player cards that are neutral or from that sphere and are not more Gandalfs (at least not the Core set one) and add them to the deck. Then, you upload that deck and try it against any quest of your choice, even a fan-made one,Â in any mode you want, and put your score here. There will be no competition (at least not organized by me), this will be just for fun.;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"}]}
