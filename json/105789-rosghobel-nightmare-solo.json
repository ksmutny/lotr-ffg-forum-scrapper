And i think i had goodluck.\n\n \n\nI played Theodred, Aragorn Lore and Beravor.\n\nI used 2 strider's path (reveal locations here is goodluck); i used hernamanth and when i saw the bats (2hp) i used Specting Mischief; i used gandalf 2 times to kill the orc; i used... 3! Imladris Lore, and 1 athelas, and 1 warden healing ... to heal Willyador, Sword Broken, Steward Gondor, Celebrian and test of will...., one time Needway... uf! The perfect hand (i draw by beravor), and enough resources to do it (théodred)..., but otherway... impossible i think.\n\n \n\nHow about? Anyone has won it by diferent way?\n\n \n\nPD: if one creature reaches to be revealed and added to staging the lost game is sure.\n\nPD2: last round i saw a creature was coming (with Hernamanth); i used Shadow Past to return a treachery (the one that damage 2hp to each exhausted) and i was going to cancel it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. Free round (i had the just wp to pass to 3a, if enemy or location was added to staging i didnt win that round) then...., but thanks to the perfect hand.\n\nEdited May 8, 2014 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105789-rosghobel-nightmare-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1077340","commentId":1077340,"userName":"kyrie","timestamp":1399568852,"content":"This is indeed a very difficult quest solo. I won after eight attempts, using Elrond, Glorfindel (Spirit), and Faramir (he works well for the lore healing cards and for ranged attack/defense)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105789-rosghobel-nightmare-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1078011","commentId":1078011,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1399596458,"content":"Just have to get lucky.
