Oh, and then I read the part where we're going to the ruins of Numenor. On top of which it's all new and different stuff.

With the rest of the current cycle supposedly supporting the Noldor discard mechanic, by the time Cirdan is released the discard requirement might actually be a positive, if it isn't already.

Some cards will get stronger depending how many copies of the same card are in the discard pile (this will be interesting as at most there can only be 2 in the discard pile due to the limit of 3 of any card in a deck) which is pretty cool, sort of the opposite to some of the encounter effects in Deadmen's Dike. Then we have cards that will grow more powerful depending on what the top card of our discard pile is. This also sounds really cool and could encourage deckbuilding with few events (so that the top card of your discard stays the same for as long as possible) or allows cards like Erestor or Cirdan himself to boost this effect as when you discard your hand from Erestors effect I imagine you can choose the order, similarly Cirdan makes you discard a card (after you get to draw an additional one) so each turn you can make sure the card on top of your discard pile is one that will boost the card with this new mechanic. \n\nI really really like the sound of these effects."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186145-next-deluxe-expansion-the-grey-havens/?do=findComment&comment=1755926","commentId":1755926,"userName":"jnicol","timestamp":1440559793,"content":"This looks amazing!

When testing my (albeit ridiculous) proof-of-concept Erestor Deck [https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/deck-revenge-of-the-nerds/], I was often drawing through the deck within 4 or 5 rounds. If I were to switch Éowyn for Círdan, that deck will only get more silly. I am really interested to make a less silly version of that deck with the new victory display shenanigans. If you can draw your deck consistently in 5 rounds, it seems much more viable to plan on having the 9 removal events (plus Keen as Lances) as the engine of a strategy. In any case, I designed this card below for Ian's \"invent a sphere\" contest a while back. Looking at it now, it is a bit over-powered at 0 and should probably cost 1 resource, but I feel like the idea is solid. Here's hoping that we get more recursion in the next cycle.\n\n \n\nsong-of-the-hunt-front-face.jpg?w=640&h= [https://hallofbeorn.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/song-of-the-hunt-front-face.jpg?w=640&amp;h=874]\n\nEdited August 27, 2015 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186145-next-deluxe-expansion-the-grey-havens/?do=findComment&comment=1758087","commentId":1758087,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1440649350,"content":"Cool card and idea, like the art on that too.

Unless some unknown event or attachment keeps her relevant, I doubt she'll find a way into discard decks. I love Elrond but I'm not convinced Vilya fits with Erestor. Not saying every card slot in a Noldor deck has to contribute to the discard mechanic (and in a way I suppose every card does in a simple sense), but as I believe I've mentioned earlier I don't think Cirdan+Elrond+Erestor is a good hero line-up unless you've got tons of threat reduction.

This type of vessel is generally suitable for inland waters or harbors and not suitable for the open ocean.  This is because there is a lot of weight “up high” that can cause the vessel to get unwieldy very quickly in dirty weather.  Also, while this sail type is very efficient in light winds, that same feature can make it too powerful in heavy air.  Anyway, I’ve been studying the art and it is bothering me that there is no rigging holding up the lateen spar!  At least not that I can see.  Invisible elven rope perhaps?  So I decided to go and look at the art on the cards again and noticed something I hadn’t seen before.\n\n \n\nWhile Dreamchaser has the traits “Gray Havens. Ship”, the other two ships we can see in Dreamchaser’s fleet, Silver Wing and Dawn Star, have the traits “Gondor.  Ship.”  So I am changing my opinion that we won’t be visiting Umbar from probably not to quite possibly so.  Have to hedge my bets.  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\nIncidentally, the central ship – a boat really – on the box art isn’t on any of the player cards spoiled so far."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186145-next-deluxe-expansion-the-grey-havens/?do=findComment&comment=1797115","commentId":1797115,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1442344131,"content":"> Hahah, you mean BGG, the place where MNT went after he was banned here for no good reason? \n\nOk, that explains a lot."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186145-next-deluxe-expansion-the-grey-havens/?do=findComment&comment=1804992","commentId":1804992,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1442601265,"content":"I actually teamed up with several people to report him and get him banned.
