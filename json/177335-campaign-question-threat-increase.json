That leaves 2 open hero slots if I keep Gandalf.\n\nSo, Will I get the threat penalty for selecting 2 new heroes when playing campaign rules, even though I've been somewhat forced to open up these 2 hero slots?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177335-campaign-question-threat-increase/?do=findComment&comment=1629674","commentId":1629674,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1432149850,"content":"I wanna say you don't get the penalty for Aragorn? It's in the rule insert for sure. Your captive is in play and you don't replace him with another hero. You're basically playing 2 heroes and Fellowship Aragorn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177335-campaign-question-threat-increase/?do=findComment&comment=1629749","commentId":1629749,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1432153090,"content":"No threat penalty, it does say in the rules insert that you can replace Aragorn specifically without getting the +threat.\n\n \n\nYou can't change Sam though, he will be the captive hero in your Uruk-hai quest.  You will play that quest with only 2 heroes (3 counting Fellowship Aragorn).\n\n \n\nThen once you get to Helm's Deep, you can change anybody you like without +threat.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177335-campaign-question-threat-increase/?do=findComment&comment=1629814","commentId":1629814,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1432155159,"content":"Okay thanks, missed the part about the captive hero.
