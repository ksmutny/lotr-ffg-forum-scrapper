In 3B you both have your own quest right?\n\nYou are both considered to be playing seperate until one of you joins the other again.\n\nThe same thing, sort of, was asked some time ago with Elladan & Elrohir, I remember.\n\nAnd I'm quite sure it got sumbitted and this was the official response:\n\n\"They don't give their bonuses anymore if player 1 controls one, and player 2 the other on stage 3B.\"\n\nSo with that reasoning, I would say the one who has Bilbo gets to draw a card until 4B.\n\n \n\n2. As the nameless card simply states \"attach\" not \"reveal\" or \"put into play\" or anything, I'd say there's no problem attaching it. The attached cards are not really in play on their own.  That's my reasoning though, and might be open to discussion.\n\nEdited January 29, 2014 by Noccus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98024-foundatins-of-stone-my-last-questions/?do=findComment&comment=967781","commentId":967781,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1391012257,"content":"1. Well, there is still only one first player, so it's sure the other players cannot draw cards with Bilbo, but I'm not sure that the one who control it would draw the card each turn...\n\n \n\n2.
