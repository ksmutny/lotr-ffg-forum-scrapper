There aren't that many big communities for this game, more so a million tiny pockets of solo players or small groups of friends that play. Stores that exist in areas where not many people play the game might not stock or support the game but that is by no means an indication of how the game is doing overall or worldwide and is more just indicative of your local community and the fact that almost no one in it plays this game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233242-2nd-edition/?do=findComment&comment=2475158","commentId":2475158,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1477471761,"content":">  \n> \n> > Second edition announcement: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/8/2/enter-the-mythos/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/8/2/enter-the-mythos/]\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > The game is dying...\n> \n> I don't think it's dying but two of the lead designers, now working on the Arkham Horror game said that they built it based on what they learned from their mistakes and by that they meant the old LCGs and showed a prominently large LOTR box....I'm looking into it as a solo game as I can't make it to my FLGS open game nights and it's really not looking that compelling.  Maybe Rundbound 3rd ed?\n> \n>  \n\nYeah he was joking.....
