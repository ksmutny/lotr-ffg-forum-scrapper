For example you are at Stage 2A and the forced effect says the next Stage C, and the next Stage C card in the quest deck is Stage 2C, so you put that in play?\n\nOr is it the next Stage A / C up? As in, you are at Stage 2A. The travel forced effect says next Stage C, so you go to Stage 3C.\n\ncheers\n\nEdited August 1, 2018 by NPAW"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280103-i%E2%80%99m-still-lost-in-effing-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=3422726","commentId":3422726,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1533158644,"content":"I’m pretty sure, keeping with the spirit of theme, that you’re intended to advance in the latter manner you described.

Depending on what you explored, you will advance to either 3A, then flip to 3B, or you will advance to 3C and then flip to 3D.\n\nThere should still be 2 objective locations left in the deck at this point (in play or in the encounter deck/discard pile). If there are not, you did something wrong (?).\n\nTravel to another objective location.  You are now on either 4A or 4C, and will flip to 4B or 4D accordingly, which have the scenario win conditions.\n\nThere should still remain one objective location which you did not travel to at this point. You don't need it.\n\n----------\n\nOne more thing that might help to clarify: if you get to 2C, you *skip* 2A.  If you get to 3A, you're going to be *skipping* 3C.  You do not need to clear every quest card -- in any given playthrough, you will only be completing half of the quest deck.  Gives the scenario some replayability.  There are other scenarios like this as well, where you don't advance through every quest card in order to win the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280103-i%E2%80%99m-still-lost-in-effing-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=3625158","commentId":3625158,"userName":"Dlogue","timestamp":1550213293,"content":"That makes sense.
