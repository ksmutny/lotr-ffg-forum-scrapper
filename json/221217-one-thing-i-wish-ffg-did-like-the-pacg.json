Rubber bands or Go7 (or other; I get that particular brand direct from the maker cheaply) inserts are the safest way to organise the Pathfinder card games and not have a total mess. The core boxes are more designed to hold the small expansion packs than stacks of cards, and even then they don't hold them well if you move the box around."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221217-one-thing-i-wish-ffg-did-like-the-pacg/?do=findComment&comment=2240283","commentId":2240283,"userName":"JohnGarrison1870","timestamp":1464546884,"content":"Hoping FFG provides a decent insert for any game is likely a pipe dream, indeed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221217-one-thing-i-wish-ffg-did-like-the-pacg/?do=findComment&comment=2240945","commentId":2240945,"userName":"divinityofnumber","timestamp":1464593159,"content":"I'd rather have them put the effort into the game itself.
