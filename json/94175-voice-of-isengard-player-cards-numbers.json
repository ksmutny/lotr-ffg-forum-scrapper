They seem to be going in the following sequence: heroes, allies, attachments, events, and below is the list...\n\n \n\n1 Éomer, Tactics hero\n\n2\n\n3 Saruman, Neutral ally\n\n4 Orthanc Guard, Leadership ally\n\n5\n\n6 Westfold Outrider, Tactics ally\n\n7\n\n8 Rohan Warhorse, Tactics attachment\n\n9\n\n10 Keys of Orthanc, Neutral attachment\n\n11 Legacy of Númenor, Leadership event\n\n12 Deep Knowledge, Lore event\n\n \n\nI believe this is the first time we are seeing two neutral cards in a box. Also, I predict cards 13 & 14 will be player cards also (namely events). It might be that each sphere gets three cards (including heroes, as in Khazad-dum) but we've already seen three for Tactics. Heirs of Númenor didn't have equal spheral distribution though...\n\n...even with the predicted 14 card total, it only leaves six more to spoil.\n\nEdited November 27, 2013 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94175-voice-of-isengard-player-cards-numbers/?do=findComment&comment=917667","commentId":917667,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1385555780,"content":"we will surely see a good few more events in that 6....i think the doomed is the main feature of this pack and this works best with events.\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94175-voice-of-isengard-player-cards-numbers/?do=findComment&comment=917670","commentId":917670,"userName":"Dedalus","timestamp":1385556095,"content":"I came up with this list:\n\n001 - Eomer\n\n003 - Saruman\n\n004 - Orthanc Guard\n\n006 - Westfold Outrider\n\n008 - Rohan Warhorse\n\n010 - Keys of Orthanc\n\n011 - Legacy of Numenor\n\n012 - Deep Knowledge\n\n037 - The Forest's Malice\n\n043 - Dunlending Bandit\n\n045 - Old Hatreds\n\n046 - Dunland Tribesman\n\n048 - Dunland Berserker\n\n058 - In Need of Rest\n\n060b - Dunlending Attack\n\nAll cards are from FFG announcements.\n\nEdited November 27, 2013 by Dedalus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94175-voice-of-isengard-player-cards-numbers/?do=findComment&comment=917676","commentId":917676,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1385556502,"content":"Yeah, it seems my poor eye-sight confused 8 for 9 concerning the Warhorse.\n\nIt is also interesting to see all the previewed encounter cards are numbered quite high, so they may all be from the latter sets.\n\nEdited November 27, 2013 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94175-voice-of-isengard-player-cards-numbers/?do=findComment&comment=917739","commentId":917739,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1385561509,"content":"I was sorta looking into this too. If wouldn't me surprised if they started to standardize the boxes to have 1 of each type of card for each sphere and then 2 heroes that can be whatever sphere. Also throw in 2 neutral cards? I don't know if that's what they're doing but it would be nice to have that kind of standard setup, like they do with the APs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94175-voice-of-isengard-player-cards-numbers/?do=findComment&comment=917799","commentId":917799,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1385566412,"content":"Yeah, it would make sense. What we are likely going to see though, is that each sphere gets 3 cards, including the heroes, because there are only six slots left for allies and attachments combined. If that holds, then Tactics is all settled and Spirit gets three out of the six not yet revealed, together with one for Leadership and two for Lore. It would also mean that either Lore or Spirit gets two events (particularly fit for the latter).\n\nEdited November 27, 2013 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94175-voice-of-isengard-player-cards-numbers/?do=findComment&comment=917819","commentId":917819,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1385567954,"content":"As an aside, I am starting to put together a Lore deck and may proxy in Deep Knowledge aforetime."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94175-voice-of-isengard-player-cards-numbers/?do=findComment&comment=917853","commentId":917853,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1385569930,"content":"I couldn't resist the temptation, either. I've tried several of the previewed cards. I especially like the Outrider in mono-Tactics, it is another way for such a deck to overcome the willpower deficit (and it is beautifully versatile). The two events (Legacy and Knowledge) look strongest of the set so far, but I am yet to utilize them properly.
