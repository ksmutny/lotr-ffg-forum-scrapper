Stupid neighbours of mine.. Buy English versions! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I hate German grammar! (scored a 1,0 on my last 'write a German letter' -test.) There are actually three versions as far as I know, English, German and Chinese. Why the Germans need their own version.. ;P There is no Dutch, no French, no Spanish (way bigger language), No Ukrainian, No Swedish, No Polish, No Russian .... I could go on and on, but the Germans want their own. I don't want to offend anybody, so I won't make any stupid WOII jokes and just wonder why it's taking so long to release German stuff then? Mirkwood cycle was roughly three years ago!"}]}
