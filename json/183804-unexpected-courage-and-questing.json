Similarly, while you cannot double-attack the same character, you can attack one enemy, use a readying effect and then attack another enemy afterwards (like a double attack) but the rulebook does say that you are no longer attacking once your attack resolves, so just like you say the \"state\" is no longer in effect when you use an ability to then attack another enemy.\n\nSo thanks for your info yes, I fully agree and understand :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] though there are aspects where slight confusion can creep in :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nCheers Alogs!\n\nAlex"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183804-unexpected-courage-and-questing/?do=findComment&comment=1718932","commentId":1718932,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1438660284,"content":"> Also, commit is a state / boolean, either true or false. \"Double commit\" or \"Double\" attack/defense does not exist.\n\nBoolean?
