I am aware that there are many blogs and sites that provide the same thing. There are only two words that I can address to their makers and owners - THANK YOU! \n\n \nThe Anvil is my free-time project for all those who want to have hobby resources related to card and board games at one place so they can browse through their e-collections. So, The Anvil will not provide reviews but just downloads of the resources that are already on the internet. You may wonder - \"so what's the **** difference?\". It is very simple - I like to have cards, rules, etc. on my computer, and I think that I am not alone.\n\nI DO NOT own any rights related to the games. I am using hobby material that is already on the internet, and I am spending a significant amount of time to collect-download-save-edit-upload-post the material that I found.\n\nI RESPECT every site or blog with the same purpose and The Anvil IS NOT something that would decrease importance of the other sites and blogs.\n\nI SUPPORT hobby related companies with bying their products.\n\nVisit, share, comment, don't hate, have fun.\n\nhttp://www.theeanvil.blogspot.com [http://www.theeanvil.blogspot.com]\n\n \n\n\n \nEdited November 27, 2013 by Dedalus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94172-the-anvil-blog/?do=findComment&comment=927341","commentId":927341,"userName":"Dedalus","timestamp":1386681994,"content":"Update:\n\nThe Drúadan Forest is no longer version 1.0. \n\nAll card scans from The Drúadan Forest are uploaded."}]}
