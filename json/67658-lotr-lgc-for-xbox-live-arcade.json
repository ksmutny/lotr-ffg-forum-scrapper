The makers of the Shadow Era [http://www.shadowera.com/] card game are making money hand over fist through micro transactions (a dollar here, 5 there), despite having a totally underwhelming game. Even though it is far below the Game of Thrones LCG, or even MTG, I have still dropped $40 on it because I like being able to play games on my phone, whenever I want, against other people.\n\nNettrunner really should have been done all online."}]}
