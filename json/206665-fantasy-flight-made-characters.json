I would love to see more FFG created characters in future, as we missing some for certain factions. As mentioned already above we have:\n\n \n\nNoldor: ----\n\nSilvan: Mirlonde, Rossiel, Argalad\n\nGondor: Eleanor, Caldara\n\nRohan: ----\n\nHobbits: ----\n\nDunedain: Beravor, Idraen, Amarthiul\n\nDwarves: Thalin\n\nDale: Lanwyn\n\nBeornings: ----\n\n \n\nSo hopefully we will see a Hobbit, Beorning, Rohan and Noldor FFG created heroes in future expansions . Would be nice to see also Silvan Spirit hero as there are none so far."}]}
