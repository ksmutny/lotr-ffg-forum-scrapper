I was playing the Road to Rivendell solo (actually in Nightmare, but the same would be true of Standard mode). Quest 1A set-up states \"Put Arwen Undomiel into play ... Reveal 1 card from the encounter deck per player...\". The card revealed was Followed by Night (\"WR: The first player (choose 1): deals 1 damage to all allies in play and Followed by Night gains surge, or all enemies engaged with players make an immediate attack, if able\").  With no enemies engaged, I chose the latter option. When I staged during round 1, the next card revealed was a second Followed by Night - so had I chosen the first option at setup, I would have immediately lost.\n\nNow I know that Followed by Night has different wording to some cards with a \"must either  X or Y\" choice (where the FAQ section 1.44 states you must choose one you can do in full if able).\n\nHowever, I just came across the MEC01 Online Only Rules statement (under the Effects heading):\n\n\"If an ability instructs a player to select among multiple effects, an effect that has the potential to change the game state must be selected.\"\nSo, what does that mean for my choice above?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286859-0-round-loss/?do=findComment&comment=3548983","commentId":3548983,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1543325587,"content":"It means on both occasions you would have been forced to select the first option of the treachery, since the second option would not have had any effect.
