Just play Narya first.\n\nWithout Narya it's definitely not possible, and even with the ring you might wonder if the Leadership resource icon granted by it is enough to consider Gandalf as \"belonging to any sphere of influence\".\n\nIn any case even if it was possible it might not be worth it since then OHUH Gandalf cannot target itself with the ring and since it has very good stats there might not be better choices than itself."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300465-narya-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=3793629","commentId":3793629,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1569499698,"content":"Apart from any considerations of whether it is worth it… The general consensus has indeed been that it is legal to play first Narya, then Sword-thain, on (either!) ally Gandalf. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300465-narya-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=3793735","commentId":3793735,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1569511973,"content":"I would not play Narya and Sword-thain on Core Gandalf, as he is discarded at the end of the round, unless you find a way to blank his textbox."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300465-narya-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=3793902","commentId":3793902,"userName":"caribecards","timestamp":1569523432,"content":"Thank you guys,\n\nThe question was thinking using Gandalf (Over Hill and Under Hill) , and the idea is to use Narya to ready him, it's just what I need.\n\nHowever using sword-thain is a good idea too.\n\n \n\nEdited September 26, 2019 by caribecards"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300465-narya-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=3794306","commentId":3794306,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1569562847,"content":"> 14 hours ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> I would not play Narya and Sword-thain on Core Gandalf, as he is discarded at the end of the round, unless you find a way to blank his textbox.\n\nBesides the dubious strategic choice I think Sappidus was simply making a point about how it would still technically be possible to do it if someone really wanted.
