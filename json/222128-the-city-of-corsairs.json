That can come in handy.\n\nI like the Imrahil Silvan deck idea.\n\nI just looked it up, the Elrond ally does NOT have the noble trait... bummer.\n\nRed deck questing is becoming a thing, and I definitely approve. I like color identity as much as anyone, but certain aspects of the game (like questing) are too indispensable to be eliminated from a color. Imrahil is a good questing hero because his ability still applies while exhausted. I think this is one of the most important areas in the game to improve and I'm happy to see that the designers agree.\n\nI love power decking and it seems that Outlands has no cieling. The pack does not, however, actually improve the trait. Unlike Silvans, Outlands does not benefit from allies coming in and out of play, so Imrahil does not fit even with the title. Also, the title grants one extra resource a round, which is nice, but at a cost of 3 it takes three rounds to break even. If you compare that to leadership Denethor the contest is a complete joke.

The pack does not, however, actually improve the trait. Unlike Silvans, Outlands does not benefit from allies coming in and out of play, so Imrahil does not fit even with the title. Also, the title grants one extra resource a round, which is nice, but at a cost of 3 it takes three rounds to break even. If you compare that to leadership Denethor the contest is a complete joke. Outlands decks don't take that long to destroy quests so the title is not even worth playing. Oh well.\n\nYes, the attachment does not do much for Outlands. Except, the allies will leave play in such a deck if you want it or not -- and thus Leadership Imrahil, with the attachment, will usually get to use two of his boosted stats, so the cost might be worth it… but again, I do not see myself trying it..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222128-the-city-of-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2258876","commentId":2258876,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1465462922,"content":"Giving a hero with action advantage an Outlands trait is kinda bonkers to be honest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222128-the-city-of-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2258965","commentId":2258965,"userName":"FetaCheese","timestamp":1465469859,"content":"Is new Imrahil a severe case of sphere bleed?

The other examples should work though.

Why the b÷;@/y heck doesn't anyone remember poor Halbarad?\n\n \n\nHalbarad is quite likely to show up in Flame of the West, but I think most people are mentioning Beregond because the Battle of Pelennor Fields is a big moment for Gondor, so it seems likely that we'll get a Gondor hero (like Theoden in Treason of Saruman). With Denethor and Imrahil now quite unlikely as heroes in the saga, Beregond is the most prominent Gondor character from the first half of Return of the King. On the other hand, Beregond doesn't participate in the battle. A Leadership Eomer hero would also fit, but might make the box too Rohan-focused (so we might get an Eomer ally). Given that the quests focus on the Grey Company, a Spirit Halbarad hero is definitely posssible (and the Dunedain are thematically connected to Gondor). At this point I expect an Imrahil ally (Leadership?), and Beregond, Halbarad, and Eomer characters to show up. That leaves space for one (or two, if one of the above doesn't show up) more ally, who might be Merry, Denethor, or the twins."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222128-the-city-of-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2260347","commentId":2260347,"userName":"soullos","timestamp":1465513819,"content":"Sneak attack on a stick for a hero ability is pretty nice, especially because it can be used when exhausted.\n\n \n\nAnother hero specific attachment?
