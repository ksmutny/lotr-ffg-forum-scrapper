My playing partner has used a character to sentinel against one of the attackers that are engaged with me. On revealing the shadow card, it says \"Defending player must discard their hand.\" Now who is considered the defending player?\n\nÂ \n\nI have taken it thus far to mean that I am still the defending 'Player' although my partner has used her 'character' to defend for me thus I discard my hand.
