I will try to answer your question.\n\n \n\nThere are several limitations on when you can play cards.\n\n1. Allies and Attachments can only be played during the planning phase.\n\n2. Events can be played during any phase.\n\n \n\nOn various Allies, Attachments, and Events you may notice there are Actions and Responses. These are different.\n\n1. Actions can only be triggered during a valid window for player actions.\n\n2. Responses interrupt the flow of the game, and the only restriction is that they must be triggered immediately after the condition specified on the card. If you continue on with the game in any way then it is too late to go back and trigger the response.\n\n \n\nSo when are the valid window for player actions? This is something that took a while for me to learn, and when you are starting out it helps to have a reference handy. There is a chart at the end of the rulebook but it isn't very detailed. I've been using this: http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf]\n\n \n\nAs you can see the staging step is all red, meaning no Actions can be triggered while the cards are being revealed. The only thing you can do is trigger appropriate Responses, like Eleanor or Test of Will. A passive effect, like the one on Thalin, will also work.\n\n \n\nNow, there are exceptions to these rules, like when an enemy makes an attack as part of its \"when revealed\" effect (this opens up the opportunity to perform actions), but generally the cards themselves will let you know.\n\n \nAgain, welcome to the game and to the community!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182455-treachery-card-question/?do=findComment&comment=1692516","commentId":1692516,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1436909984,"content":"So to distill all that for ya, yep Gloin would have to die :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  (Sorry Gloin!)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182455-treachery-card-question/?do=findComment&comment=1692612","commentId":1692612,"userName":"Dsbessie","timestamp":1436917296,"content":"Thanks to both of you for the responses.
