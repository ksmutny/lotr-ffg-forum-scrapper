Core rules, p. 25: \"Card effects do not interact with cards in an out of play state unless the effect specifically refers to that state.\" (This also applies to the victory display.)\n\nI do find the illegal idea of using Ride to Ruin to discard whatever Rohan ally from your deck to place 3 progress tokens pretty amusing, though.\n\nEdited February 8, 2016 by sappidus"}]}
