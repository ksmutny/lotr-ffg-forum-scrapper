Generally speaking, the AP of the Dwarrowdelf cycle offer excellent value for your money, since they combine interesting quests with excellent player cards. In terms of balance between those two, I'd say that the Dwarrowdelf is the best cycle in the game so far, even though both Against the Shadow and Ring Maker have their moments, notably The Steward's Fear AP, which is i.m.o. the pinnacle of this game in terms of quest + player cards in a single package."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129249-dwarrowdelf/?do=findComment&comment=1373533","commentId":1373533,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1419039521,"content":"Second cycle have a very good quests. And un Nmode **** even better!!! Maybe currently is the best cycle now!"}]}
