I have the 3 Lore Songs and the 3 Lore of Imladris event cards for the healing.  I use the two leadership Sylvan archers that provide ranged.  I added all these cards (and the miner that gets rid of a condition) after the release of JtR.  To better my chances of drawing these, I have a couple Ancient Mathoms (useful in all the quests really) and, in JtR,  I use Gandalf for drawing purposes primarily. \n\nWith every expansion pack I keep hoping to get blue or purple cards that heal or better archers, but no luck so far.  I've considered adding the Leadership D. Cache card to give one of the heroes ranged, but it would be completely useless in all other scenarios, and I usually lose from wandering around trying to find the athelas rather than bats and the birds.  The bats aren't too bad as you can block them with W, but the birds are a pain.  I've had to break down and have Gandalf kill the birds with direct damage on entry before.\n\nI think this also helps me make the point of why I don't think sideboards are a good idea if you want the challenge.  These cards would be sitting in the sideboard and swapped in for JtR only...and the deck would be more powerful in the other quests.\n\nI'll post my deck and thoughts behind it when I get a few extra minutes.  By the way, I'm not claiming it's the be all/end all of decks.  It's just one that has some versatility and I enjoy playing.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56290-shadows-of-mirkwood-going-the-distance-with-one-deck/?do=findComment&comment=556364","commentId":556364,"userName":"player582283","timestamp":1321380770,"content":"booored said:\n\n \n\nYea, like if you fail a certain amount of times at a given quest you should fail the quest chain and have to start form the beginning?\n\n \n\n \n\nYep - that sounds right.  I'll probably stick with my one and move on until I get through cycle successfully though...then I'll try to prove consistency!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56290-shadows-of-mirkwood-going-the-distance-with-one-deck/?do=findComment&comment=556389","commentId":556389,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1321387448,"content":"How about....\n\nPoints System For Quest Chain Variant\n\n1) Simple \"win/loss\" records for each quest.\n\n2) If you win a quest you add the difficulty value to your score.

I like what you said about 3 losses in a cycle (presumably meaning 3 losses going through the 6 quests of SoM and you have to play each one til you win it.), but I did not follow you on the second half.\n\nSome things to consider when we define the rules for this variant...\n\n1) Should there be a side board? I strongly suggest no. Having the ability to customize your deck against the quest goes against the challenge of making a deck that can deal with each quest and the different obstacles they throw at you.\n\n\n2) Should you fail a quest to many times do you fail the entire quest chain? I like the idea of losing the cycle on the third loss. Thematically you can think of it as being delayed, injured, whatever enough that Gollum gets away and, and the path is cold.\n\n\n3) How should points be awarded for quests? Should we use the official system (to much work) Should we use a simple win/lose point value? I personally don't like either scoring system, but that is just me. I do like Booored's suggestion of + Difficulty value for the win and - 1/2 Difficulty value for a loss. Keep it simple would be my mantra here...and to me the emphasis should be on getting throught the different quests successfully, not did I do it in a 3 turn rush or I managed to get to -57 threat.\n\n\n4) Should the Variant be only single cycles? Or should it be for ALL cycles. Meaning, that the current variant, means you need a deck for Core+SoM+Osgilliath. Or should the variant mean you have Core OR SoM OR Osgiliath. Or could this just be your choice. I'd go with choice on this one though obviously if you're comparing results it's a heck of a lot more impressive if your deck not only handled SoM but the core cycle with EfDG!\n\n5) Should the variant restict card pool? As in if you are playing SoM quest chain, should you be limited to ONLY the player cards that were released during Core-SOM period.. so no Khazad dum / Darrowdelf. Though if you are playing 2nd option, you can use any cards to the current compleated set (2nd option being that you can chose to play either single cycles or everything up to the end of a full cycle; I'd say this is another choice that you sync with folks if you are doing a competition. To me the key is that you can't add cards once you start a cycle. I can tell you that if I finally get another stud Leadership ally in KD, it will go into my deck on the first cycle restart!\n\nWhat do you think?
