Exhaust Great Yew Bow and attached hero to make a ranged attack against that enemy. Declare attached hero as the attacker. No other attackers can be declared for this attack.”\n\nEven a slightly tooled up Legolas (or Bard for that matter) is going to do lots of fun damage with that. I also like that it's subtley less good than Hands Upon the Bow, because it can't be used to trim the staging area during questing, as it's a Combat Action. It's very nice.\n\nThoughts on Bombur?

It is also of note that Bard's threat cost is 11. Spirit is very valuable to keep the threat low and enemies in the staging area for combat, or send them there via Light in the Dark. Good that Hands Upon the Bow has by no means become obsolete.\n\nI am so glad we get a proper Bombur, the ally version was quite terrible. This one is an instant thematic success.
