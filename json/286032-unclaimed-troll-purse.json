If you want to use the Troll Purse effect you have to find it before killing all the trolls. It's not so easy to recover the treasures on this quest, mainly up to encounter deck luck (or lack of it)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286032-unclaimed-troll-purse/?do=findComment&comment=3534005","commentId":3534005,"userName":"Orcstalker","timestamp":1542124489,"content":"Thanks to all for the clarification......this is tricky if one wants the treasures of the cave, but why play it out if not for those goodies. I'll give it another go."}]}
