Played passage through Mirkwood. However I've got a few questions I'm unsure about . . . \n\n \n\n1. Is there a limit to hand size for players?\n\n \n\n2. Is there a limit to how many cards can be in the staging area at any one time?\n\n \n\n3. Do I assume monsters engaged with players DON'T count to the threat level when questing?\n\n \n\n4. If you use the Gandalf card and deal 4 damage to a creature, does it take its armour value off or is that 4 hit points of damage?\n\n \n\n5. Eomers ability is to add a resource to any hero on the quest with him. Can that include him?\n\n \n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\n \n\nRegards\n\n \n\nLorimez"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107223-nublet-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1098386","commentId":1098386,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1401133109,"content":"Hi,\n\nGreat that you like the game!\n\nAs for your questions:\n\n1.
