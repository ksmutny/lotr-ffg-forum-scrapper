I hope he has lowish threat and decent willpower, since so many Leadership heroes recently are combat focused in their stats, like Amarthiúl and Denethor (both of which are excellent heroes btw).

At first I thought Hirgon, but since we just got Denethor and are getting Imrahil it's doubtful we'll se another Gondor hero. Rohan or Noldor would be my guesses.

I could see Mablung and Damrod, but both of them have good (and quite now) hero versions. Haldir is one, but he doesn´t fit in leadership. No (I think) named Dale characters except Brand is alive during the time period, and Dale seems to have multiple scouts (Lanwyn, Ravenhill Scout and Celduin Traveller). Aragorn could be a scout, and Elladan/Elrohir/Halbarad, but of them only Elladan lacks a leadership version. The Rohan warrior Ceorl could be a scout too, he´s a too minor character to became a hero (I think).\n\n \n\nAs Haldir is a scout, maybe one of his brothers (Rúmil and Orophin) will be promoted into a scout hero. Legolas seems more like a warrior to me, but it is an option.\n\nAnother candidate is Hirgon, the gondorian rider who carried the red arrow to Théoden.

While \"facedown\", you only consider the Lost Island/Temple of the Deceived side of it.\n\n \n\nTravel costs are effects worded as \"Travel: blablabla\". You have to complete them in order to travel to the location. In this case, the Travel cost of Temple is that you have to exhaust the Gate Key. If you travel through the caverns to the Temple, it'sjust a reminder that you still have to actually exhaust the Key to go there."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222753-temple-of-the-deceived/?do=findComment&comment=2366362","commentId":2366362,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1471279604,"content":"About the aimless wandering treachury, Maybe i was not clear\n\nI.e, the first card that i draw from the encounter deck is it, i am at top left, so one uncharted to the left and one to the bottom.

No, the treachery does not suggest a willpower of 4. It says X, where X is the number of Uncharted locations. If you start at the top left and only have 2 uncharted locations in the staging area (one to the right and once below), you only have to remove characters with a total of 2 willpower."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222753-temple-of-the-deceived/?do=findComment&comment=2366471","commentId":2366471,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1471282034,"content":"Oh, then i made my life more difficult.

Wow, I mean it's no Carn Dum, but I thought it was fairly difficult in single player, as you can't divide the guardians among players.\n\n \n\nI agree it was very difficult for me to beat, in fact i am not sure i have ever beaten in solo without tweaking the rules to remove the time penalties. I play one deck solo and hate building a deck which is totally specific to beating one scenario although i do build themed decks. Maybe that is why i am finding the Ringmaker cycle a rather disappointing experience for its high difficulty levels. It has rather put me off buying any more cycles at all now as they seem to have upped the difficulty well beyond the Dwarrowdelf levels. Note I didn't buy Numenor or that cycle as the theme didnt excite me. Maybe there are some more adventure like scenarios out there i would like and Temple looks like one of the better ones."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222753-temple-of-the-deceived/?do=findComment&comment=2383918","commentId":2383918,"userName":"Crusaderlord","timestamp":1472120030,"content":"> I've played this a few times now and would like to add to my comments.  In some ways this is the best mono-tactics quest to be released since we left Gondor.  There really is no chance of location lock because the number and threat from locations stays constant.  So even in tactics you can build up a team of questers in order to brave the perils of the island.  The encounter deck only consists of enemies (tactics forte) and treacheries which aren't too bad.\n> \n>  \n> \n> For my part I have really been enjoying the sailing quests, and this quest is probably the easiest one in the extended cycle so far, but if you like smashing undead with a red deck, it's probably for you.\n\nThis is good to know - are there any other quests around which have a similar adventure theme style that are not in the overly difficult box. The ones i like are adventures rather than tricky puzzles to solve, my favourites include Khazad dum, Long Dark, Redhorn Gate, Watcher in the water, Spider themed ones. I am currently finding Ringmaker and Isengaard much less enjoyable than Dwarrowdelf. I want to like 3 trials but i have to rule tweak to make it work ok. I just hope to find a few more quests around that suit my adventure style. Mount Gram interested me and Rhudaur or Dread Realm but i wasnt sure if i could do them given my Ringmaker experiences."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222753-temple-of-the-deceived/?do=findComment&comment=2383986","commentId":2383986,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1472124881,"content":"My wife and I have been finding the Grey Havens + Dreamchaser cycle to be a bit easier on the whole than anything released since the Dwarrowdelf days. So far every quest has been a blast, too. I suspect that this would be a good cycle to skip to if you wanted to.\n\nEscape from Mount Gram and Across the Ettenmoors are both really fun quests from the Angmar Awakened cycle, and neither of those are too difficult. The rest of that cycle is a little on the tough side though--but the player cards from that cycle are top notch."}]}
