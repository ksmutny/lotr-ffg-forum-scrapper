When played with Sneak Attack, he is only out there for a phase as opposed to the entire turn, so Sneak Attack resolves before Gandalf's own ability does. Timing with Sneak Attack is very important because you must choose what you want to do with Gandalf, i.e. quest, attack,defend.\n\n2) I always play it that they can be exhausted immediately upon coming into play. The chart at the back of the book shows the planning phase(where you would play most allies and all attachments) as green ,meaning actions can be taken at that time. So, in my interpretation, let's say you play Steward of Gondor on a character, it's effect is an action, so you can immediately exhaust it for it's resources while still in the planning phase. If the exhausting were done as a response, it would be different because then you would have to wait on it's trigger to exhaust it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47055-rules-sneaky-gandalf-and-exhaust-the-turn-it-comes-into-play/?do=findComment&comment=471502","commentId":471502,"userName":"sWhiteboy","timestamp":1305827967,"content":"The above poster is correct."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47055-rules-sneaky-gandalf-and-exhaust-the-turn-it-comes-into-play/?do=findComment&comment=471507","commentId":471507,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1305828885,"content":"Both of the above posters are correct :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nThe following link might provide some useful examples of how some of the more complex effects of cards in the game can, or cannot, interact:\n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/66685/lord-of-the-rings-combo-compendium [http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/66685/lord-of-the-rings-combo-compendium]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47055-rules-sneaky-gandalf-and-exhaust-the-turn-it-comes-into-play/?do=findComment&comment=471620","commentId":471620,"userName":"FloLeBlanc","timestamp":1305856353,"content":"thank you all for posting"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47055-rules-sneaky-gandalf-and-exhaust-the-turn-it-comes-into-play/?do=findComment&comment=471633","commentId":471633,"userName":"Maniacske","timestamp":1305858851,"content":"Sneak attack + Gandalf seems like an insanely powerful combo cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]\n\nI wonder if there's going to be some errata on this in the future."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47055-rules-sneaky-gandalf-and-exhaust-the-turn-it-comes-into-play/?do=findComment&comment=471642","commentId":471642,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1305860469,"content":"Maniacske said:\n\n \n\nI wonder if there's going to be some errata on this in the future.\n\n\n\nI wonder if there's going to be some errata from Frodo cause with only 7 threat cost Frodo is way too good.Frodo can save you from the troll even if you have 0 cards in your hand and only your 3 heroes in play.\n\nAs for Gandalf don't forget that if he dies(it sounds like a joke but if you use him to block the troll despair's shadow effect can realy do that) you don't get him in your hand if you used sneak attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47055-rules-sneaky-gandalf-and-exhaust-the-turn-it-comes-into-play/?do=findComment&comment=471652","commentId":471652,"userName":"Shindulus","timestamp":1305861625,"content":"servant of the secret fire said:\n\n \n\nManiacske said:\n\n \n\n \n\nI wonder if there's going to be some errata on this in the future.\n\n \n\n \n\nI wonder if there's going to be some errata from Frodo cause with only 7 threat cost Frodo is way too good.Frodo can save you from the troll even if you have 0 cards in your hand and only your 3 heroes in play.\n\nAs for Gandalf don't forget that if he dies(it sounds like a joke but if you use him to block the troll despair's shadow effect can realy do that) you don't get him in your hand if you used sneak attack.\n\n \n\n \n\nAt the cost of 6 threat, strong but there is a counter part.\n\nIt's like each time you use Frodo's ability you increase his cost by the correct amount of threat.\n\nActually many heroes are strong and we can tell all are strong if played in a deck that use their abilities."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47055-rules-sneaky-gandalf-and-exhaust-the-turn-it-comes-into-play/?do=findComment&comment=471654","commentId":471654,"userName":"Vyron2","timestamp":1305861936,"content":" yeah... currently, sneak attack and stand and fight work so well with gandalf... you can actually use him up to 6 times in a game... or even 9 times if you have a leadership spirit deck... hmmm maybe one to try out? i.e. 45 threat points less, or 36 damage to any monster... + his questing/fighting ability...
