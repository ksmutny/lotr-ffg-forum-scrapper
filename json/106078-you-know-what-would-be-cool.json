The change of \"heroes were considered to enter play at the beginning of the very first turn\" is the fundamental part that everyone has then gone on to discuss.\n\nYou can't claim retroactively that you didn't say this :/\n\nAs for the idea - it depends on if they intend to double up on Silvan or \"Elven\" global boost heroes. On the other hand I think that they basically realized Dain is far too good. Dain effected heroes, allies and technically himself (if he had the ability to do something and then be ready - say UC.)\n\nBoromir or Theodred are far more likely to be the model of future global boost heroes. Boromir gives his boost to only allies, and Theodred only to heroes. Of these, I would argue that heroes is generally worse, although Theodred does help with the very specific issue of willpower in tactics I doubt that a global boost to all \"Gondor heroes\" would really be worth it - you already are incentivies to play all Gondor.\n\nCeleborn's ability is (at face value) worse. The boost is nice but only for one turn, and most allies can't benefit from all the power he provides. To really shine Celeborn players are going to need to run card draw, have a means of recycling allies in and out of play repeatedly (which is clearly the Silvan concept) and have resource acceleration or lots of super cheap allies.\n\nHe probably wouldn't be too powerful with the extra ability of giving Silvan Heroes his bonus till the end of the first turn. On the other hand he may well be approaching Dain level's of power then, and I suspect the designer's want to avoid that mistake again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1082689","commentId":1082689,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1399960956,"content":">  \n> \n> He probably wouldn't be too powerful with the extra ability of giving Silvan Heroes his bonus till the end of the first turn.

For example if we discount Dain (acknoledged as being too powerful by the design team) we can still look at how this compares with the others - although I already posted about that. Comparing to Dain will make any heroes seem weak because - well Dain is just too good.\n\nAnother question though is do we want all the global boost heroes to have the same power and feel?\n\nMany people are disappointed that Theoden boosts all tactics heroes rather than Rohan - do we eventually want every racial trait to get a hero that boosts the whole trait?\n\nCelebon's ability seems to be on par with Boromir for instance - +1 attack for all gondor allies all game for the cost of leaving 1 unspect resource - in the trait that has the best resource acceleration and manipulation. \n\nOn the other hand Celebon clearly is going to work well with characters being put into play and if Silvan gets a lot of cards that involve bouncing people back into your hand (such as born aloft style cards) such that you can trigger it repeatedly. Or if Silvan gets a lot of cheap allies and allies which fetch other silvan (guaranteeing an influx of cheap low power allies that you plan to only use for one or two turns anyway) Then his relative power within the trait will be pretty reasonable.\n\nPersonally I think (discounting Dain that's better than all the rest) that Celebon as is, is fine with the way they intend Silvan to play, and that if you added an additional boost to the first turn heroes then you would make Silvan theme too strong. I am assuming we get more allies in the form of the Silvan Refugee.\n\nIt also leaves open the possibility of later on getting a second Silvan hero that is all about boosting silvan heroes (and opening up an alternative style of play for the traits). \n\nI feel like the dwarfs, while powerful have been forever locked into a single style of play because Dain is all about loads of allies - and then all the dwarf heroes from the hobbit saga are also all about the allies - and really I don't think you could feasibly play dwarfs any other way. (Despite the fact you could easily have tried to build a dwarven attachments style theme as well).\n\n \n\nSo I think it would be less good for the game to put all the power on Celeborn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1083242","commentId":1083242,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1399998091,"content":"> No, it would.\n\n \n\nWhat do you think is cool?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1083271","commentId":1083271,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1399999041,"content":">  \n> \n> > No, it would.\n> \n>  \n> \n> What do you think is cool?\n> \n>  \n\nСeleborn that worked on heroes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1083275","commentId":1083275,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1399999269,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > No, it would.\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > What do you think is cool?\n> > \n> >  \n> \n> Сeleborn that worked on heroes.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nThis is going to become circular rather quickly - what else do you think is cool?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1083778","commentId":1083778,"userName":"ZanzibarLand","timestamp":1400031431,"content":"This thread has descended into utter chaos.\n\nPs, I like stuff and things."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1083881","commentId":1083881,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1400040087,"content":"> > > You imply that Dain´s ability is the same but he does not give +1 defense and his ability \"only\" works when he is ready.\n> > > \n> > > The argument that there are not that many silvan heroes right now isn´t really valid seeing as more heroes will be added at some point.\n> > \n> > It'll be rare to get enough readying abilities on the board in round 1 to actually make use of more than 1 stat point per hero, and I really don't think giving each hero +1 of a stat for a single round would be game-breaking at all.

I still don't think it'd be too powerful to have the 1-turn boost, but that seems to be a matter of opinion. It'd still be an interesting/cool effect, which what Tue whole point of this thread is. I think we may have over-stayed our welcome on this topic, so I'm just gonna he done now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1083892","commentId":1083892,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1400041263,"content":"Any time trololo makes a thread it always turns into this.  Some of you guys care way too much about what the others think; It doesn't matter....it's someone you don't know.....  Ridiculous....... "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1083898","commentId":1083898,"userName":"Sinamil2","timestamp":1400041443,"content":"Long shot I know, but I'm hoping we see out first 0 cost ally in the Silvan family, it would fit perfectly, especially if they can easily ping pong back to your hand somehow."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1083899","commentId":1083899,"userName":"Sinamil2","timestamp":1400041467,"content":"And no I don't count Bill the Pony, printed 0 :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1083915","commentId":1083915,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1400042574,"content":"> Long shot I know, but I'm hoping we see out first 0 cost ally in the Silvan family, it would fit perfectly, especially if they can easily ping pong back to your hand somehow.\n\n \n\nIt would fit perfectly - but what sort of card are you expecting it to be?\n\n \n\nAn errand rider without an action?

Having an extra person to take hits in the combat step is always useful. (You'd need to look at 0 cost events for comparable power - and all of them involve paying in another way except stand together). \n\nSo realistically to get a 0 cost ally you're going to need an ally that exhausts another ally as it comes into play (that being part of the cost) and it would have to also have poor stats.\n\nIt also needs to be worse than 2/0/0/1 Forced: if a character leaves play discard [this card] from play. Since Silvan refugee is cost 1.\n\nHowever something like:\n\n \n\n[This card]\n\nCost 0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n \n\nSIlvan\n\n \n\nForced: When [this card] is put into play, exhaust one character you control.\n\nNow normally this would be pretty poor (you're wasting the turn of of your allies or heroes that will almost certainly be better used with it's own stats) It would have limited use outside of Celeborn, but with him it's pretty good. (Similar themed cards could chain together round after round).\n\nAnother option would be something similar with the rule changed to:\n\nForced: After [this card] exhausts , at the end of the phase remove it from play. This would effectively be 0 cost for a 1 time defence or 1 willpower (better with Celeborn, and it works two times with Galadriel). This is similar to Escort from Edoras (Which is cost 2 for 4 willpower or 1 defence).\n\nBoth versions would be cheap ways to pay for certain card effects though, so it may be that it's still not feasible to reduce an ally to cost 0, for other balance reasons that aren't immediately occurring to me. They open up some potentially interesting things though - both versions would make horn of Gondor actually make resources (instead of really being an offset to the cost of allies as it is now).\n\nI like your idea of making them neutral. They could be called Traveler to Valinor (neutral because they're losing their ties to the world of men). I think the second version is more likely as Edoras sets a precedent for it although both may be okay."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106078-you-know-what-would-be-cool/?do=findComment&comment=1084181","commentId":1084181,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1400066073,"content":"Just make a 0 cost ally with stats 0,0,0,1 and give it no ability.
