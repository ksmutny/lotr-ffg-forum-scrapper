And thanks for excellent support for previous noob questions.\n\n \n\nSo, I understand that if my progress tokens received from matching Will against Threat complete the current location card can carry over to go on to the current quest card.\n\n \n\nHowever, if I complete a quest card, does the same rule apply. That being, that I can carry over progress tokens to the next quest card from the previous quest card.\n\n \n\nMany thanks in advance,\n\n \n\nJJ"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111350-carrying-over-progress-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1163641","commentId":1163641,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1405935856,"content":"No carryover to the next questcard since all progress gained through normal means must be placed at the same time.\n\nIf however you have both Legolas and Blade of Gondolin, you can decide you (after you kill an enemy of course) the order in which you resolve those effects: only need 1 progress on current quest? Then activate BoG and carry out all quest-related progression, after which you can activate Legolas´ ability.\n\nThe reason it works this way is because quest-progression is a passive ability which triggers (and interrupts the normal flow of the game) the moment it´s conditions are met. However because progress from questing is normally placed all at the same time (as opposed to 1 token at a time) there is no carryover."}]}
