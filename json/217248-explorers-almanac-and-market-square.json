The attachment itself, doesn't place any progress.  It just provides the avenue.  Is it because the passive effect (choice) on Explorer's Almanac can technically, only be utilized by the player who controls it?\n\n \n\nQuesting successfully is what causes the placement of progress and at that point, any player can place the progress.\n\n \n\nPerhaps no one has to raise his threat because the questing successfully progress placement isn't a \"player\", but a built in framework effect.\n\n \n\nI think that it is probably #2 or #5.  Both make sense to me.\n\nEdited April 13, 2016 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217248-explorers-almanac-and-market-square/?do=findComment&comment=2168094","commentId":2168094,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1460575170,"content":"I'd argue on the fact that even though it is a passive effect, it is still optional and as the controller of the attachment, only that person can choose to enable the effect.  So you are choosing to put progress on that location or you are choosing not to.  Either way, it is your choice through your own card effect, so that is why I'd say it has to be the controller.   "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217248-explorers-almanac-and-market-square/?do=findComment&comment=2168275","commentId":2168275,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1460581231,"content":"I'd vote for other: everyone raises their threat.  I'd think that if you place progress after questing successfully, that is a function of all players as a group, rather than one specific player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217248-explorers-almanac-and-market-square/?do=findComment&comment=2169631","commentId":2169631,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1460650534,"content":"Are you going to send in the question?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217248-explorers-almanac-and-market-square/?do=findComment&comment=2169739","commentId":2169739,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1460654011,"content":"> Are you going to send in the question?\n\n \n\nI can, but can't right now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217248-explorers-almanac-and-market-square/?do=findComment&comment=2213909","commentId":2213909,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1463062612,"content":"Any news?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217248-explorers-almanac-and-market-square/?do=findComment&comment=2213921","commentId":2213921,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1463062925,"content":"Nope!

So in essence, the game is placing that progress on the location and no one raises their threat from Market Square.\n> \n> Hope you’re enjoying Murder at the Prancing Pony!\n> \n> Cheers,\n> \n> Caleb\n\n \n\nAwesome! I was so hoping this was the ruling!  I really like Explorer's Almanac.\n\nEdited May 13, 2016 by cmabr002"}]}
