Before it went down, I had issues with the speed of lotrlcg.com, as well as with the fact that their entire URL scheme changed recently, which caused all of the links on my blog to break. As a bear, and developer of magical software, I decided to scratch this particular itch and fix the problem myself. I own the hallofbeorn.com domain and the site is hosted on Amazon EC2, so there should be little problem with downtime. Also, I make this pledge right now to NEVER change the URL scheme of this site. This means that http://50.19.233.173/Cards/Details/51223bd0-ffd1-11df-a976-0801200c9001 [http://50.19.233.173/Cards/Details/51223bd0-ffd1-11df-a976-0801200c9001]\n\n \n\nwill always point to Core Set Aragorn. In any case, I haven't added The Morgul Vale yet, and there are still some cards with missing text and/or flavor text, but this is a good start.

Where do you load the card data from initially / how do you load new sets into memory?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94330-a-replacement-to-lotrlcgcom/?do=findComment&comment=922254","commentId":922254,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1386107447,"content":"Hey CaffeineAddict, because of the complexity of the metadata around cards, I am actually storing them as instances of a Card class (i.e. in code).\n\n \n\nI processed through the XML that is available from OCTGN to grab all of the metadata (I had to clean it up a bit, but without that this would have taken forever). Then I wrote a translator to turn that metadata into code. The repository of all available sets is just an in-memory array of Card instances that is searched and sorted directly. This makes the site very fast, it also gives me the ability to add any kind of search feature I want, in code. Even searches that might be really difficult to write in a set-based language like SQL are trivial against an in-memory store. The only reason this works (on a micro-instance of AWS no less) is because the overall size of the card pool is still relatively small (a little over a thousand cards). If the card set consisted of millions of cards, a traditional relational database would be the only way to go. As it is, if I want to add the ability for saving decks, or other user-generated features (comments, ratings, etc.) I will need to go that route. For now, everything is read only and gets cached when the web server starts.\n\nEdited December 3, 2013 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94330-a-replacement-to-lotrlcgcom/?do=findComment&comment=922317","commentId":922317,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1386113236,"content":"Thanks for the suggestion, Scroll Lock.
