Denethor's ability is decent, but if you need him to block you won't get to use it much. You should also have Henamarth in play to make it more effective, and it makes little difference in 3-4-player games. I don't think Gildor's Counsel is worth the cost.

You buy off your facing encounter card, while you can still help the group with your heroes. I think it's worth to spend 3 resources you get in a round to reduce the encounter card's to a game with 1 player less. Because I play in secrecy I sometimes get to some resourcefuls which make me initially richer over a single round. But next to that I don't pay those 3 resources that often.

There is no doubt that at this point our player, nicknamed Drizzt Do Urden, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and went back to CCGs and booster packs.

The Hobbit was read several times, and Caleb himself showed up and converted all existing heroes to their Leadership versions.\n\n \n\nThe spirit nerd lost his deck and sold his cards the next day.
