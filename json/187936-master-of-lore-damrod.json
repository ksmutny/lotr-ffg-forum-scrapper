Here are some distinct examples:\n>  \n> 1) I discard 4 cards to lower the cost of Gildor Inglorion using To the Sea, then trigger Grima to reduce his cost to 0.\n> 2) Exhaust Master of Lore and name \"Event\", reducing the cost of Out of the Wild by 1, then if I am in Secrecy it becomes cost 0.\n> 3) Exhaust Master of Lore and name \"Attachment\", then playing Ranger Spikes for free with Damrod.\n> 4) Exhaust Master of Lore and name \"Attachment\", reducing the cost of Scroll of Isildur by 1. Then, If I have 3 Lore heroes, it becomes free.\n\n \n\n \n\n> You can choose the order in which you resolve effects, so you can reduce a card’s cost to a minimum of 1 with one effect and then reduce it down to 0 with another effect. Each of your examples look to be correct in that regard.\n> \n> Cheers,\n> Caleb\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187936-master-of-lore-damrod/?do=findComment&comment=2047311","commentId":2047311,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1455223441,"content":"Like you said earlier though, Damrod is a passive, not an effect you are choosing.  So Caleb's response doesn't necessarily apply to that scenario since Damrod is in effect first, followed by MoL's triggered effect.\n\nEdited February 11, 2016 by Slothgodfather"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187936-master-of-lore-damrod/?do=findComment&comment=2047322","commentId":2047322,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1455223673,"content":"> Like you said earlier though, Damrod is a passive, not an effect you are choosing.  So Caleb's response doesn't necessarily apply to that scenario since Damrod is in effect first, followed by MoL's triggered effect.\n\n \n\nLook at example 3."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187936-master-of-lore-damrod/?do=findComment&comment=2047454","commentId":2047454,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1455227769,"content":"I was thinking of MoL more of a triggered effect that has to be applied after Damrod's passive, but essentially (after triggering MoL) we are getting two passive reduction effects that will affect the cost of the card - and you can pick the order in which the passive effects resolve because they conflict.  (min 1, min 0)\n\n \n\n \n\nJust curious since it was brought up earlier - how does MoL effect Daeron's Runes then?\n\nEdited February 11, 2016 by Slothgodfather"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187936-master-of-lore-damrod/?do=findComment&comment=2050672","commentId":2050672,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1455396395,"content":"Yeah!
