He is a repeatable Radagast's Cunning. You just have to build your deck around threat-lowering options, which makes sense for hobbits anyway.\n\nExcept Radagasts cunning doesn't require you to raise your threat, can be used more than once a turn, and doesn't make u exhaust a hero. (Although ur right it can be used on multiple turns)\n\nI guess my hang up with Fatty is that I dont see the net gain of his ability as substantial. Your negating the threat cost of an enemy whom if they did count, you would what? Quest negatively and increase your threat any anyway? It is good if you are getting land locked and really need to clear a location or on that last stage of the quest and need just a few more points of progress, but I feel as tho those occasions are few and far between. The ability would have been nicer if it were response and not requiring to exhaust him although this can be easily mitigated with throwing a fast hitch on him.\n\nIf I'm also running lore I think I'd rather just use ithilien tracker. Much better\n\nin multiplayer if someone is pulling off the wandering took/song of erandil combo, he may be of more use\n\nI guess I was just expecting something better after the reveal of Sam, Merry, and Pippin.

Of course Merry wouldn't get to do much but questing, but starting at 23 threat, having 6 willpower questing right away and Dúnhere hoping for the Daggers, it seems nice. Plus you have the easy access to the Pipe and Smoke Rings (not to mention GalaGreet).

Hide 2) will only effect the player who is currently revealing the encounter card (written as \"you\" on the cards). When a hide card is revealed a player action window is opened and the active player can exhaust and commit any number of characters (including zero) to the hide test. X cards are discarded from the top of the encounter deck and all of the threat values of those cards are added up. If the total threat of discarded cards exceeds the total willpower of all characters committed to the hide test, then the hide test is failed. Otherwise the player has successfully remained hidden. Failing will cause all Nazgul in the staging area to immediately engage the active player (the one who failed the hide test).

It's hard to judge how helpful it might be before playing a Hobbit deck first. I could imagine though that these decks allow you to lower your threat beyond 10 points.

However, in solo mode it still seems to be bit of a waste, but then we already have Fast Hitch to increase the Hobbit's flexibility.\n\n \n\nWhen playing multiplayer his ability is ability makes more sense.
