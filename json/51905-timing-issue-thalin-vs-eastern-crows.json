Reveal all 4, both crows shuffled back into new encounter pile.\n\n \n\nany thoughts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51905-timing-issue-thalin-vs-eastern-crows/?do=findComment&comment=517749","commentId":517749,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1313925220,"content":" Option 1 is correct.  It is possible, although unlikely, that you could trap the game in a loop in this way - if you have no enemies in play, then none will get shadow cards, and you'll never cycle through the deck. Sort of a cheezy way to get through the game, but c'est la vie.\n\n \n\n(if it really bothers you, just don't quest with Thalin for 1 turn.)"}]}
