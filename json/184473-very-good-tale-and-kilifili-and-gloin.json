If i use a Very Good Tale and put into play Kili or Fili, I CAN'T fetch the other card (kili or fili) because you have to play Kili or Fili from your hand? Same question for ally Gloin, I would NOT get the resource if i use A Very Good Tale to get Gloin out??\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184473-very-good-tale-and-kilifili-and-gloin/?do=findComment&comment=1725418","commentId":1725418,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1438967779,"content":"Correct.
