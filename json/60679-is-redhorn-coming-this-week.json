I know people that have only played some quest like 2 times or something.. in some cases not even once. I know I personally have hardly even scratched the surface of Kaz. I haven't even had time to try the last quest and have only just got near 100% win ratio decks on the 1st 2.. and then I am only using \"simple\" decks.. I still belive I have barly scratched the surface of 1 single combo (ziggy) let alone experimented with some of the other things possible in lhaz... I think that while I enjoy this game it is easy to get caught up in FFGs release schedule that is designed to milk as much money as possible and forget that just cause it exists dose not mmean you need to buy it instantly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60679-is-redhorn-coming-this-week/?do=findComment&comment=596498","commentId":596498,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1329746016,"content":"Seeing as I still have eight games left of 7th Level, then 10 of Flight from Moria (and probably 10 of Osgiliath), not in a hurry myself.\n\nOT, but first impressions of 7th Level make me think whoever listed it as difficulty 3 was smoking the same stuff the person rating Carrock a 7 was. Seriously, didn't have a single progress token on 1B at the end of the game! Started with 9 threat in the staging area, Goblin Scout, Orc Horn Blower (surge + When Revealed, thank you very much), Goblin Spearman, Goblin Tunnels, with heroes barely putting out 10 willpower for the first turn thanks to Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn. Managed to Forest Snare both Cave Trolls, but got mauled by having to always defend against the KD orcs who autokill you with undefended attacks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60679-is-redhorn-coming-this-week/?do=findComment&comment=596551","commentId":596551,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1329752410,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nspalanzani said:\n\n \n\nIn answer to the subject of this thread: \"OH PLEASE GOD, I HOPE SO!\"\n\nAhem.
