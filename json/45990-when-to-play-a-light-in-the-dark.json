I expect you'd take damage."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45990-when-to-play-a-light-in-the-dark/?do=findComment&comment=461085","commentId":461085,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1304085885,"content":"The safest bet is to use it right after engagement checks are made and before dealing the shadow card.

Once you pass that point the Enemy is attacking and he have to deal with it. \n\nIn multiplayer the card the better because you can use it to change who a Enemy is engaged with because another player can engage it next turn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45990-when-to-play-a-light-in-the-dark/?do=findComment&comment=461096","commentId":461096,"userName":"Entropy42","timestamp":1304086959,"content":"Yeah, thanks.  I think I should have chosen a different title, as I was really just wanting to know if I could avoid combat damage by playing it after the Shadow card is revealed.  This came up in my last game, as I had an attack that was going to kill the defender, on account of a bad Shadow card being revealed, and I was wondering if it was legal to save it with A Light in the Dark.  Seems the consensus is no."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45990-when-to-play-a-light-in-the-dark/?do=findComment&comment=461121","commentId":461121,"userName":"Apophenia","timestamp":1304089756,"content":"Canceling Shadow effects what Hasty Stoke is for, yet another reason I like Spirit decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45990-when-to-play-a-light-in-the-dark/?do=findComment&comment=461281","commentId":461281,"userName":"Kitsune Rei","timestamp":1304129719,"content":"I agree, the game is rather non-interrupt from what I have seen (ie not always reactionary like Magic), so you'd have to pre-empt the shadow card in the first place or things are already in motion and cannot be interrupted until another pause in phases. You have to kind of gamble a bit how to play best since you don't know for sure how things will turn out. Like you have to pre-emptively think how to use healing."}]}
