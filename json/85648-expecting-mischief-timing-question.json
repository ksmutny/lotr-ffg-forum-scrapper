Expecting Mischief, however is simply worded \"first enemy revealed\". \n \nNormally I would say that this would clearly mean that keywords and enemy \"when revealed\" effects would trigger first as the action window for you to play an event is AFTER encounter cards are revealed. BUT in the case of Expecting Mischief, the card is already played and is engaging in its effect even before encounter staging.\n \nSo…yeah. No idea. Honestly though if it DOESN'T trigger first the card is a bit crap (yeah, yeah--Denathor and Henamarth (sp?), but that is limiting utility).\n \nAnyway--any other ideas? I may just have to email FF."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85648-expecting-mischief-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=807727","commentId":807727,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1372861578,"content":"UPDATE!\n\nI contacted FF and Caleb dropped me a line to clear things up.\n\nOfficial word is that as the effect comes into play BEFORE any encounter card is revealed it triggers before keywords and \"when revealed\" effects. If the enemy is destroyed, those effects never trigger.\n\nGreat, great news for this card. Now an auto-include for me in all 3 or 4 player games where I have any lore.\n\nNow that I think about it though, I have another question--this time about its interaction w/ Thalin. As they are simultaneous effects could the first player chose to NOT trigger Expecting Mischief against a 1hp enemy by triggering Thalin's effect first an killing it? Would that allow Expecting Mischief to trigger on the next enemy revealed or would it simply not trigger?\n\nHmmmm..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85648-expecting-mischief-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=807729","commentId":807729,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1372861815,"content":"nice!\n\nas to the 2nd, i would say no.....if it was a response you could chose, but it isnt. i would say it just all goes to the first enemy\n\nperhaps i am wrong so i would see what others think first\n\ni asked a similar question recently\n\n\"....when i reveal a 2 health enemy, and have expecting mischeif and ranger spikes in staging....what happens? am i correct in thinking that the 2 damage kills it before it 'hits' the staging area, meaning the spikes arent attatched so are eligble for the next enemy?\n\nthe spikes says 'enters the staging area' but i dont think they do if they die\"\n\n \n\nrich\n\nEdited July 3, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85648-expecting-mischief-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=807807","commentId":807807,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1372869747,"content":"> nice!as to the 2nd, i would say no.....if it was a response you could chose, but it isnt. i would say it just all goes to the first enemyperhaps i am wrong so i would see what others think firsti asked a similar question recently\"....when i reveal a 2 health enemy, and have expecting mischeif and ranger spikes in staging....what happens? am i correct in thinking that the 2 damage kills it before it 'hits' the staging area, meaning the spikes arent attatched so are eligble for the next enemy?the spikes says 'enters the staging area' but i dont think they do if they die\" rich\n\nYeah--kind of think it won't fly. But then again if Thalin's ability triggers \"as\" it's revealed and resolves then it may never be revealed to be a target for Expectig Mischief.

Thereby the first player choosing which happens first? So technically you could have the expecting mischief kill a 2 hp or lower enemy and then still have the spikes remain in the staging area and attach to the following enemy? Or in the case of more than two hp's the enemy would be damaged as well as stuck in the spikes?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85648-expecting-mischief-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=828973","commentId":828973,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1375390729,"content":"i would say no, as mischief triggers 'when revealed' but spikes is when it hits staging area. i seem to remember the new FAQ having something about spikes\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85648-expecting-mischief-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=829024","commentId":829024,"userName":"cyberlettuce","timestamp":1375393136,"content":"Right I see the difference, that makes sense rich"}]}
