They're still noticeably different than regular cards though. Always kinda sucks when you can look at the encounter deck and know the next card is going to be one of the nightmare inclusions, but I suppose you could solve that by dealing from the bottom of the deck or something. I second that they should make them for all the scenarios, they really do make you want to replay them! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100270-nightmare-cards/?do=findComment&comment=999050","commentId":999050,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1393620677,"content":"You can solve it by not looking at the encounter deck until you need to deal cards from it.
