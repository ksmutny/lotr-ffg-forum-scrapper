Yet whenever \"evolution\" and \"progress\" are used to create \"better\" stories, the results are groan worthy and ultimately forgetable. If you want a feminist fantasy world then go create one, but that's not what feminism is about. It's about going back and \"fixing\" what isn't broken and making everyone who likes it as is feel guilty, ashamed, and obsolete. That's why they are bullies.\n\nThe reason I am personally a traced to women is because they are so vastly different from me. If gender is just some liquid changeable thing then I have no interest in romance or marriage (which is why feminism destroys the concept of family). I want women in stories who are feminine and I don't want to apologize for the masculinity of the male characters. The lack of female characters in Tolkien is not sexism. It is a story about violent conflict and in that context the stories are better with a group of men (band of brothers). I am not interested in evolving beyond that, evolving beyond the honour of what that means. When women are made violent in equal measure in denigrate both genders. Nothing illustrates that more than LOTR.\n\nI will refrain from further comment to prevent the thread from spiraling out of control.

There is nothing that would stop her marrying some other high ranking offical at court.\n\nShe is a desirable elf after all. \n\n \n\nNow if, say her mother had an accident, something, that made her disfigured, even bearded... that would instantly make her a socially ugly elf and yet someone dwarves could relate to.\n\nI hope there is no need to go deep about social constructivism  of beauty ideals here. \n\n \n\nSo now to Kili, he is adventurous, youngest, eager to see the world, probably love thirsty, and into her life comes this exotic beauty (a hairy elf), i can see why he fall in love. \n\n \n\nAnd the tension is still the same. Both societies stil look disagreeably upon this kind of love. And also Tauriel and Kili is full of doubt. \n\n \n\nLegolas, he is an interesting one. But again not the typical elf. He might have discovered the inner beauty of Tauriel, under the layers of disfigurement. He is in conflict with himself, the elven society. \n\n \n\nSo many complex characters and stories rise. \n\n \n\nAnd Tauriel in the film? Too simple.

Characters in Tolkien's opus exist for specific reasons, and are tiles of a perfect mosaic. There are reasons why Elves and Dwarves are not friend anymore (goodbye, Beleriand, sacking Menegroth at the end of the First Age had some little consequences) and in general there's a feeling of mistrust and prejudice (see the first scenes with Gimli at Imladris, or Gimli entering Lorien). Often Tolkien stresses how Legolas and Gimli changed this for the very first time, to the point that Gimli seems to have been accepted in the now precluded West.\n\n \n\nI have nothing against Tauriel per se, as I don't have anything against other female characters that may (or may not) have specific roles into adaptations from books (even tho I must say that there are few women characters in Tolkien's writings, but man, they are so good! From Morwen to Galadriel to Erendis to Eowyn, they are everything but without temper!), but I have a lot of things against the \"let's put a love story here so that people will speak about it for eternity because we know we're doing something that will upset many, and talking about something is the best way to make promotion\", and even more against the \"let's take a short book and create a 3-part movie that will make us earn millions of dollars. Wait, not enough material? Let's invent half of the story, people will buy it nonetheless\". For me this is a lack of respect towards the author's intentions. If you want to make a movie based on The Hobbit, then, please, do The Hobbit. Adapt what you need, modernize the language, whatevs, but do not create an overbloated blob and pretend it's Tolkien.\n\n \n\nJust my two cents, and only my opinion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184501-tauriel/?do=findComment&comment=1726834","commentId":1726834,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1439049485,"content":"I just wanted to drop this here, especially for those who haven't read the Silmarillion..
