And even the 1st is sold out - more are ordered, but they got none from that FFG retailer. (Since about half a year or something like that!)\n\nSo I do wonder if anyone can recommend me an store which has the english version of all the 6 APs in stock (for a reasonable price) and ships (also for a reasonable price) to Germany?!?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312366-where-to-buy-germany-but-english-cards/?do=findComment&comment=4011045","commentId":4011045,"userName":"mttrchrds","timestamp":1604625304,"content":"I posted this some time ago.

Some pages are closed, some shops do not list that AP and all the others list that as out of stock. I didn't try the other APs.\n\nEdited November 6 by DatNerd"}]}
