On the card its says:-\n\n \n\nForced: When Orc Rabble is dealt a shadow card, it gets +2 Attack until the end of the phase.\n\n \n\nThere are several cards which deal extra shadow cards, am I right in saying Orc Rabble gets +2 attack for every shadow dealt to it? Or is it just the first one? I have been assuming its every card, which at one unlucky stage resulted in Orc Rabble having +12 Attack!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90825-orc-rabble/?do=findComment&comment=872493","commentId":872493,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1379839825,"content":"You are correct that it gets +2 Attack for each shadow card dealt to it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90825-orc-rabble/?do=findComment&comment=872532","commentId":872532,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1379851723,"content":"yes- i had almost all of those types of shadow cards in 1 go. it ended up with around 9 shadow cards!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90825-orc-rabble/?do=findComment&comment=872626","commentId":872626,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1379866453,"content":"Yeah, this is an evil card and all by itself is a good justification to include shadow cancellation in your deck for quests where it shows up.

I'm really bored. Anyway, back on topic, does anyone else find the Orc Ravager from Nightmare Cair Andros even more annoying? With the Rabble, you can just defend with a chump blocker, but the Ravager can stick around indefinitely swinging for 3. Enemies can really pile up in that quest.\n\nEdited August 11, 2015 by Ecthelion III"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90825-orc-rabble/?do=findComment&comment=1733287","commentId":1733287,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1439408560,"content":"yah its because of the shadow cards that to this day, I have never beat this quest with more than 2 players. I mean, when there are 3 or more attacks being made every turn, the chances are astronomical that you will loose a hero in the first 2 turns."}]}
