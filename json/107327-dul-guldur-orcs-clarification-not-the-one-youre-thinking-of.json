Deal 2 damage to that character.\" \n\n \n\nDoes this mean any character, including any other players that might also be questing, or must it be a character the first player controls.  Typically the game clarifies with \"you control\" but in this case, I wanted to check.  \n\n \n\nI'm sorry, It's a really dumb opening question for my first post on the forums :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n-Pearls\n\n \n\nEDIT:  I can't even spell Dol Guldur.   \n\nEdited May 28, 2014 by Pearls"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107327-dul-guldur-orcs-clarification-not-the-one-youre-thinking-of/?do=findComment&comment=1099987","commentId":1099987,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1401242076,"content":"I always played it as if it could be any character--- SO, sometimes the first player has 0 questing characters, but he still has to choose someone who belongs to another player.  Same for Black Uruks [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Black-Uruks-KD] from the Khazad-dum expansion. \n\n \n\nI don't have an official source to point to, I am just playing it to the letter of the card.  As you said: it doesn't specify \"you control,\" so any character should be a possible target."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107327-dul-guldur-orcs-clarification-not-the-one-youre-thinking-of/?do=findComment&comment=1103096","commentId":1103096,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1401461408,"content":"I've always interpreted it as any character belonging to any player as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107327-dul-guldur-orcs-clarification-not-the-one-youre-thinking-of/?do=findComment&comment=1103175","commentId":1103175,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1401464437,"content":"That is my interpretation also..\n\n \n\nAny (regardless the player controlling him) character questing can be chosen to take the damage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107327-dul-guldur-orcs-clarification-not-the-one-youre-thinking-of/?do=findComment&comment=1133031","commentId":1133031,"userName":"Aragorn son of Will","timestamp":1403719669,"content":"I've never interprated it like that but, yeah that makes more sense"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107327-dul-guldur-orcs-clarification-not-the-one-youre-thinking-of/?do=findComment&comment=1133824","commentId":1133824,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1403765357,"content":"Welcome to the forums!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107327-dul-guldur-orcs-clarification-not-the-one-youre-thinking-of/?do=findComment&comment=1133836","commentId":1133836,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1403766848,"content":"Not a dumb question at all!
