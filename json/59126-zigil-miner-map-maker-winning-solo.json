For instance, we've already seen a previewed enemy from the upcoming cycle (in The Road to Rivendell, I think) that has the ambush keyword and discards attachments when it engages a player. That could potentially make life very difficult for decks based around Steward of Gondor. As for Zigil Miner, it is an undoubtedly powerful card. That being said, it is an ally with one health that must exhaust to use its ability. There are plenty of cards (mostly treacheries, but also shadow effects like that on Hummerhorns and enemies like Mirkwood Bats) that simply kill it outright. It's very, very good, but also pretty fragile. \n\nMy point, I guess, is that we're starting to see encounter card effects that seem designed to limit or neutralize some of the more powerful cards in the current environment. I wouldn't be surprised to see a location/enemy/treachery that really mucks with the Zigil Miner combo."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59126-zigil-miner-map-maker-winning-solo/?do=findComment&comment=581144","commentId":581144,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1326870407,"content":"i like these ideas. its as if FFG is playing with us by releasing it early, allowing us to use it and get used to it, then release some crazy treachery cards that put it down a huge step or two- to me this is good- it shows a good relationship between designer and player, meaning we constantly have to re-think our playing strategy- keeping the game ever fresh"}]}
