I'm quite happy with them being upgrade cards that only work with one specific deck (for the same reason that I'm quite happy to have decks that are generic and decks which are scenario specific).\n\n \n\nMy only concern is that they intend to make them PoD expansions - which means they'll be obviously different from the other cards, however if they work as a seperate deck (the nightmare deck, draw 1 a turn - or something to that effect) that would be okay. Alternatively they could be replace the encounter deck with teh nightmare deck (which with only 20 or so cards, would be a highly themed and constructed deck in all probability).\n\n \n\nI would like to know, more about the competitive play (is it comparing scores for different players/teams), and also if they card quality of the game night kits is better than PoD quality or the same."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75440-game-night-kits/?do=findComment&comment=732825","commentId":732825,"userName":"Migwald","timestamp":1355237207,"content":"Escape From Dol Guldur is already a nightmare!\n\nI find the Core quests and Mirkwood adventures the right level for me using cards from these sets.

It increases the number of prisonners to 2 for 3 palyers and 3 for 4 players (had to do a little zooming :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ), but not for 1 or 2 players.\n\nSo the increase for solo-duo game will be marginal in comparison to 3 or 4 players. The quest was fairly easy for 2-3-4 competitive constructed decks already, with very few cards scaling with the number of players. So it looks fine to me for now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75440-game-night-kits/?do=findComment&comment=732926","commentId":732926,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1355246772,"content":"I'd like to add that Nightmare mode (being used on old quests) is a great idea to increase the game's longlevity - it means they can address power creep by allowing the old decks to gain creep as well as the new ones.\n\nThat means more cards, and card variety for both the forces of Shadow, and the player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75440-game-night-kits/?do=findComment&comment=732938","commentId":732938,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1355247823,"content":"I'm really excited about spreading the word about LOTR:LCG to my game store.
