If LOTR was competitive, it would probably be one of the top games, assuming it had good mechanics of course. Netrunner is the top of competitive heap because it does have interesting mechanics and design. Tolkien's works are among the most read works in existence, so I highly doubt it has anything to do with the source material, and has more to do with cooperative model."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102209-netrunner-vs-lotr/?do=findComment&comment=1025873","commentId":1025873,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1395730435,"content":">  Tolkien's works are among the most read works in existence, so I highly doubt it has anything to do with the source material, and has more to do with cooperative model.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nTolkiens books have also been around for quite a longer time than \"dystopian future\" stories.\n\n \n\nAlso, and I might be wrong in this, I believe that people who are fans of the grim-future genre tend to get their inspiration and reading done from many different kinds of sources. While that may also be true for fantasy to a certain degree, I think that fans of fantasy will reach a point where Lord of the Rings will be a must-read book; on that simple premise of it´s status as grandfather of all fantasy.\n\nWhich will lead to more people having read LotR than any one specific \"dark future\" book.\n\n \n\nEDIT to answer OP (sort of): feel like the comparison between LotR and Netrunner LCGs are like trying to compare the taste of pork to that of chicken and deciding which is the better option.\n\nEdited March 25, 2014 by Nerdmeister"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102209-netrunner-vs-lotr/?do=findComment&comment=1025938","commentId":1025938,"userName":"HeavyKaragh","timestamp":1395736973,"content":"There's a measure of success of competitive games: tournament number and size.

There are people playing in stores, you can see tournament announcements on the stores and reports on the web. Also, there's always a lot more discussion around the cards and strategies than in cooperative games.\n\n \n\nAnyway, I think LotR's health is good, because they continue printing a lot of stuff, including Print on Demand."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102209-netrunner-vs-lotr/?do=findComment&comment=1025985","commentId":1025985,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1395742887,"content":"lotr lcg is really unique game. is take own place on market. but im really doubt there will be another coop lcg from ffg. but lotr fir sure will live long time as a game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102209-netrunner-vs-lotr/?do=findComment&comment=1026000","commentId":1026000,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1395744849,"content":"> lotr lcg is really unique game. is take own place on market. but im really doubt there will be another coop lcg from ffg. but lotr fir sure will live long time as a game.\n\nThough Star Wars lcg already has a coop/multiplayer version so I doubt your doubts :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102209-netrunner-vs-lotr/?do=findComment&comment=1026008","commentId":1026008,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1395745824,"content":"Put me in the 'competitive is more popular' camp.
