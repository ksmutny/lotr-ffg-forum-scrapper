If it is \npossible to observe both card text and the text of the \nrulebook, both are observed.\nExample: The rulebook (p. 15) reads: “Any progress \ntokens that would be placed on a quest card are instead \nplaced on the active location.” Legolas (CORE 5) has \nan effect that reads, “...place 2 progress tokens on the \ncurrent quest.” Legolas’ effect would place 2 progress \ntokens on the quest; the core rule from page 15 instead \nplaces those tokens on the active location. Thus, the \nLegolas ability can successfully resolve, and the core \nrule can be observed, without creating a golden rule \nsituation. \n \nQ: Does the effect on Legolas (CORE 5) place progress \ntokens on an active location, if there is one? \nA: Yes. Always place progress tokens on an active \nlocation instead of the quest, unless the ability \nspecifically states to bypass any active location.\n \nSo what is rigth answer can legolas place progress tokens on active location or not?\nEdited March 31, 2014 by Dwarf king Bronze beard"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102823-legolas/?do=findComment&comment=1033602","commentId":1033602,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1396293264,"content":"Yes he does."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102823-legolas/?do=findComment&comment=1033614","commentId":1033614,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1396293597,"content":"Hmmmm, as a follow up question now that I think of it:\n\nIf the location says \"immune to player card effects\" do they go on the quest instead?\n\nMy guess is no, and they are lost...but does anyone know for certain?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102823-legolas/?do=findComment&comment=1033782","commentId":1033782,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1396299678,"content":"Yes, Legolas's effect places progress tokens on the active location before the current quest.  If that location is \"Immune to card effects\" the progress tokens are simply lost."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102823-legolas/?do=findComment&comment=1034017","commentId":1034017,"userName":"tacomen253","timestamp":1396311574,"content":"Pretty good question.
