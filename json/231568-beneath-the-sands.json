About time we get an ally that can cancel when revealed effects (albeit only on enemies)!\n\nHe has nice stats for his low cost of 2 as well which is always nice. Won't be too painful discarding him to use his ability as he has low stats but at the same time he will still serve a purpose until his ability is needed even with his low cost. \n\n \n\nThe rohan ally is potentially even better. 2/2/0/2 for 3 is pretty good to begin with. The ability is fantastic (so long as you are running side quests) and allows you to utilize both the 2 attack and 2 willpower.  Its also another scout character so works with Scouting Party. Finally it doesn't even say player side quest so this is a great ally for Lost Realm and Angmar Awakened and any other quests that feature side quests. \n\nNot as crazy about the neutral event... 9 traits is actually quite a lot.... \n\nEven if all three heroes you run are different races lets say Noldor, Dwarf and Dunedain thats only three so far.\n\nLets say one of them is noble thats 4. Even if one is a ranger and another is a warrior thats still only 6. You may think it would be fairly easy to then get up to 9 with allies but the thing is the vast majority of allies are going to be the same trait as the heroes in a deck so for this example I've already given you would need something like a Rohan, Gondor and Ent ally in play alongside those heroes with the 6 traits. In the example FFG gave just Denethor and Elfhelm alone give you 6 traits but both of them have 3 each and there are not that many heroes that have 3 each the vast majority only have one or two. \n\nThen again we do have a bunch of attachments coming that will provide heroes with extra traits so those cards will make this event much more viable or at least playable in a wider variety of decks. I don't know, I see this being a very niche card considering most decks are at least somewhat thematic and run around just a few key traits and even those decks that do feature many traits will still only have 5 or 6 between their heroes and so you cannot play this card until you have a handful of different allies with different traits out. I guess its a card you want to play late game anyway for a big quest push and tons of readying so it doesn't matter quite as much that it has so much setup but there is always a chance that setup won't come together or that you will need it early game. Love the theme of this card but not sure how usable it will actually be. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2441835","commentId":2441835,"userName":"dr00","timestamp":1475552265,"content":"Rider of Rohan is one of the best things ever.\n\n \n\nand i'm still waiting for half of Dreamchaser to come out.  why can't i just have all the cards now?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2441870","commentId":2441870,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1475555771,"content":"I'm most excited about some new cancellation, but the other revealed player cards are all pretty good so far.

The dunedain act secretly and on their own in the shadows to protect the people of the Shire, Bree and the surrounding areas.\n\nRemember the LAST alliance of Elves and Men, it was exactly that a last alliance where they marched together. We do not see that in the Third Age outside of Legoland and Gimli. Contrary to Peter Jackson's nonsense there were no Elves at Helms Deep.\n\nYes part of the story is about a group of characters from a diverse range of backgrounds and races coming together to form a fellowship but other than the fellowship itself most of the races and groups of people in middle earth are actually quite wary and/or dismissive of other races. Hell the people of Bree and surrounding areas are mistrustful and scared of the Dunedain Rangers which are the only thing keeping them safe.\n\nSo yes a fellowship line-up is thematic, yes a three hunters deck is thematic. Merry pippin and treebeard is thematic. Hell you could even say that Rohan and Treebeard (and Ent allies and whatnot) are thematic when playing the Isengard Saga Box as the Ents and Huorns destroyed the fleeing uruk-hai after Helm's deep and assaulted Orthanc. They don't actually fight alongside each other but do have a common foe and both fought great battles in Rohan at the same time. A Gandalf deck heavy on eagles you could call thematic considering his connection and friendship with them. Also cross trait decks can be thematic too so long as it is people that actually did work together in some way. A Dunedain/Noldor mix is thematic. As is a Silvan/Noldor mix, a Rohan/Gondor mix or even Dwarf/Hobbit can be considered thematic.\n\nThrowing Boromir, Galadriel and Hama in a deck that has Ent and Eagle allies because they all work well together and it is a strong no nonsense deck is all well and fine. But it is not a thematic deck by any stretch of the imagination. None of these characters fought together or were even in the same place very long or at all.\n\nAlso just to be clear I'm not saying people SHOULD play thematic decks people can use whatever they want in this game which is part of why its so amazing. A hero line up or decks are not thematic just because a diverse group of characters are included though.\n\nAlso if you hunt around on the forums you would realise that it seems to be fairly accepted that the ultimate thematic way to play the game is to play campaign mode using only characters that were actually part of each scenario/quest and changing the line up following this rule as you go. These are decks built around the fellowship so your statement that decks built around the actual fellowship are considered unthematic is literally the opposite of the actual truth. Nothing is more thematic than a fellowship deck.\n\nThat is the actual fellowship however.... Your own version of the fellowship with Na'aisayah, Theoden, Erestor, Halbarad and Long dead Bard the Bowman/Dwalin is definitely not thematic just because it is a large group of peoples and traits coming together/fighting together.\n\nDoes it matter if your decks are unthematic though? Those who are actual sticklers for this and/or tolkien enthusiasts that want to use thematic decks will do so. Those who do not care so much will not.\n\nEdited October 5, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2444867","commentId":2444867,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1475709417,"content":"> The more I think about it the better the Free People seems.  Once the Sands of Harad comes out, how many people are going to make a Three Hunters deck using the new Gimli and Legolas?

Everything about it is designed to be thematic in the first place, so it feels like a tautology when people say \"but the theme of LOTR is different cultures coming together so any combination of traits is thematic\". Well, yeah, but that's a characteristic of the entire game. It's not like we're gonna see lightsabers or Sauron-aligned player cards or something actually unthematic in a general sense. So why state the obvious? When people say thematic or unthematic it's because they wanna differentiate between decks that grab characters all over Middle Earth and decks that keep characters that belong to the same  realm or might have known each other. Sure, thematic is not the word to call it, but it seems you're forgetting that, by your definition, pretty much everything (except maybe Eagles in Moria, etc) is designed to be thematic because that's the whole point of the game; there are no \"unthematic\" possible lineups in this game by your definition just like there are no unthematic possible business-related outcomes in Monopoly.

For ages, I have been running this sort of \"Free Peoples\" deck with representatives of different cultures coming together, calling it Council of Elrond.

To restrain from the logical terminology seems absurd, but there are conflicting ideas about everything.\n\nEdited October 7, 2016 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2446839","commentId":2446839,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1475825638,"content":"I think my Grima + Arwen + Cirdan the Shipwright deck is thematic because 2 out of 3 heroes are Noldor elves."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2447114","commentId":2447114,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1475848062,"content":"I don't think thematic is a terribly useful term, because it means different things to different people.  For trait-based deckbuilding, I think \"tribal\" is a better word than thematic, and there's a distinction between a thematic deck, a thematic hero lineup, and a thematic adventure.  Grima/Arwen/Cirdan isn't a thematic hero lineup, but could certainly be coupled with nothing but Noldor allies and a wealth of Noldor-restricted events and attachments.  Elrond/Elladan/Elrohir is a thematic lineup, but if it's filled with a polyglot mess of allies for Elrond to pop into play with Vilya, the deck isn't very thematic.  Treebeard/LoPippin/TaMerry is a thematic lineup, and can be coupled with a very thematic mass of ents and hobbit/ent boosting cards -- but sending that very thematic deck through Moria isn't a very thematic adventure.  Hardly any players are devoted to 100% purely thematic situations, as it would be rather limiting (and difficult) to only play Return to Mirkwood with one hero (Aragorn) and no allies.\n\n \n\nSo what's left?  There's at least thematic choices.  When I see deck notes describe a build as \"thematic\", I think that's code for \"I know this deck would be better with card X, but I'm leaving it out for a weaker card with a better thematic fit.\"  The classic example of this would be the powerful and ubiquitous Steward of Gondor.  Providing extra resources out the wazoo *is* a thematic role for the Steward of Gondor, but putting it on anyone but Denethor or his sons gives no thematic to thrill to me.  Theme isn't the only reason to leave SoG out of a leadership deck -- you could just be bored with it, or not want to conflict with somebody else in a multiplayer setting, or you may intentionally want to have the power level of the deck weaker for a more challenging game -- but sometimes it is kept out *purely to avoid a thematic disconnect*, and a player making that choice is IMO a thematic player, even if his hero grouping or ally mix would never have happened in Middle Earth.\n\n \n\nIn short, there are thematic *choices* that can be made.  They may affect hero lineup, they may affect what's in the deck, they may affect what's *not* in the deck.  Thematic isn't a binary on/off switch, it's just a consideration that may affect any part of the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2447771","commentId":2447771,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1475868934,"content":"I meant thematic with explanation.

I was pretty successful at doing that for the Hobbit quests. You can read my playthroughs with accompanying thematic descriptions at http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/author/esteledain/ [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/author/esteledain/]; I didn't do full write-ups for The Battle of Lake-town or The Battle of Five Armies, but you can find my decks for them on ringsdb: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/715/bard-s-black-arrow-a-thematic-solo-lake-town-deck-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/715/bard-s-black-arrow-a-thematic-solo-lake-town-deck-1.0] and http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/716/three-armies-eagles-and-a-giant-bear-a-thematic-bo5a-deck-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/716/three-armies-eagles-and-a-giant-bear-a-thematic-bo5a-deck-1.0] (starring Ravenhill Scout!). I'm pleased that I got Bard to one-shot Smaug (with the help of The Old Thrush and other avian support), and that The Battle of Five Armies had a minor eucatastrophic moment when the Eagles finally arrived.\n\n \n\nFor The Lord of the Rings saga campaign, the player card pool doesn't yet have all the tools I need to build the decks I want to build. In A Shadow of the Past, for example, I don't want to include Merry (since he wasn't present until they reached Buckleberry Ferry), and I want to avoid (or at least minimize) combat with the Black Riders. Spirit Pippin, Out of Sight, Hobbit Sense, and A Elbereth! Githoniel! are how I want to deal with them,  but I need a great deal of willpower to pass hide tests (until I can get set up, and then engage the Black Riders and power quest while avoiding combat with OoS/H-s). I don't want many allies, since that makes Hide tests more difficult, so I want a few cheap high willpower allies (preferably Elves or Dúnedain, though hobbits and even dwarves could be thematic) and willpower-boosting attachments. A Spirit Sam hero (which seems likely to arrive at some point) would help, since then I would start with two Spirit resources, allowing me to immediately play a 2 willpower ally.\n\n \n\nThis is just one example, but there are many cards that I'm waiting for so that my player decks can stay close to the book and have a chance at beating the quests (such as ally versions of Merry and Pippin for The Road Darkens). As the card pool grows, new options arise. Spirit Legolas should enable a Three Hunters deck that has enough willpower for The Uruk-hai (especially as we get better Rohan allies, like Rider of Rohan). The quests from the fourth and sixth boxes will be challenging, since (with the exception of Journey to the Cross-roads) I want to play them with Sam, Galadriel, and Fellowship Frodo as my heroes, and no permanent allies (Elrond and core set Gandalf are fine). Even there, though, Strider and Vanish from Sight help (using the designer-approved house rule that you can play them if you control fewer than three non-Baggins/Fellowship heroes). As the card pool continues to grow, I'm patiently hoping for the cards that will let me recreate the book.\n\nEdited October 8, 2016 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231568-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=2448506","commentId":2448506,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1475939066,"content":"Estel Edain, that's really cool.  I think trying to construct the perfectly thematic deck for a quest is a great idea, and as the deck pool grows it becomes more and more feasible.  I used the example of a lone Aragorn deck trying to beat Return to Mirkwood -- but the Strider attachment makes that dream *way more possible* than it was before.  As the pool grows, perfectly thematic adventures becomes viable against an increasing number of quests.\n\n \n\nBut at the same time, playing *exclusively* perfectly thematic adventures would be very, very limiting and I doubt anyone does it.  I could be wrong, since outside saga quests, the Gollum quests in the first cycle, and the trips to Moria in the second cycle (not thematic if you win), there's a wider variety of heroes/allies that plausibly *could* have done the task."}]}
