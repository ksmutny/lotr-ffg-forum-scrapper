For individual packs I get it form http://www.bookdepository.com/... [http://www.bookdepository.com/...] they do not charge for international shipping, so buying a single pack from them works out as about 15 bucks Australian. Most local stores sell them for 20+.. so it is cheaper and comes out way quicker, as they are very fast on mailing.\n\nFor large orders of LCG stuff I use a ebay store LotusVault... it is more expensive for a individual pack then teh book depository, but if you are getting bulk then it is cheap as... for example a complete 6 pack cycle from CoC costs $120 min from my local stores but costs about 80 bucks from here... that is a huge saving. He gets stuff pretty quickly on new release.. if you go there mention \"EyeByeThings\" so he knows I sent ya :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
