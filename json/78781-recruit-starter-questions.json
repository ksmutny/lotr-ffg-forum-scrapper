Most forums talk about deckbuilding.\n\nIs this really necessary?\n- When you buy an expantion can you play it as it is or do you have to deckbuild.\n- Does deckbuild make the game easier to play? (a bit of a challange is nice in games so why\nwould it be nice to deckbuild and make the game easier? Also what is the replay value?)\n\nI read that minimum seize of decks is 50 cards.\n- Are there rules for how many cards of a card type can be added?\n- Does a bigger deck make it easier to play?\n \n\nOther questions I have are about the soloplay I read much on forums.\nI thought it was a cooperative game for 2 players.\n- Am I wrong?\n- Is it more difficult with two players?\n- Do the many expantions make it better to even play with 4 players? What are your thoughts about it?\n\nI hope to find some awnsers that can make me decide this game is something for me.\n\n \n\nGreetings\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78781-recruit-starter-questions/?do=findComment&comment=758818","commentId":758818,"userName":"Cuendillar2","timestamp":1360044606,"content":"Can this threat be erased?
