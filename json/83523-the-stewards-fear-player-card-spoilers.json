I'm thinking Hama.  Aragorn quests, readies, and defends.  Hama attacks and recycles.  With the ring providing lore access, Aragorn pays for healing, card draw, and threat reduction (from spirit), plus all the non-tactics allies…  Find a way to boost his defense a little bit (Arwen and Dundain Warning) and you've got your questing and defending tank all rolled into one…\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83523-the-stewards-fear-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=793108","commentId":793108,"userName":"Style75","timestamp":1367950787,"content":"Those of you interested in the artwork for Hirluin the Fair should check out this page [http://anthonyfoti.deviantart.com/art/Lord-of-the-Rings-TCG-Hirluin-the-Fair-370245404], which interestingly just went live 4 hours ago.

I'm already a HUGE fan of Hirluin.  He's only 8 threat! If you can get those outlands guys in early, he can become a monster with low threat.  He could become better than Spirit Glorfindel.  Also as a side note, this is the first hero that has Ranged and isn't Tactics! Other than Aragorn, only the Dwalin ally has a sentinel and isn't tactics…. At least I'm pretty sure. (Correct me if I'm wrong) Maybe we'll start seeing those keywords spread around to the other spheres.  And, Hirluin can be customized to fit whatever role you need him to be. For example, if you needed him to be a attacker, you could include the outlands guys that boost attack.  Of course, putting all the outlands together would be more effective, but if you needed more room in your deck, that could be an interesting solution.  cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83523-the-stewards-fear-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=793895","commentId":793895,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1368145467,"content":"Gizlivadi said:\n\nNot sure if I like some of the art. Don't get me wrong, the artists are obviously talented and the technique is excellent, but I didn't picture the herdsman who gives hitpoints and who carries his cane around his sheep and that has 0 strength with a huge sword hanging from his belt, or a regular soldier from the outlands carrying such a big axe around, and that plague-doctor guy bugs me somehow… I'm nitpicking I guess, but some of the art seems a bit \"dispropotionate\" to me. The rest is completely awesome though.\n\n\n\nActually, scrap the part about the plague-doctor. Just looke up the name Telemnar to learn that he was a king of Gondor who died of a certain Great Plague after a short reign in the third age. Guess that now the art makes a little more sense, I had thought that the design had been developed from scratch."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83523-the-stewards-fear-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=794020","commentId":794020,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1368179720,"content":"legolas18 said:\n\nSo excited for this AP! I'm already a HUGE fan of Hirluin.  He's only 8 threat! If you can get those outlands guys in early, he can become a monster with low threat.  He could become better than Spirit Glorfindel.  Also as a side note, this is the first hero that has Ranged and isn't Tactics! Other than Aragorn, only the Dwalin ally has a sentinel and isn't tactics…. At least I'm pretty sure.

I guess I… Overlooked those guys. XD That is true though, it's odd that none of the tactics allies have both keywords.  But, I guess they gave guys like Haldir and Dunedain Wanderer both for a reason. If Tactics allies had both, most of the time the extra keywords would go to waste, because a lot of tactics allies specialize in one group of fighting.  Such as Vassal of the Windlord or Horseback Archer. They can attack across the table, but if they had sentinel, you wouldn't use it. But guys like Haldir can do everything fairly effectively: Quest for 2 willpower, attack any enemy with 2 attack, or defend against any enemy with 2 defense. I guess if they made tactics characters that were that well-rounded with both keywords, they might be too strong."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83523-the-stewards-fear-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=794146","commentId":794146,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1368205813,"content":"just seen your signature legolas- thats so me…haha\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83523-the-stewards-fear-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=794193","commentId":794193,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1368217348,"content":"Haha yeah.
