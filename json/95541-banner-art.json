I limit my own work to low res so im guessing other artisits do the same.\n\nRich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95541-banner-art/?do=findComment&comment=936368","commentId":936368,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1387703412,"content":"Arwen, Elladan and Elrohir are by Magali Villeneuve. Google her name for images and they'll pop up, fairly big.\n\n \n\nA nice large version of Strider is on Deviantart.com\n\n \n\nYou can find a lot of cool things by just searching for lord of the rings lcg and images. Lots of artists post their work on their personal blogs but deviantart is definitely the hub.\n\n \n\nThis is awesome as well:\n\n \n\nhttp://www.art-spire.com/wp-content/gallery/2011/aout_2011/31-08-11_daryl-mandryk/approach_to_dol_guldary.jpg [http://www.art-spire.com/wp-content/gallery/2011/aout_2011/31-08-11_daryl-mandryk/approach_to_dol_guldary.jpg]\n\nEdited December 22, 2013 by Narsil0420"}]}
