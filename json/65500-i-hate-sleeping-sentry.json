Things that ready characters or let you take cards from the Encounter Deck and Test of Wills of course."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65500-i-hate-sleeping-sentry/?do=findComment&comment=641338","commentId":641338,"userName":"Rashley","timestamp":1339034810,"content":"Removing cards from the Encounter deck - 'Out of the Wild' - leads to interesting choices and in multiplay, a lot of discussion.  There are some very nasty Treacheries out there like 'Sleeping Sentry', which make obvious candidates, but some Enemies and Locations can be more long term nuisances.  In a recent random Hero, 2 full deck/sphere replay of the first quest, I only had 5 cards in the deck, including 'Hummerhorns' and 'Ungoliants Spawn'.  Both had to be left in as 'Hummerhorns' has Victory points and I hadn't reach part 3 to see if I needed to kill the big guy.\n\nThis led me to think about what is best to remove from the game.  Within the restrictions on the card, is a nasty Treachery worse than a bad blocking Location or a really tough Enemy?  You usually get quite a bit of choice with 5 cards and the current situation makes a big difference, but a permenant removal of an Encounter card is not to be taken lightly.  'Sleeping Sentry' is a good choice, but what else is an automatic choice?  Cheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65500-i-hate-sleeping-sentry/?do=findComment&comment=641874","commentId":641874,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1339141853,"content":"Who doesn't my friend! However, I still think that \"Exhausted\" card (deal 2 damage to each exhausted character) from Journey to Rogsgobel is worse.

When you get 3-5 Enemies engaged, tough to guess that Burning Brand on the right Enemy. Assuming you've even drawn BB or Hasty Stroke and if you have latter, haven't had your resources wiped out by one of those discard 3 resources Treacheries."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65500-i-hate-sleeping-sentry/?do=findComment&comment=642367","commentId":642367,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1339252149,"content":"Titan said:\n\nAll I have to say is: Denethor!
