However, when you use his technique, he cannot quest himself. You have to exhaust all your characters that you send to quest. Faramir's ability does not trigger automatically as soon as he exhausts. Instead, you have to exhaust him to trigger that ability. \n\n2.  If an enemy defeats your defending character, you're already after the Quest phase so you don't need to calculate any threat. Furthermore, the enemy ist engaged with YOU and not with a particular character. Hence, his threat does not count in the following turns as he is engaged with you and not in the staging area. (Only threat from cards in the staging area is calculated). \n\n3. The spider gets an Attack Strength bonus only in the very first turn when it engages you, not every turn.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59856-three-questions/?do=findComment&comment=588161","commentId":588161,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1328081842,"content":"ichaos1985 said:\n\n \n\n3.

However, it will then again be the first turn of the attack of the spider, hence my wording is correct; just not detailed enough. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59856-three-questions/?do=findComment&comment=694898","commentId":694898,"userName":"csantora","timestamp":1347830602,"content":"No comment on \" '…attack made by the East Bight Patrol' seems to be an error considering it is the Forest Spider attacking.\"?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59856-three-questions/?do=findComment&comment=696238","commentId":696238,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1347988657,"content":"csantora said:\n\nNo comment on \" '…attack made by the East Bight Patrol' seems to be an error considering it is the Forest Spider attacking.\"?\n\n\n\nYeah, that is an error.  It is the Forest Spider who is attacking."}]}
