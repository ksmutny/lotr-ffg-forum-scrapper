Tonight I got all the way to PtM 3a with the core Tactics deck. As you know this is where you pick a spider to fight and there is a 0 for progress.\n\nWell of course I picked U.Spawn so I could win as soon as possible.\n\nAs I was going through the phases I automatically moved a Location card out of the staging area.\n\nDuring the turn I slaughtered US with a host of allies and my Heroes and put 2 progression tokens on the location using Legolas' ability. I went ahead and completed another turn just to clear that location. Was this even necessary or did the game end as soon as US was defeated?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88226-passage-through-mirkwood-3a/?do=findComment&comment=836518","commentId":836518,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1376198141,"content":"as soon as you killed U.
