If it is a treachery card, Goblin Sneak engages the next player, if able.\n\nSince this does not have the text: \"only once per turn\", this would mean that Goblin Sneak can pass all the way around the table (multiple times even) seeing as when he engages a new player, as instructed, he must go through his forced ability again.\n\nIs this a correct assesment?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64925-goblin-sneak/?do=findComment&comment=634288","commentId":634288,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1337666967,"content":"Yep.\n\nEach time the Sneak engages a player (either as a result of its forced effect or of a normal engagement check) its forced effect will trigger. As you noted, there is no limit to the number of times the effect can trigger within a given game round. Basically, you will keep discarding encounter cards and passing the Sneak around the table until you discard a non-treachery. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64925-goblin-sneak/?do=findComment&comment=634482","commentId":634482,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1337690417,"content":"And in solo mode?

Well, as I interpret the rules the Goblin Sneak is not longer engaged with the \"first\" player, and no attacks has happened yet since Combat is during phase 6, what’s the problem?
