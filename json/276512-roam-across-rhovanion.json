He has Sneak Attack written all over it. Placing 2 and 2 progress and questing for 2 is a great deal. More so if you play him again from hand next round (or with Hirgon).\n\nI am so excited about the player cards in this cycle. I am just a bit worried that Dale is getting almost too much. It may be beyond Outlands level by pack no. 2. But I like them more so far, they feel fresh with a new play-style. The unique warrior can be another great deal with King of Dale, potentially costing less than the attachment (like Raiment of War) you attach to him.\n\nExcited to see Woodmen. Not sure if they can get so much support, but it is a clever idea. Another way to draw cards with Haldan. And you get this new Woodmen's Path, you add Ancient Mathom and Elf-stone and you are almost set. It has been a while since I played Mathom or Stone, time to brush up.\n\nI would like to see Flight of the Eagles having the Eagle trait. They are a bit afraid of it, maybe. I am yet to try the encounter player cards. I think Flight to the Sea is much better than the ranger (also because it has a bonus shadow effect and no surge). Eagle of the North may be great, but its when revealed is likely to be wasted often, I feel.\n\nEdited May 23, 2018 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3345801","commentId":3345801,"userName":"TacticsLandroval","timestamp":1527102012,"content":"Wow.\n\nThe eagles are coming is almost certain to yield 3~4 cards drawn now.

As it is, Guarded Ceaselessly may be an option: you attach it to a location in the staging area, reduce its threat for a round, then travel, explore, draw.

You can do less, naturally, but I find it cool when you can rely on having traps pretty much every round.\n\nSo, I would not put those two together.
