It's shadow effect reads as:\n\nRemove all defending characters from combat. This attack is considered undefended.\n\nThis effect came up in a recent 2 player game and we were unsure of the wording. I assume that \"defending characters\" means just those defending that enemy since Stand Together allows multiple defenders. However my fellow player felt that the card effect means that all defenders, even those defending other enemies, are removed. That to me would make it too powerful and I still think that it is referring to that single defending.\n\nWhich would you good folks read it as? Thanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54438-captured-watchtower-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=539289","commentId":539289,"userName":"Cletus","timestamp":1318159892,"content":"Well, each attack is declared and resolved seperately.\n\nSo you declare an attacker, then declare and exaust a defender (plural in the case of Stand Together) and then resolve. Once it's resolved the defenders are no longer classed as defenders in mechanical terms and you would proceed to declare and resolve the next attack. So that (nasty) shadow card only removes defenders from that single attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54438-captured-watchtower-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=539292","commentId":539292,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1318160119,"content":"That's what I figured, but always good to check. Thank you."}]}
