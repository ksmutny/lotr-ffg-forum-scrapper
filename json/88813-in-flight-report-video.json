The Q&A did mention communicating release dates for LCGs more effectively, but that was from a Netrunner perspective, and I've come to live with the fact that these packs turn up when they turn up, roughly once a month. But there was nothing else of interest to this game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88813-in-flight-report-video/?do=findComment&comment=845458","commentId":845458,"userName":"Rainelotr","timestamp":1377020987,"content":"I can't believe I'm saying this, but thank goodness nothing more is hitting us till Oct.
