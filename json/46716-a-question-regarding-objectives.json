A FAQ entry would be welcome, I guess.\n\n \n\n \n\nI only shuffle unguarded cards back in on the basis (and its tenuous) that the card says unclaimed, and a card can only be unclaimed if you have the option to claim it but choose not to do so. A card that is guarded cannot be claimed and therefore cannot be regarded as unclaimed!\n\nOn a more practical level, I think the dungeon Jailor ruling is there to stop players leaving objectives in the staging area until they strictly have to take them to go forward in the quest. Having the hero carry an objective debilitates that hero, so ideally you leave them in the staging area for as long as possible, but may need to get rid of the gaurd card because of threat levels.\n\nHaving the dungeon jailor come along and removed those unclaimed, unguarded cards is the inherent game design intended to try and nerf that tactic, IMO.\n\nIf it could also take guarded cards, that means that next time the card came out it might be guarded by a \"lesser\" card than before, so in theory the dungeon jailor mechanic could be used to the players advantage, which is surely never the intention of game design!?\n\nDefo needs an offical FAQ ruling though, because its easy to argue either case currently.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46716-a-question-regarding-objectives/?do=findComment&comment=467856","commentId":467856,"userName":"rborkowitz","timestamp":1305272692,"content":"So then unclaimed Objective cards that are not guarded are shuffled into the deck and when they are revealed (even as a shadow card) they are placed in the staging area with a new encounter card attached.  That's what I'm understanding to be the case at any rate.\n\n \n\nSo an additional question then: Are the cards guarding the objective considered to be in the staging area (and thus add their threat) or or they inactive until a player decides to \"pop\" it by engaging the enemy guarding it or traveling to that location?  Sorry, but I find the mechanics of this quest to be a little sketchy for me.\n\n \n\nOnce again, thanks for all the help!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46716-a-question-regarding-objectives/?do=findComment&comment=467881","commentId":467881,"userName":"BudSinigaglio","timestamp":1305274703,"content":"Instead of thinking of the enemy or location as attached to the objective, I like to think that the enemy is \"carrying\" the objective card or that the objective card is lying on the ground at the location that is attached to it.
