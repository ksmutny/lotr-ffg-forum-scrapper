He follows all the normal rules, except he can attack an enemy in the staging area. You still count their defense, and he has to attack alone (usually not a problem as most characters cannot attack the staging area). Hope that helps!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100429-dunhere-card-ability/?do=findComment&comment=1002230","commentId":1002230,"userName":"guest314224","timestamp":1393935936,"content":"thanks"}]}
