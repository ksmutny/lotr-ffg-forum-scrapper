Second time we realized questing hard was really the way to go. The quest feels like one of the more classic LOTR quests where low threat and will power go a long way.  Since we realized there are only 7 enemies aside from the ancient guardian, we felt more comfortable sending most of our characters on the quest.  (and the swamp adder has a decently high engagement level at 35 which helps)  Our stage 2 was much better too, started at \"no end in sight\" where we could not use player cards to gain resources or draw cards neither of which was overly detrimental.  We were able to pass that stage before the time ran out.  Our stage 3 was the impassable marshland which might be the worst of the 3 options giving each location plus 1 threat. We struggled to make enough progress especially with the treachery that adds 2 to a locations travel points popping along the way.  In the meantime the ancient marsh dweller started getting pretty huge eventually getting up to 6 resource tokens before we felt comfortable engaging him and taking him out.  We ended up traveling to \"a treacherous swamp\" quest stage twice in a row which wasnt terrible with only alowing 5 characters per player to refresh.  After we finally passed that the end encounter was the ancient marsh dweller again was quite simple and we defeated him with ease\n\n \n\nRecap: Really enjoyed the quest, felt old-school with the emphasis on willpower and the harsh punishment for high threat (Nalir and his terrible effect accompany you again and unlike trouble in tharbad there are no quest mechanics that make his threat increase easier to bear...infact its quite the opposite as you need to raise your threat on every quest stage change).  The encounter cards really combo together in a terrible yet satisfying way that still made it a challenge especially playing the first time and not having a sound strategy.  The ancient marsh dweller can get nasty but is easily dealt with as he's not immune to player cards or anything so once you're set up you can chump then take him out without issue.\n\n \n\nLet me know if you have questions on the quest and share your experiences too"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125582-nin-in-eilph-playthrough-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1310040","commentId":1310040,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1414126789,"content":"To be honest I dont really interesting with that quest since I pretty sure that quest like a most of the quest of that cycle we forget very quick.

Each stage has 16 quest points with a time 3 forced effect of traveling to a different  stage. the unique effects are:\n\nEach player cannot ready more than 5 characters during the refresh phase\n\neach enemy in the staging area gets -20 engagement cost\n\neach location in play gets +1 threat\n\n \n\nAnd then for what its worth the 4th stage returns the marsh dweller to the staging area again and it makes an attack against each player. It requires no progress and after you kill the dweller you win. Has a time 2 effect of having the dweller making an immediate attack against each player.\n\n \n\nNalir is exactly the same in every way (really hoping we ditch him in the next quest ha)\n\n \n\nThere are no other enemies. 1 copy of the marsh dweller, 4 of the adder, and 3 of the neekerbreekers.  Worth mentioning that that the encounter set itself is pretty small. Only other set it uses is the \"weary travelers\" one which only had 3 different treacheries.\n\n \n\nSinking Bog's hassle factor has a large part to do with your own deck construction (aka how many items you run).  For the most part items are weapons or armor so you're not really attaching them to your questing characters which is the main concern.  The defense and attack reductions stink, but once you get enough allies out you wont need to worry about it. For example my friend had Haldir decked out with the new bow and rivendell blade...but had a -2 ATK because of it so it basically negated the effect of one of the items, so our original plan of killing the dweller while he sat in the staging area didnt work, but since there are only a handful of enemies if you have a few attacking characters you're ok.  I think its best to probably just let that location sit in the staging area and deal with it.  The key to this quest is questing hard and fast so with 1 threat level but 5 travel points and the fact the ability doesnt stack, it can be overcome "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125582-nin-in-eilph-playthrough-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1310320","commentId":1310320,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1414156032,"content":"Awesome answers, thanks heaps man!

I made one with lore and tactics, and both are able to get you out of the swamps regularly.\n\nI would agree with leptokurt's assessment - I haven't found the encounter deck itself too difficult, its the quest card effects that are making the scenario hard for me to beat.  The 2A stage that limits you to only one card per round is particularly tough.  If you play an ally or an attachment that means no response cards later in the round (Test of Will, Sneak Attack come to mind).  Location control is also important once again, as the locations either have pretty high threat (many are 3) or a high quest point amount to clear (4 or 5 points).  The locations in and of themselves aren't particularly bad but the limitations of the various 2A cards can make them far more difficult to clear than they ordinarily would.  I find myself getting location-locked as a result because the quest card effects prevent me from getting through them.\n\n \n\nI've been playing the scenario strictly one-handed but should have a chance to play it multi-player later this week.  It'll be interesting to see how it plays with more players.\n\nEdited November 2, 2014 by RobOz"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125582-nin-in-eilph-playthrough-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1319732","commentId":1319732,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1414957970,"content":"Yes, I agree with the above.

I don't find it overly easy so far, somewhat challenging in fact.\n\nThe locations pile up super quickly and without player cards that help against locations you are more or less screwed unless you can generate very high willpower quickly. Also if you don't kill the Marsh Dweller on stage 3 (I had it on 2 hitpoints....) its resource tokens remain on stage 4 and it is a much more formidable threat. I had it at 8 attack strength and also had it reveal TWO shadow cards that cause an additional attack during its forced attacks as part of quest stage 4A. I cancelled one with a Hasty Stroke and lost 3 chumps... (the exact amount of ready allies I had available). I then used a Feigned Voices on it during the combat phase to stop it attacking and killed it in one hit with Legolas (Bow of Galadhrim), Haldir (2 Dunedain Marks, Rivendell Blade, Bow of Galadrim) and Elrohir who had a combined attack of 15 (It was engaged with tactics/leadership so +2 to Haldir from the bow and +1 to Legoals from his). I may have smashed the Marsh Dweller fairly easily (and the other two enemies are fairly easy, did not have one survive the round it was revealed and no ill effects triggered on either attempt I had) and lost the first game mainly due to location lock but the Marsh Dweller is no joke and the quest overall seems difficult enough to me for an AP halfway through a cycle. It isn't the terribly last hard one or fairly hard second last one or one of the first two which are normally fairly easy.\n\nHad a very fun time playing it and will definitely return to this one to get a better score, experience the other quest stages (some seem much harder than others) and simply because it was a well designed, challenging and fun quest.
