They are player cards with player card backs.\n\nThe above answer is correct. To add a little more, the Over Hill and Under Hill treasures will not feature in the first quest at all. Then only if they are discovered can they be used for the rest of the saga.\n\nFor On the Doorstep, all the treasures are included in the Setup instructions of either the first or second quest. "}]}
