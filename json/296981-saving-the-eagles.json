Presuming the Guardian doesn't take damage from the attack can I use the action window between steps 6.4.3 and 6.4.4 of the combat phase to return the Guardian in my hand to still consider the attack defended and save it from its own Forced effect? (The same question could be asked about a Vassal of the Windlord and stept 6.8.3/6.8.4)\n\nOn one hand I am not totally sure if the enemy attack \"resolves\" after 6.4.3 or 6.4.4, and how it relates to an attack being undefended. If it resolves at 6.4.3 and in that Action Window afterwards it would be possibile make the defending character leave play and still consider the attack defended than it might even lead to some fun uses of our old friend coaster Keen-Eyed Took. If it resolves at 6.4.4 it would make more sense in general to me.\n\nIn any case I think that before we have access to an Action Window after the \"attack resolves\" step (whichever it is) the forced effect will take effect, having a game frame precedence over any Response or Action, so this \"combo\" does not work.\n\nEdited July 1, 2019 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296981-saving-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=3732152","commentId":3732152,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1561992174,"content":"The eagle would return to your hand and successfully be saved from its own forced discard, but then the enemy's attack would be undefended (or in the case of Vassal of the Windlord, you would be out three attack)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296981-saving-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=3732157","commentId":3732157,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1561992563,"content":"> 44 minutes ago, Alonewolf87 said:\n> \n> On﻿ one hand I am not totally sure if the enemy attack \"resolves\" after 6.4.3 or 6.4.4, an﻿d ﻿how it relates to an attack bein﻿g undef﻿e﻿n﻿﻿ded﻿.﻿﻿\n\nIt should resolve at 6.4.4, which is named \"Enemy attack ends\" and whose only text in the RR is \"This step formalizes the end of the enemy's attack.\" I don't think there's any specific reason to believe that the resolution of an attack is instantly after damage is dealt, given that 6.4.4 exists at all.\n\nSince combat damage was already dealt at 6.4.3, there's no undefended damage to deal anywhere, so you should be good with retrieving your Winged Guardian in the fashion you describe.\n\nThe timing issues are similar for the Vassal, so that should be kosher too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296981-saving-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=3732160","commentId":3732160,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1561993035,"content":"> 10 minutes ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> The eagle would return to your hand and successfully be saved from its own forced discard, but then the enemy's attack would be undefended (or in the case of Vassal of the Windlord, you would be out three attack).\n\nSee answer below\n\n> 4 minutes ago, sappidus said:\n> \n> Since combat damage was already dealt at 6.4.3, there's no undefended damage to deal anywhere, so you should be good with retrieving your Winged Guardian in the fashion you describe.\n> \n> The timing issues are similar for the Vassal, so that should be kosher too.\n\nI see opinions about the undefended part differ even here.\n\n> 7 minutes ago, sappidus said:\n> \n> It should resolve at 6.4.4, which is named \"Enemy attack ends\" and whose only text in the RR is \"This step formalizes the end of the enemy's attack.\" I don't think there's any specific reason to believe that the resolution of an attack is instantly after damage is dealt, given that 6.4.4 exists at all.\n\nThis is my position as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296981-saving-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=3732185","commentId":3732185,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1561994204,"content":"Not at liberty at the moment to dig through the FAQ, but that is where I would look for a direct answer on this question.
