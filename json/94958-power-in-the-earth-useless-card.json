Secret Paths (which is an Event) can make a greater difference, I think.\n\n \n\nAs for question two, well... yes, why not? If errata make sure that cards are not over-powered, they should be able to make mediocre cards more playable as well. But I would probably want all 4 features you mention added to even consider putting Power in the Earth in a deck. There are too many other good Lore cards out there.\n\nEdited December 10, 2013 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94958-power-in-the-earth-useless-card/?do=findComment&comment=927580","commentId":927580,"userName":"Karlson","timestamp":1386702823,"content":"Yes, quite useless!  Heck, even the artwork is disappointing.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94958-power-in-the-earth-useless-card/?do=findComment&comment=928120","commentId":928120,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1386768955,"content":"i think the artwork is beautiful and i can also think of a use for it. if you want locations in the staging area (for some quest related reason) but not its threat, then you can attatch this card. perfect!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94958-power-in-the-earth-useless-card/?do=findComment&comment=928153","commentId":928153,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1386773669,"content":"Of course you're right about the function of the card.  I'm just not sure there is ever an incentive to use it over other cards.  I can't imagine ever using a slot in my deck for that card.  The only case I can think of is if you've just got the Core Set and you don't have much choice."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94958-power-in-the-earth-useless-card/?do=findComment&comment=928288","commentId":928288,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1386783844,"content":"It should have been a tactics card.
