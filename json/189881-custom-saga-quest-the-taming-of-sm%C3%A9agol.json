So I figured I would simply use The Hills of Emyn Muil encounter set to propose a Saga Quest covering the events of the first chapter of The Two Towers (part 2).\n\nTo play this quest you need The Hills of Emyn Muil encounter set, the Sauron's Reach encounter set (from the Core Set) and both Gollum and NazgÃ»l encounter sets from The Land of Shadow and The Ring from The Black Riders. I chose to exclude the Orcs of Dol Guldur encounter set for thematic purposes and the added Gollum enemy as well as the NazgÃ»ls gives a bit of tension, on the enemy side.\n\nOf course, I've included Campaign Mode (a campaign card with instructions and a new Boon).\n\n\nOCTGN FILES\n\nYou can download the OCTGN file here [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W5XmmVe0jRjsa_F2C7KiCiG9iSNq62GQ].\n\nTo install it, download the .zip on the link above and extract it to \"MyDocuments\\OCTGN\" The scenarios can then be found on: Load pre-built deck -> Scenario\n\nEdited May 7 by banania\nmajor update"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189881-custom-saga-quest-the-taming-of-sm%C3%A9agol/?do=findComment&comment=1825701","commentId":1825701,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1443560784,"content":"Cool idea, thanks for doing this!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189881-custom-saga-quest-the-taming-of-sm%C3%A9agol/?do=findComment&comment=1825724","commentId":1825724,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1443561601,"content":"> Cool idea, thanks for doing this!\n\nSeconded...
