I think Dáin is a must have for every dwarven deck. Bifur is also a strong hero, as he gives you 3 WP and his ability is very helpful. Dwalin might be replaced by either Glóin, Gimli or Thalin, depending on what deck your partner has. If you use Thalin, keep some Gondorian Spearmen around, as this combo will destroy most of your enemies before they can harm you.\n\nUseful allies are the Archivar and all lore dwarfs in general, because they're cheap and with Bifur's ability you can play one of them each round. The Mapmaker and Bifur's ability also help you when you're questing.\n\nNarvi's Belt is quite useful as is the Dwarrowdelf Axe. A Burning Brand should be placed on Dáin early, and a Self Presevation helps to deal with damage caused shadow effects, if you don't get BB."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60676-i-could-use-some-help-with-my-dwarves/?do=findComment&comment=596314","commentId":596314,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1329722114,"content":"I think the tribal dwarf deck has yet to be realised, especially for a solo deck.

When I play I usually try to have 1 quester, 1 defender, and 1 attacker. With Thalin/Gimli/Dwalin you have 1 quester and 2 attackers. I was running this for a while as well and found you really have to hope for Ranged and Sentinel attachments to help you. I found another way to split up the Dwarves which I feel is more balanced. Now I often do: Thalin/Gloin/Gimli and Bifur/Dain/Dwalin. This fixes the problem stated above and re-balances each players heroes. Bifur/Dain/Dwalin is even a good solo deck. The only problem with this is splitting up the Leadership cards if you only have 1 core set (which I do) but I didn't find it too hard to do.\n\nAlso you have to watch out for card draw with the Dwarves, they're not great at it.
