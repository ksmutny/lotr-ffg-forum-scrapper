Personally I like to mix things up with topics that might fit around my deckbuilding series, for example my last article talked about the concept of soft-countering, while the current article (not being of the theory type) takes a look at one combo that does exactly that (soft-countering, enemies that is). I hope that those articles somehow will feel \"interlaced\" to a certain degree, nor sure if I succeed though. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66326-i-am-thinking-about-starting-a-series-of-articles-about-lotrlcg/?do=findComment&comment=674509","commentId":674509,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1345079215,"content":" Ever Onward\n\njavascript:void(0);/*1345097213295*/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/index.html/_/lord-of-the-rings/forging-your-fellowship-4-like-a-hobbit-goin-r254]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66326-i-am-thinking-about-starting-a-series-of-articles-about-lotrlcg/?do=findComment&comment=674664","commentId":674664,"userName":"Emrad","timestamp":1345108157,"content":"Cool articles, they seem to be a nice tool for beginners.\n\n \n\nWhen I have time, I might think about writing a couple of articles myself.
