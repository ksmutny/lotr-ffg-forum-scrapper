Also, regarding to a list I found here www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/] the quantity should be 3.\n\nAlso the deck sizes are different. Spirit + Lore both field 38 cards (including a Gandalf each) whereas Tactics and Leadership only field 35 cards. Am I cards missing?\n\nRegarding the content of the Core Set, I only found a list where I could look up specific cards and their quantity in the set. This way it would take me ages to figure out if or how many cards might be missing from my set.\n\nRegards and thanks for any help in advance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55966-incorrect-core-set-contet/?do=findComment&comment=553181","commentId":553181,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1320686709,"content":"It seems you have been quite lucky.

But I couldnt find a detailed description of the core sets content anyway. Looking up every single card from that list I postet would be a horrific task to say the least :S\n\n \n\nAnyone got such a list at hand?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55966-incorrect-core-set-contet/?do=findComment&comment=553402","commentId":553402,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1320737771,"content":"lotrlcg.com <- hit just \"core\" at the \"All Expansion\" drop down menu"}]}
