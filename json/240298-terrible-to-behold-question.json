I think I know the answer, but I've been wrong before - the text on some of these cards can be tricky.  \n\n \n\n \n\nffg_MEC52_111.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_MEC52_111.jpg]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/240298-terrible-to-behold-question/?do=findComment&comment=2599329","commentId":2599329,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1484873084,"content":"It's because you can declare a defender against an enemy engaged with you or, if the hero is sentinel (or through another card effect) and is declared against an enemy engaged with another player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/240298-terrible-to-behold-question/?do=findComment&comment=2599332","commentId":2599332,"userName":"Excs0","timestamp":1484873440,"content":"Yeah, that's what I was thinking, but I always like hearing from others. (I had leadership hero Gimli in mind while looking at this card).

It's certainly playable against enemies that are \"considered to be engaged\": FAQ entry 1.50 makes it quite clear that if an enemy is considered to be engaged, it triggers effects that say \"if an enemy is engaged with you\", but it does NOT trigger effects that say \"when/after an enemy engages you / you engage an enemy\".\n\n \n\nSo this card can trigger; the question is whether you can \"return [an] enemy to the staging area\" when that enemy was already in the staging area, and merely considered to be engaged with you. And I'd agree with dr00 that you cannot \"return\" something to the place where it already is. Therefore, the part before the word \"Then\" cannot be resolved, and so the part after the word \"Then\" does not resolve either. And so this card is legal to play against enemies that are considered to be engaged with players, but it whiffs against them, so playing it would be merely a waste of a Leadership resource.\n\n \n\nEDIT: I accidentally typed \"And I'd agree with dr00 that you can \"return\" something to the place where it already is\" when I meant that you cannot return something to the place where it already is.

Yeah, I can accept that. Better to play it this way to keep on the safe side, right?  \n\nEdited January 23, 2017 by Excs0"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/240298-terrible-to-behold-question/?do=findComment&comment=2603780","commentId":2603780,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1485154501,"content":"Can you play cards whose effects do nothing in LOTR?
