I just recently discovered that there were alt arts for heroes given out at past gencons. I’ve been trying every outlet online looking for the boromir and gimli alt art. I was wondering if anyone here would be interested in selling either boromir or gimli? I don’t have anything to trade, but would be willing to pay for them. Thanks! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280506-looking-for-boromir-or-gimli-alt-art/?do=findComment&comment=3431102","commentId":3431102,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1533580656,"content":"I don't have those specific two (though I also am on the lookout for the Boromir), and It'll be very hard to find one.
