Very low starting threat, which is nice against the Troll. I found that the deck won when I got a lot of allies out, and lost if I couldn't.\n\nSo I've taken that to its logical extreme, by now including every ally from those 3 spheres in the deck. With 3 Gandalfs, that's 34 allies I believe. Added in 16 other cards to make the 50 and will play it for the ifrst time later this week. Obviously it won't work against Dol Guldur, but I have high hopes for Anduin.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49048-just-got-an-overall-score-of-a-26-defeating-quest-2/?do=findComment&comment=491414","commentId":491414,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1309142680,"content":"DurinIII said:\n\n Quest 2 has been giving me some trouble for quite sometime until I finally just tried mixing 3 spheres...it kicked butt on the first round!  I mixed Spirit (Eowyn), Lore(Beravor), and Leadership (Gloin).

If you can, include the new Song of Kings and Dunedain Mark (plus any other Leadership card you'd find most fit - but never too many). I am, of course, not sure whether this is the best solo deck but so far, out of many tries, it has been surely most fun to play with. Dunhere and Legolas are apt assassins whilst Eowyn does all the questing. If you get Unexpected Courage, always place it on Dunhere so you can target more than 1 enemy from the staging area, or one more than once. Once in a while, either of the two can help you quest so that Eowyn does not get all the negative effects, aka Necromancer's Reach or Dol Guldur Orc Bastards. Surely include Northern Tracker and never travel. I am sure you'd know all this but just for the record, take Tactics aces like Feint and Blade of Gondolin but also those not so famous as Blade Mastery or Quick Strike. Befriend Beorn also, he is most great with Quick Strike. If you include Sneak Attack (from the Leadership cards provided via Song of Kings) and Stand and Fight, you will have three different choices how to get Beorn into play. And once you do, you'll be glad you have."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49048-just-got-an-overall-score-of-a-26-defeating-quest-2/?do=findComment&comment=492030","commentId":492030,"userName":"Iver2","timestamp":1309230207,"content":"guys, are you all talking about solo play?
