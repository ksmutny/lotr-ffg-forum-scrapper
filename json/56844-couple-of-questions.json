From p.6 of the FAQ: \n\nQ: When do \"after this enemy attacks\" Forced effects like those on Chieftan Ufthak (CORE 90) and Wargs (CORE 85) resolve?\nA: These effects resolve immediately after step 4 of enemy attack resolution.\n\nStep 4 of enemy attack resolution is \"determine combat damage\" (rule book, p.18). So, Ufthak will gain his first resource token after damage from his first attack has been determined (i.e. his first attack will be strength 3).\n\n2. Yes, absolutely. The only thing you can't do is attack the same enemy more than once during a given combat phase. However, with Unexpected Courage (or similar effects like Boromir's readying ability) a single hero can certainly attack multiple different enemies.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56844-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=561008","commentId":561008,"userName":"Drengi","timestamp":1322446963,"content":"sorry perhaps im being blind...\n\n \n\n But Unexpected Courage requires an action phase to be played non? and there is not one between enemy attacks and your attacks, meaing that it can NOT be used to ready a hero who defended and then make an attack (or double attack)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56844-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=561028","commentId":561028,"userName":"ShadowGhost2","timestamp":1322451149,"content":"Drengi said:\n\nsorry perhaps im being blind...\n\n \n\n But Unexpected Courage requires an action phase to be played non? and there is not one between enemy attacks and your attacks, meaing that it can NOT be used to ready a hero who defended and then make an attack (or double attack)\n\n\n\nNo, you are not blind. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Just missed a minor detail on page 30 of the Rule Book.\n\n\"• Green – Any player can take actions generally, or\nbetween the game steps stated in the rules.\"\n\nSo in Combat phase only the \"Deal 1 shadow card to each enemy.\" step is uninterruptible, all those green steps are free to play any actions.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56844-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=561030","commentId":561030,"userName":"Drengi","timestamp":1322451626,"content":"That just changed a lot of what I have been doing! lol\n\n \n\n Thanks for clearing that up for me!"}]}
