It may be the most powerful single card in a strong set.\n\nArwen - As previous posters have said, another winner.\n\nElrond's Counsel - 3 threat reduction and +1 will for the cost of just the card?  I will take it.  Especially when the only requirement is that you get Arwen into play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63626-arwen-undomiel/?do=findComment&comment=622939","commentId":622939,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1335548949,"content":"Believe me, this card looks better than it is.
