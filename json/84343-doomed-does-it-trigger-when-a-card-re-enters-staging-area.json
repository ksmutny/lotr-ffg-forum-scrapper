I always played that surge and doom only trigger on reveal.. and NOT when going back to staging area. The keyword \"reveal\" is pretty well defined as coming off the encounter deck. Still I am absolutely certain that guarded triggered anytime a objective went into the staging area from any gamezone."}]}
