I can see how the more players you have the harder it will become to deal with location pile up. Just wanted to see what everyone's opinion is on this issue as this was the only glaring weakness in this game compared to AGoT LCG. I went with LotR and so far with two Core Sets(haven't even opened the 2nd yet) I'm having a blast."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46770-4-players-possible/?do=findComment&comment=468384","commentId":468384,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1305373338,"content":"I don't see why technically this wouldn't work, although people are generally finding the more players, the easier the game is (although you add one extra card per player, you get 3 more heroes to deal with that card, so overall, more players = easier game, generally speaking)\n\nthere are a few threads on game difficulty and scaling though which contain a few different house rules etc to try and keep the game challenging with 4 players etc, perhaps give those a read if you are considering trying with 5+ players...\n\nAnother alternative is to give each player only 2 heroes? that's probably also going to keep the challenge levels up due to the lower resource generation each deck will have..?

E.g. no one is preventing you from declaring the game an auto-win if you get three Gandalf cards on your starting hand. cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]\n\nMore seriously, considering how easy the game gets with four players, I wouldn't do this. Instead, reduce the number of heroes per player. The rules already mention you can play with a lower number of heroes (1-3)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46770-4-players-possible/?do=findComment&comment=468728","commentId":468728,"userName":"BudSinigaglio","timestamp":1305454553,"content":"Lightdarker said:\n\n \n\nElven Archer said:\n\n \n\nSinnerfold:\n\nWe also have experimented with 5 and 6 player games.

We save Eleanor for things like this, we don't just let her exhaust for any treachery card. We also try to hold onto any \"A Test of Will\" cards to help cancel these effects as well. But once we did reveal 2 Necromancer's Reach cards and we didn't have any of the aforementioned cards in reserve. We lost lots of allies that day. Sometimes the game just knows how to fight back."}]}
