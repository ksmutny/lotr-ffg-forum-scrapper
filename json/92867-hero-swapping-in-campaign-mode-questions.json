But I have three questions on that:\n\n1. What if I add a hero to my lineup, where I did not have one before? For example, I had only two heroes, Merry and Pippin, but I decide to add Bilbo to the lineup.\n\n2. If I swap someone out, in a future scenario, if I swap them back in, do I need to pay the threat penalty again? So, I had Glorfindel in the first BR scenario, swap him out for Aragorn in the second, but swap him back in for Aragorn for the third?\n\n3. If a player swaps heroes with another, is there a threat penalty? So, I swap Merry and Fatty between mine and my wife's deck, do we pay a penalty?\n\nThanks!\n\nÂ "}]}
