There should be 2470 DIFFERENT cards (=Player, quest and encounter cards. This includes boon, burdens etc.), excluding nightmare . Only a few exceptions have more than 3 copies, e.g. Gandlaf. I counted cards that apear in different quests, but are completly the same (e.g. Arwen in the 2 first Dwarrowdelf quests) only once.\n\n2470/9 = 274,4 so you will probably need at least 275 pages. If you can use the front and back of the same page you obviously only need half of them. Note that quite some cards (mainly the quests) have a printed backsides, so you might want them to be visible, what would up the number of pages need again.\n\nI think you should be able to fit at least 20 pages into a binder (but I don't store my cards this way so take everything I say here with caution). 275/20 = 13,75 So 14 pages should be realistic. Again if you use the front and back of a page only half the amount will be needed.\n\n \n\nIf someone is curious: The TOTAL amount of cards, excluding nightmare, should be 5123. Of these \"only\" 1696 are player cards (=33,1%). Of the 2470 unqiue cards, 660 are player cards (=26,7%).\n\nIncluding nightmare we have a TOTAL of 6563 cards. Lowering the amount of player cards to 25,8%. The amount of unique cards rises to 3075 with a player card percentage of 21,5%. \n(Note that the freshly released NM decks for the second half of the dreamchaser cycle weren't listed at Hall of Beorn and, as I don't own them myself, I was unable to include them in the unique card calculation. I did however assume 20 cards per quest as I did with every other NM quest, this way they are already included in the total cards sum.)\n\nChecking my numbers is appreciated, as a mistake could have slipped in very well :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/275788-storage-3x3-pocket-pages-how-many-do-we-need-now/?do=findComment&comment=3328982","commentId":3328982,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1526140235,"content":"1) How many of the cards are player cards?  The rest (quest, encounter) could be considered \"spoilers\" so could be kept in boxes.  Hopefully the number of player cards is relatively small compared to the others!\n\n2) I have some old card-holding sheets from the MECCG days and each sheet has 9 slots total, each slot wide enough to fit one card facing each way.  So, if it's only for display, you can fit 18 cards total (9 on the front and 9 on the back).  You can also fit a third card in each slot, but definitely not 6.  So, that type of sheet would fit 9 unique cards total, with up to 3 copies of each card in each slot.  Are there other types of sheets that either fit more cards per slot, or have separate slots for the front and back sides of each sheet?\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/275788-storage-3x3-pocket-pages-how-many-do-we-need-now/?do=findComment&comment=3329135","commentId":3329135,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1526151124,"content":"> 3 hours ago, tripecac said:\n> \n> Are there other types of sheets that either fit more cards per slot, or have separate slots for the front and back sides of each sheet?﻿  \n> \n>  \n\nYes.
