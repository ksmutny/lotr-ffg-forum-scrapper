This means that players will have to “discover” it in the first quest of the box in order to use it in subsequent scenarios, but it also means that once you play it on Bilbo Baggins it cannot be targeted by cards that affect Attachments.\" - Caleb (my emphasis)\n\nFull text here, near the bottom of the article: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3449 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3449]\n\nI do not have The Hobbit.  Is there anything in the accompanying rules that explicitly states that Treasure cards are not considered Attachments? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70119-attachment-faq-clarification-request/?do=findComment&comment=691327","commentId":691327,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1347314243,"content":" There's nothing in the rules (that I recall); however it is worth noting that the a treachery card in the Hobbit which target's attachments states \"Discard all non-treasure, non-objective attachments in play\" (emphasis mine).  \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't be surprised if the FAQ was updated to state that treasure cards are not affected by encounter cards unless specifically mentioned.\n\n \n\n "}]}
