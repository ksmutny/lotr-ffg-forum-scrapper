That probably means that the situation is more complex than I thought.\n\nI've only been playing for about 6 weeks, I bought a core set, liked it then bought the Mirkwood expansions, they arrived 2 weeks ago and Khadad Dum arrived last week.

The expansions brought new quests and more importantly, more player cards. The songs made 3 sphere decks a real possibility, play testing showed them to be more flexible than my previous decks. I could now build 50 card decks and my deck building skills increased again, maybe to 6 out of 10. I was beating the new quests on the first or second attempt, without knowing what the quest was, using a \"generic\" deck. The only exception was Rhosgobel, my playing partner knew this quest and played a deck with lots of healing and picked when to move onto the last stage of the quest.\n 4. This was the first time I noticed that my play style was improving, I was better able to judge the pace of the game, and \"knew\" when to push to complete a quest stage, and when to hold back and build up my board position. My play skill had gone from 1 (out of 10) to 5 without me really noticing. Sadly, my playing partner and I were developing different strategies that didn't always work well together.\n 5. Then came Khazad Dum. The quests seemed tricky to start with. I was playing 2-player again and we did defeat all the quests pretty much on the first attempt but they were really hard and took good play to deal with the new situations that came up. There was a sense of doom as the enemies kept coming, groans at the new treacheries. Again I was using a \"generic\" deck and hadn't read the quests in advance, so didn't know what was coming up. Now I have played the quests several times (both 2-player and solo) I'm in the \"too easy\" camp but interestingly, not because they are really too easy! I enjoy the games, but knowing what is around the corner takes away that \"seat of your pants\" feeling, winning doesn't seem as rewarding and I come away wishing for more challenge so I can relive those early experiences.\n 6.

I only suggest to FFG make a future quests with possability to increase difficutl level by adding some additional rules. But i wont official rules not home made. They should be balanced by the designers.\n\nCose most of the game what we play in co-op we win 90%. Only one we lost sometimes is Osgiliath. All other quests for now include Into the pit(KD) we win all the time. But KD is much more harder anaway so we love that.  Now we come to the point to play with some encounter cards doubled (like put 2 U spown or 3 Caught in the web instead 2) this make game alos more difficult.

People simply complaining that the quests are too easy and that they never lose often only do that (complain) without substantiating it with what they find makes it easy. For example, is it just the win ratio (I have a 90 % + win ratio hence I find the game too easy)? The speed at which a game ends (Passage through Mirkwood, Journey to Rhosgopel and The Dead Marshes can all be over in 2 rounds, hence they are too easy)? The lack of challenge provided by the encounter deck (a deck containing only 1-power enemies wouldn't be deemed much of a challenge)? On the other hand, it'd be interesting to hear these people state what they'd find challenging. Personnally, I find challenge and meaning in the game when the decisions the player make have an impact on the outcome. This game is (or should be - I won't restart about Zigil... hopefully) about managing your resources and making the right decisions at the right time (there's also the Tolkien lore aspect which pleases a lot of people, meself included, but that doesn't factor into the assessment of difficulty). If you win a scenario independantly of your deck, your hand or any decision you make, that scenario is probably too easy.\n\nExperience in card games: this is a very important factor. There were reference to players having played Magic before or other LCG being potentialy better LoTR players or finding this game easier than newcomers. This is a true fact of any card game. LoTR doesn't require past experience with LCG (because it's Coop, it's totally different from other LCG; when Star Wars gets out, LoTR players will probably have an edge), but it does require certain skills and understanding of basic concepts. The Boromir's Guide articles were great in that respect: I didn't learn much that I didn't knew about, but they covered the basics: resource management (not in the LoTR sense, but in the broader sense), maximizing synergy, focusing on card draw and resource acceleration, etc. These concepts soon become ingrained in your mind once you know them. But you need to get a good grasp at them (and going over each and every one of them would be a whole other discussion).\n\nKnowledge of the quests: this is a normal factor in any game. Knowing the specifics of the game makes radical differences in how you play. For example, knowing the kind of \"when revealed\" effects you may face could change a lot of decisions. If you fear a card such as The Necromancer's Reach (1 point of damage to each exhausted character), you probably won't quest with a character having a single hit point left. In the same vein, you'll wait until the Combat phase before drawing with Gleowine, even if you would have had the resources to play the card had you drawn during your pre-quest phase. Another example is for the 1st player to not quest with a single hero when facing the new KD treachery that makes you sacrifice a questing character. Knowing how Hunt for Gollum or Journey to Rhosgopel are setup, you won't advance too soon until you have clues or healing for the eagle. This is one of the reason why everyone thinks quests are initialy harder, but they then become easier as you know what to expect and learn to play around the encounter deck's tricks. The same logic would apply to a PvP game if your opponent was always using the same deck or strategy.\n\nCard Pool: That was pointed out earlier as a factor. Owning 3 Core Sets, I tend to forget it, but it's true that it makes a huge difference whether or not you have access to 1 or 3 Unexpected Courage (totally changes your relationship to Beravor, for example). I found myself surprised at a decklist once where they only had 2 The Galadhrim's Greetings, so used am I to systematicaly playing with 3. The game is probably designed more for players owning a single core set, so players with access to more cards will generally find it easier. Also, with each expansion, they are bringing new cards that can generate unsuspected advantages for the players against earlier quests. This is a normal evolution of this game where the opponent is static (that is, until they decide, as was suggested by some, to produce \"upgrades\" to existing quests). In a PvP, it's less of a problem because your opponents also get new cards, but here, Journey Down the Anduin doesn't get new critters from Kazad Dum, for example, but who's to say we won't be getting more and more cards allowing us to deal with enemies in the staging area (or, who knows, maybe a The Sun Rises card that will turn Trolls to stone!), making the quest increasingly easier as time passes.\n\nKnowledge of the rules: this one is less of a factor, but it does play a role. How many players did we see bragging about their first wins and then someone pointed out they played 2 copies of Steward of Gondor? Obviously, one would find the game easier if they were not respecting the Unique rule, for example.\n\nI hope this addresses some of the OP's questions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59448-difference-in-player-opinions-debate/?do=findComment&comment=584259","commentId":584259,"userName":"player1041350","timestamp":1327423700,"content":"  I started playing LotR LCG just before christmas and completing the quest is not the big thing for me.

Also, some people like a solid challenge and some don't. My friend and I don't mind a challenge but when the quests are so tough we do find ourselves getting fed up and our love of the game begins to dry up. We both bought this game for solo play but do meet up once a week to play 2-4 player games. We both dislike the difficulty level of the game that I tweaked the solo rules and my friend insists that you need 4 heroes and a threat cap of 75, and that's how he plays. A few hardcore CCG players we taught the game to  last week agreed with him after three games that four heroes is a must due to the difficulty of the game.\n\nTo some players a really tough challenging game makes them dig the game out over and over, but to some of us (more casual types) we want a fair game with a small amount of difficulty. Not so we win every game but where we feel we have a reasonable chance and it does seem that FFG have made this game to be overly difficult."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59448-difference-in-player-opinions-debate/?do=findComment&comment=584633","commentId":584633,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1327490808,"content":"The_Big_Show said:\n\nI think it's a mixture of player competence, deck building ability and blind luck.\n\n\n\noh yeah i completely forgot about the luck thing. on that note i am actually the unluckiest person ever, seriously, its not even funny, im like a walking curse demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59448-difference-in-player-opinions-debate/?do=findComment&comment=584645","commentId":584645,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1327491645,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nThe_Big_Show said:\n\n \n\nI think it's a mixture of player competence, deck building ability and blind luck.\n\n \n\n \n\noh yeah i completely forgot about the luck thing. on that note i am actually the unluckiest person ever, seriously, its not even funny, im like a walking curse demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]\n\n\n\nDO\n\n \n\nNOT\n\n \n\nTOUCH\n\n \n\nANYTHING IN THIS THREAD\n\n \n\npreocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59448-difference-in-player-opinions-debate/?do=findComment&comment=584655","commentId":584655,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1327492311,"content":" \n\nObviously a great deal of it comes down to player competence, but I think a lot of the \"quest X is a piece of cake\" debate comes down to two things:\n\n1. Card pool\n\n2. Number of players\n\n \n\nFor the first one, I think that mainly splits into two groups - those that play with only 1 core set (and hence have less than the possible 3 in the hand of each card) and those that play with multiple core sets. The other sub set is those that only play with cards released at the time the adventure was released (which is what I try to do at least initially) and those that use any of their card pool against any specific quest - the second group probably have an easier time of it than the first.\n\nAs for my second point, that's all been said before - the game doesn't scale perfectly with increasing number of players and generally having more players does make the game easier.\n\nPerhaps we should come up with a standard terminology for describing how the particular session is played (number of players, available card pool etc) so that we can realistically begin to compare why someone else thinks something is p*ss easy when I or richsabre struggle to get past round 2!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59448-difference-in-player-opinions-debate/?do=findComment&comment=584694","commentId":584694,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1327497991,"content":"There is no post in this thread at the moment that I could disagree.\n\n \n\nThe points were all already exploited as to why someone would think the game is easy and others do not.\n\nBut there is one obscure point no one touched (and it baffles me): Why someone would SAY the game is too easy.\n\n \n\nC'mon. I believe I saw three threads with people asking for assistance and/or ideas and there was always someone saying something along these lines: \"Oh, this quest is easy, all you need to do is X.\" I mean... Seriously? Couldn't it be phrased a little less self-assertive?\n\n \n\nI played Magic when I was around thirteen and hated it. The game is simply bad when it comes to strategy, so I really not sure if this is a factor to weight when it comes to 'player experience'.\n\nThe way I see, this game (lotr) is more complex, and thus, more compelling to the most mature audience.\n\n \n\nWits and experience are the major factors of this game. Knowing when to push to the next quest and when to wait a little longer is crucial, as is knowing if you should risk questing like-there-is-no-tomorrow while holding a Grim Resolve even when playing Rhosgobel, etc. The experience mixed with the wits tells you that, not one, not the other, but BOTH.\n\nWhile the wits is a very discernible trait, the experience is a little foggy; is it enough knowing how your deck works? How about the encounter decks? Is your experience in another LCG similar, and if so, would it help you? The experience is gained through play, and as another guy said before: sometimes you don't even notice it, you start to see things more clearly as you play more and more.\n\n \n\n \n\nTL;DR: This game is a lot of things, but it is not easy (and it shouldn't, you're supposedly fighting against all odds, not just hunting a stray bunny).\n\nI will never believe that someone played the game for the first time and just beat every scenario that was put in front of him, unless he is a genius or something like that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59448-difference-in-player-opinions-debate/?do=findComment&comment=585516","commentId":585516,"userName":"Iver2","timestamp":1327644195,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nThe_Big_Show said:\n\n \n\nI think it's a mixture of player competence, deck building ability and blind luck.\n\n \n\n \n\noh yeah i completely forgot about the luck thing. on that note i am actually the unluckiest person ever, seriously, its not even funny, im like a walking curse demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]\n\n\n\nMy wife would now cry out loud and claim she is the unluckiest person on this planet!

Then cut the deck into to piles and shuffle those piles individually. Now, just crush those piles together., cut , crush.. and you should have a nicely done shuffling.. as you get better the need for the pick up method will go away, but it is good for that initial randomization when you are compulsive about ordering your decks.
