This is because your browser will be loading a javascript file filled with names of player cards for the auto-complete feature. After the initial load, your browser should cache this file, so the slowness should be a one-time event. Now, when you type in the query box, autocomplete suggestions will be displayed. Only player cards and unique encounter cards are included, since I don't suspect people are often searching for minor encounter cards, and I don't want to clutter the auto-complete file too much. Let me know what you guys think!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125951-hall-of-beorn-card-search-has-nin-in-eilph-player-cards-and-auto-complete/?do=findComment&comment=1315178","commentId":1315178,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1414557789,"content":"You are a champion, time to proxy the **** out of that bow =D\n\nEdited October 29, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125951-hall-of-beorn-card-search-has-nin-in-eilph-player-cards-and-auto-complete/?do=findComment&comment=1315182","commentId":1315182,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1414557978,"content":"> You are a champion, time to proxy the **** out of that bow =D\n\n \n\nWe had a 4-player game last week and Haldir and Legolas each had one Rivendell Blade and one Bow of the Galadhrim.
