(Dwarves, Gondor ect.)  I am the most intersted in the quest.  But still am interested in player cards.   I'm thinking a bottom 3 would be:\n\nShadow and Flame\n\nThe Battle of Laketown\n\nLong Dark or OHaUH?\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nKhamul"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84507-veteran-player-next-buy/?do=findComment&comment=800333","commentId":800333,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1369913219,"content":"Hey khamul\n\ni would say return to mirkwood….i know i said it was aweful solo play, but thats before i played it 2 handed. its a great quest that way. the theme is great, its a fun quest and even taking dain out of the equation, theres actually some very decent all round cards in there such as dunedain sentinel attatchment and the support of the eagles\n\nthe long dark is very easy….which isnt perhaps a bad thing if you want a deck to take it easy on or try out new thematic decks.\n\ni remember you asked perviosuly about HoN or the hobbit expansions. i would say that its not an easy answer, but as i said previously on the thread HoN is very difficult, more so than the hobbit quests. but its fun, peril in pelargir is certainly not too difficult.\n\ndo you have massing at osgilliath? thats a great quest- one of my favourites. its not as difficult as it used to be with certain cards. i know my beorn/hama/legolas + flight deck can take it\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84507-veteran-player-next-buy/?do=findComment&comment=800352","commentId":800352,"userName":"Zalrus9","timestamp":1369915599,"content":"I would say if you do get HoN, get The Steward's Fear as well, as what you get in that pack will help you immensly with your quests. It won't make it a cakewalk, but it will help you out (Unlike some, I do find no shame in running outlands decks). Also The Steards's Fear has a really cool quest, as it's like The Hills, but better.\n\nI also agree with rich to get return to mirkwood. I'm not too hot on the quest, but you do get Dain, and more importantly, you get Eagles of the Misty Mountains, perhaps my favorite ally card. \n\nHonestly, the first Saga Expansion is good too. and if you want to be a bear warrior, then that's the thing to get.\n\nGood luck!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84507-veteran-player-next-buy/?do=findComment&comment=800366","commentId":800366,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1369918851,"content":"@RichI do not have MaO and have heard by many that it's a good quest.  To this day do you still have fun playing it?  \n\n@Zalrus9  Thanks man!  I suppose it would help to get SF for HoN.  \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84507-veteran-player-next-buy/?do=findComment&comment=800372","commentId":800372,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1369920342,"content":"yes, very much so. its got that perfect mixture of theme and fighting. and of course you get to face the witch king…that alone is worth it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84507-veteran-player-next-buy/?do=findComment&comment=800375","commentId":800375,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1369920932,"content":"So you would rank RtM one of the best for 2+ players?  I just got a freind in to this game which is super cool for me since he's the first person ever that I know that plays the game other than me.  According to hours of research and these 2 answers, I think my next buys will prob be:\n\nMassing\n\nReturn to Mirkwood\n\nOn the Doorstep - Do you guys think these are some of the best quests?  how are they solo and how are they 2 plauers?\n\n \n\nThanks\n\nKhamul\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84507-veteran-player-next-buy/?do=findComment&comment=800377","commentId":800377,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1369921115,"content":"well solo massing and RTM is very difficult….very very difficult with a small card pool, but perhaps better with the newer cards.\n\non the doorstep is perhaps easier solo. the quests are harder than overhill and underhill. the last one with bolg has amazing artwork.\n\noverall i would say on the doorstep is harder than massing and RTM\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84507-veteran-player-next-buy/?do=findComment&comment=800380","commentId":800380,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1369921470,"content":"Thanks.
