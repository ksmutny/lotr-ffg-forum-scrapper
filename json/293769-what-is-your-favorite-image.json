I love having Gandalf or any of the other allies who last for 1 round come up to The Stormcaller in a little row boat, hack at some tentacles of the sea monster, and mid battle hop back in their row boat and paddle away again!\n\nWhat are some other great images?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293769-what-is-your-favorite-image/?do=findComment&comment=3674839","commentId":3674839,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1554998909,"content":"Legolas riding on Arod, a Rohan Warhorse and riding an Eagle (Support of the Eagles), it's like he's riding a Pegasus. I had another player complain about it thematically once him riding two mounts and eagles. But I just pointed out that in the Hobbit movie he did ride on two dwarfs heads while flowing down a river, so therefore I should be able to stand on and ride his Dwarf heroes around hahaha.\n\n \n\nSwcond favourite is Boromir always being ready, fighting everyone and all the while your threat credit card slowly rising up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293769-what-is-your-favorite-image/?do=findComment&comment=3674850","commentId":3674850,"userName":"Felswrath","timestamp":1554999612,"content":"I also love having the Riddermark's Finest ride a Wild Stallion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293769-what-is-your-favorite-image/?do=findComment&comment=3675540","commentId":3675540,"userName":"Schrodinger&#039;s Hat","timestamp":1555037963,"content":"> 10 hours ago, Felswrath said:\n> \n> I also love having the Riddermark's Finest ride a Wild Stallion.\n\nSteady on old chap, this is a G-rated game.\n\nOne of my favourite is hero Treebeard with A Burning Brand. I picture him turning in circles with his arm on fire as wargs desperately throw themselves out the way, with him saying “uh, guys? A little help please?”"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293769-what-is-your-favorite-image/?do=findComment&comment=3675570","commentId":3675570,"userName":"Felswrath","timestamp":1555041014,"content":"> 49 minutes ago, Schrodinger's Hat said:\n> \n> Steady on old chap, this is a G-rated game.\n> \n>  \n\nI knew someone was going to misinterpret it that way!
