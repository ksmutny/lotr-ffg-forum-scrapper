As you are a part of the community, I'd like to hear your thoughts on these 1v1 matches via the link. Feel free to vote throughout December, check the description for the times at which the stages will close and open. Our winner will be decided at New Year's Eve, making the quest the first one I will play in 2019.\n\nCheck this link for the bracket: https://challonge.com/FaveLOTRQuest2018 [https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fchallonge.com%2FFaveLOTRQuest2018%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2YXu9-tZb8NbVnOQ5odECXsNL4stNlSXRwJOPDmxbdSiWK0DzqXfMmtNY&h=AT1_L-knQ80uUHkdwKqa8IB96B_JKHIoFjW657scPQvGuOdsYCIC_-aCU4tfF5GF0e7KpUHINP6VwsSO2fC6CREuXUAe1_rL9okml3z0F_WfOmRSd5Zz1woiG883luRJ19rfjdOwu7An6z4XWLLY-GdR]\n\nUpdates will appear in the Discord server and via the forums where the opening of new stages will be announced.\n\nIf you have any questions, please read the description first, if that doesn't answer it, feel free to comment down below. Funny or interesting decisions between quests are also nice to hear about in the comments.\n\nMay the best quest win!\n\nDurins_Father"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286791-favourite-quest-as-of-december-2018/?do=findComment&comment=3547310","commentId":3547310,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1543235264,"content":"With over 100 different quests to choose from, let's find out what scenario of LOTR LCG is the favourite one of the community. We have had some strong additions over the past few years, including the entire saga of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings books. On top of this, we have the 2 new quests from the Limited Edition Two Player set, and a lot of new regular scenarios from the cycles. Let the battle begin!\n\n \n\nFew things to note:\n\n- Vote for the one you would rather play when given the option and with a sword at your neck. We are considering the quests in any player count.\n\n- The quests will be rated at Normal difficulty, no Nightmare or Easy modes.\n\n- Each quest is unique and should be loved, so there is no need to panic if your favourite quest is booted out of the brackets early in the tournament. You will probably have other favourites as well to cheer for.\n\n- If you haven't played either quest ever, and have no real preference, you can choose not to vote. This will keep the tournament fair for everyone.\n\n- No need for arguments, we're all friends here\n\n- The tournament will run for the entire month of December, with the winner being decided on the 31st of December.\n\n- Follow @DurinsFather on Twitter for updates and when to vote for the next tier. Or you can check the community via Discord, Facebook, and probably the FFG Forums as well.\n\n- I know that a Single Elimination game is dramatic, but there is nothing to be lost here. The bottom 30 quests aren't going to be banished forever, and the top quests won't dictate what the next cycle will look like. This is just for fun and adding more rounds would make it more tedious.\n\n- In order to vote, you must be signed in for Challonge, there was no way around this other than making a dozen polls. Signing in will allow you to participate in other large events like this in the future as well, so it may well be worth it. Only votes via this system will count, outside comments have no influence.\n\n\n \n\nTimes to vote:\n\nStage 1 - 26th of November until 23.59 CET on December 1st\n\nStage 2 - December 2nd until 23.59 CET December 7th\n\nStage 3 - December 8th until 23.59 CET December 13th\n\nStage 4 - December 14th until 23.59 CET December 19th\n\nStage 5 - December 20th until 23.59 CET December 25th\n\nSemifinals - December 26th until 23.59 CET December 28th\n\nFinals and loser finals - December 29th until the final seconds of 2018 (CET)\n\nTimes are in Central European Time, 6 hours ahead of EST, 1 ahead of GMT.\n\n \n\nWinner will be the first quest I play of 2019, so let's make this a fun one!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286791-favourite-quest-as-of-december-2018/?do=findComment&comment=3547334","commentId":3547334,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1543238266,"content":"Noticed that Helm's Deep is facing Steward's Fear.

We will see it next week in action against the victor of Voyage across Belegaer vs The Long Arm of Mordor.

Helm's Deep was my favourite 2016 (and how it turned out many others, too), but Steward's Fear didn't become the superior quest somehow for me so I guess I'll have to go for it again.\n\n \n\nIn the end my money is on \"The Crossing of Poros\" (as past winners don't tend to win twice in these championships).

Definitely one worth picking up, as is the case with most Nightmare packs of the first cycle, as those quests were a bit...odd. They were still trying to find a place and ended up being less enjoyable than others imo. Nightmare fixes that, and makes them a decent challenge with modern decks.\n\nI actually really like the quest, as I am more of a location control type of player, so I voted for it as well.

And those 5 are all well positioned for the next step, so we will probably have 62,5% of the field composed by scenario from the campaign. It is huge, even when considering they have 2 times more scenario than any other cycles. They are good scenario for the campaign (and I still support battle of the pelennor field to win this contest) but I don't feel like they all belong to the top of the competition like this.\n\nI got the feelings that many recent players of our game first come to the saga so the competition got a bias from people who want to vote from what they have played (and enjoyed of course) over scenario they might haven't played. I can be wrong of course, and even if I'm right this does not remove any credit to those scenario, to those people or to the competition itself. But I try to figure how 62,5% of the quarterfinal could be the LoTR campaign. And with a pretty solid domination on their numbers. In fact I expect the top 4 to be 100% from the campaign."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286791-favourite-quest-as-of-december-2018/?do=findComment&comment=3566804","commentId":3566804,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1544777752,"content":"Treachery of Rhudaur vs Flight of the Stormcaller is a bit of a heartbreaker; I really like both of those quests. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286791-favourite-quest-as-of-december-2018/?do=findComment&comment=3567881","commentId":3567881,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1544874714,"content":"Tricky matchup between Storm and Knife, two of my very favourite quests.

Took forever to take it out for the first time. Since then I have come to like it (somewhat). It caputures the atmosphere nicely and I always find myself debating if it is worth to play the ally or how to get as many actions out of my heroes *** possible.\n\nAlso a little surprised by the huge lead of Anduin over it's \"remake\". It is a classic for sure, but it didn't age all that well. Sure the remake can be \"cheesed\" by going for side quests, but I like a quest that gives good opportunities to play them. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286791-favourite-quest-as-of-december-2018/?do=findComment&comment=3571248","commentId":3571248,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1545245265,"content":"Update\n\nStage 4 has been closed, we are in the quarter finals at this point.\n\nI have noticed that a lot of Saga quests have managed to sneak through, but luckily some other quests have also managed to hang on up to now.\n\nMaybe in future tournaments the Saga's should be kept to their own separate bracket, maybe that will yield significant changes.\n\nVote now for the Quarter finals!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286791-favourite-quest-as-of-december-2018/?do=findComment&comment=3575393","commentId":3575393,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1545744499,"content":"We are nearing the end of the tournament, but it isn't all Saga quests from here on out.

So I guess Pelennor will take it this time, as past time winners tend to fall short in repeat entries (even when making it to the semi final again; quite showing for how good/beloved the quest is)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286791-favourite-quest-as-of-december-2018/?do=findComment&comment=3579154","commentId":3579154,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1546298912,"content":"Happy new year from mainland Europe.
