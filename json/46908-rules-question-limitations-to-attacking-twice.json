It's entirely possible that FFG didn't want to open a can of worms by allowing multiple attacks vs the same enemy with which you are engaged. Any cards coming in later sets that key off of the idea of  \"each time you attack an enemy or any enemies that have a special ability in the future that has something to do with \"each time this enemy is attacked\" could and would get crazy. I'm just guessing here but it seems like a good rule to maintain simplicity as best as possible. We all know how these customizable games get insanely complex after several releases.\n\nAs to your 2nd paragraph, I think it's the card \"Unexpected Courage\" that is the problem, not the guys. They knew what they were getting into when they made such a powerful card that would be an FAQ nightmare (don't get me wrong, I love UC).\n\nYour 4th paragraph raises an interesting point. Perhaps they wrote it that way because \"being engaged to an enemy\" is basically the only way you can really attack an enemy (barring exceptions). It really could be a loophole and that they really didn't intend for ANY enemy to EVER be attacked more than once. I suppose it's too late now. I'm curious (if) how the official FAQ is going to rule on this and some other situations as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46908-rules-question-limitations-to-attacking-twice/?do=findComment&comment=470062","commentId":470062,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1305643800,"content":"Vyron said:\n\n \n\nI read the rulebook like this: \"with which they are engaged\" not to permit legolas and dunhere to attack twice, but to clarify that you can only attack enemies, with which you are engaged and not enemies in the staging area. that's the more \"common sense\" way - why would they be allowed to attack twice, their abilites already granting them some heavy rules bending? no reason... therefore --> attack only once...\n\n\n\nYep, that pretty much sums up how I feel about it"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46908-rules-question-limitations-to-attacking-twice/?do=findComment&comment=470069","commentId":470069,"userName":"Casamyr","timestamp":1305644493,"content":"How about this one.

I know of several occasions where virtually the entire community agreed on what the intent of a card was... only to have the official ruling go in a completely different way. The only concrete information we have at this time is the rulebook and the cards themselves. I agree that the \"intent\" may have been to only allow an enemy to be attacked once, but if I'm running a tournament I don't feel the rulebook or the cards clearly supports that ruling.\n\nI do not agree that it is logical nor that is is it a fact that a character may attack only once. At no point is that stated (or even implied) in the rulebook. You may only declare an attack against an engaged enemy once per round and you must exhaust characters to do so. However, if you were able to somehow ready a character after an attack, there is nothing to indicate you couldn't then use that character to attack a different engaged enemy. The only limitation on which characters can participate in an attack is that they must be eligible (i.e. Ready, and potentially requiring card text or a keyword) .Therefore, \"attack only once\" isn't a rule and shouldn't be applied to this situation.\n\n \n\nHow about this one. I attack Ungoliant's Spawn with all my characters leaving it with one hit point, I then play A Light in the Dark and throw UG back into the staging area, ready Dunhere with UC and then attack UG in the staging area dealing one point of damaging and killing the beastie.\n\nI am not longer engaged with Ungoliant's spawn so do the rules stating you can only attack a creature engaged with you once still apply?\n\n \n\nSounds like a perfectly legal play to me.\n\nI think that these situations clearly call for a FAQ entry since there are several ways this could be ruled:\n\n1. Each character may only be declared as an attacker once per round. (Vyron's suggestion)\n\n2. Each enemy, regardless of their state (Engaged to you or an opponent or in the staging area), may only be the target of an attack once per round. So, if you have Ranged and another player declares an attack against one of the enemies he is engaged with you had better use the Ranged character since you won't have an opportunity to use him later yourself against the same enemy.\n\n3. No limit on number of attacks per character or per enemy other than the one stated in the rulebook: Each enemy may only be attacked once by the player it is engaged with. If two other players have character with Ranged, they can each use that character to declare an attack against the enemy on their respective turns. Dunhere can attack enemies in the staging area as many times as he can be readied.\n\nI'm personally pulling for option 3 since I feel both options 1 and 2 are too restrictive from a design perspective.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46908-rules-question-limitations-to-attacking-twice/?do=findComment&comment=470653","commentId":470653,"userName":"Vyron2","timestamp":1305716102,"content":"Brad Harrington said:\n\nIf Dunhere has Unexpected Courage attached to him can he attack the SAME enemy twice if it's in the staging area?\n\nPage 20 of the rulebook states:\n\n\"Each player can declare an attack (with any number of eligible attackers he controls) against each enemy with which he is engaged once each round.\"\n\nI guess the question is, does the limit of one attack only apply to enemies you are engaged with?\n\nA similar issue aries with Legolas in a multiplayer game is he ends up with Unexpected Courage.
