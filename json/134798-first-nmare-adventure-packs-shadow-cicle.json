The basic idea behind the new infinite looks to involve recycling events with the tomes from Against the Shadow during planning and then ending the loop with a copy of Follow Me! so that the next player can do the same. Actual resource generation is happening thanks to the use of A Very Good Tale + replaying Durin's Song (which also provides as much questing as needed), and the tomes get recycled by Second Breakfast. They don't go through all the steps of the loop, but it sounds complex and like it may not work well in solo."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134798-first-nmare-adventure-packs-shadow-cicle/?do=findComment&comment=1447849","commentId":1447849,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1423846176,"content":"Follow Me! require to play multiplayer.\n\nWell, this is not the topic to discuss it.
