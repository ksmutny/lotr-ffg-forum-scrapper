Is there anyone going to GenCon that has their 1-3 PM slot open on Friday and would be willing to pick up a ticket for the LotR event, CGM1238188.  (The slow that starts at 1 PM and ends at 3:00 PM)\n\nI would love to attend the event, however there are only 2 tickets left and my friends and I have a conflicting event scheduled for that slow (Scheduled before the LotR event was posted).\n\nI called customer service at GenCon events and was told the only option I had available was to get someone else to buy a ticket and give it to me. They told me there is no way to cancel the event I have now, and that if I waited until the show started the event would be sold out.\n\nIf someone does have the time available and would be willing to grab me a ticket, I could meet up at the event and compensate you for the cost of the event.\n\nThanks,\n\nRyan\n\n "}]}
