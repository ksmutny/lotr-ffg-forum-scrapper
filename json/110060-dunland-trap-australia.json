Everyone else is already playing this quest and im still waiting cause overseas shipping is an extra $35 - $50 cost for any quick delivery and anything cheaper will take at least 2 or 3 weeks to get here at which point it should hopefully be out here anyway...\n\nHas anyone in Australia seen this anywhere at all or know anywhere online I can buy it and not get charged like 40 or 50 bucks extra for delivery just to get it express/sooner than a week and a half away?\n\nEdited July 4, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110060-dunland-trap-australia/?do=findComment&comment=1143030","commentId":1143030,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1404449233,"content":"I am Australian and order the packs from overseas. BookDepositary is pretty cheap as they factor the shipping into the base , but as it is so cheap they run out of stock fast.\n\nWe pay 20 ish a pack. You can get individual packs sent from LotasVault to Australia for like 1 or 2 dollars. They get zero day stock and have fast postage. If you order in bulk, I get lotr, and, CoC and WI at same time as shipping is combined you end up paying nearly 5 bucks cheaper per pack.\n\nMiniature Market CoolStuff funagain also are good, and the truth is shipping from these international sites is usually cheaper, or only marginally more expensive."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110060-dunland-trap-australia/?do=findComment&comment=1143060","commentId":1143060,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1404451840,"content":"Book Depository have it for like $15 dollars.... with free international shipping, it ships the day after purchase and it only takes 5-8 business days to Australia....... that is just insane.... how are they even able to offer it that cheap..? compared to FFG who need $46 dollars from me for postage alone? bizzare.... I just ordered it, hope it all works out as it says it will....\n\nÂ \n\nminituare market wants $42 just for postage and lotus vault want like $46, **** both of them!
