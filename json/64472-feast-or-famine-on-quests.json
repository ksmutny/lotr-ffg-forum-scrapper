So, I encourage you to stick it out, wait for more cards (especially player cards), try different strategies and most importantly enjoy adventuring in such a beautifully illustrated game! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Best wishes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64472-feast-or-famine-on-quests/?do=findComment&comment=630364","commentId":630364,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1336876614,"content":"Your deck sounds like Willpower and Location Hate centered.

Location heavy quests like Emyn Muil will become slightly harder, while combat heavy quests will become slightly easier.  As a main rule, after you create a deck, play Anduin Journey and aim to have good results in this quest. To beat it, your deck must be balanced because you encounter both locations and enemies, plus you need some threat management. For me, this is perfect quest for early playtesting.\n\nAnd finally, you can read session reports or strategy guides that tell you how to deal with every quest.

The last game I played of it was when I beat it with Boromir on round 1, that had never happened to me before on any quest.\n\nThe Long Dark really fits the tiles of this thread. I can imagine losing it silly when I get some nastiness early but so for I have beaten it both times I played it without much problem, even though on the second atempt I lost Dúnhere on round one due to the Rock Adder, that really is a nasty enemy - with all the shadow effects boosting attack considerably."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64472-feast-or-famine-on-quests/?do=findComment&comment=637173","commentId":637173,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1338271839,"content":"Boromir is quite the worker with the shovel."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64472-feast-or-famine-on-quests/?do=findComment&comment=637174","commentId":637174,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1338272276,"content":"muemakan said:\n\nBoromir is quite the worker with the shovel.\n\n\n\nYes. Haha. I can imagine Denethor had him fill all the coal cellars in the City when he was a child.\n\nAnd Elfhelm is quite a stud in the Mineshaft. Too bad I cannot really utilize him in a deck. Have others done? He seems too situational for me, even though when he first appeared I felt he'd be great against all the Doomed, certainly better solo I believe."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64472-feast-or-famine-on-quests/?do=findComment&comment=637215","commentId":637215,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1338279885,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\nAnd Elfhelm is quite a stud in the Mineshaft.\n\n\n\nDo you mean using Elfhelm to clear the Zigil Mineshaft without gaining threat? It's debatable whether this is legal. Consensus here [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/807187/zigil-mineshaft-and-elfhelm] was that it isn't, the point being that Elfhelm deals with threat that comes from an encounter/quest card effect, but the ZM threat gain is a cost (not an effect)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64472-feast-or-famine-on-quests/?do=findComment&comment=637222","commentId":637222,"userName":"gvaughn1","timestamp":1338280898,"content":" Well, Redhorn Gate kicked my ass. :-)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64472-feast-or-famine-on-quests/?do=findComment&comment=637252","commentId":637252,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1338287453,"content":"Hmm, I read elsewhere that it was legal.
