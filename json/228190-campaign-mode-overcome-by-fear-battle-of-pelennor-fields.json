During the Paths of the Dead scenario, I ended with Overcome by Fear attached to my dial, because we quested past the Stone of Erech, which is the victory condition for the scenario, but unfortunately, a treachery reattached Overcome By Fear. Therefore, I did not get to the end of the round to fulfill the trigger for the Action to remove it.\n\n \n\n2. On the Siege of Gondor scenario, it took us 9 turns to complete it. This meant that during the Battle of Pelennor fields, Aragorn will take 9 turns to arrive. I did end WITHOUT Overcome by Fear attached to my dial, but there is no specific instruction to remove it from the campaign pool if it is not attached.\n\n \n\n3. Because my starting threat is 33 (via an unfortunate circumstance with my friend's utter annihilation earlier in the campaign), Overcome by Fear means I literally cannot survive the 9 turns required for Aragorn to arrive.\n\n \n\nMy questions are as follows:\n\n \n\n1. Did I miss my opportunity to remove Overcome by Fear during the Paths of the Dead? Is there a brief \"End of the Round\" when we win the scenario in which I could have triggered the action?\n\n \n\n2. If I completed Siege of Gondor without Overcome by Fear in play, does it return to the Campaign Pool?\n\n \n\n3. Is it necessary for Aragorn to arrive in order to defeat the Battle of Pelennor Fields scenario?\n\n \n\nThanks guys, stuck in a very frustrating situation, and hoping for some clarity about exactly how screwed I am."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228190-campaign-mode-overcome-by-fear-battle-of-pelennor-fields/?do=findComment&comment=2376875","commentId":2376875,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1471748078,"content":"Huh, that's... hmm.
