It is similar to the scenario kits released for The Woodland Realm, The Wizard's Quest, Escape From Khazad-Dum, and The Mines of Moria (which also did not contain any player cards) over the last two years, except this one does not appear to be designed for competitive play as those scenario kits were.\n\nIt does, however, allow for Epic Multiplayer Mode with large groups (like Siege of Annuminas), if you're into that kind of thing. \n\nI hope it scales as well for solo as it does for multiplayer, but I guess we'll have to wait and see.\n\nEdited September 22 by TwiceBorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311373-the-hunt-for-the-dreadnaught/?do=findComment&comment=3991830","commentId":3991830,"userName":"BillK62","timestamp":1600780633,"content":"I wonder how many of the cards will be reprints of already existing cards, and how many will be original.

If your threat is near the threat limit and you fail to quest successfully and net threat gain will put you at threat limit + 10 or more (60 or more if threat limit is 50, 55 or more if threat limit is 45 for one ring, etc) does the contract trigger at 50 (effectively stopping the rest of the threat) and then place you at 40 or does all the threat get added first and after the -10 from flipping the contract, you still lose the game because you are at or above the threat limit?\n\n2)Side A says threat can't be reduced from Player card effects. So are we talking all Heroes (like Le Frodo and Galadriel), all Allys, all Attachments, and all Events (like The Shirefolk) can't be used to lower threat? How does the current Setup ruling affect Ta Eowyn since she has Setup threat reduction. I am assuming Folco will still start with lower threat if you play a group of Hobbits.\n\nI would like to try this contract with a low threat group of hobbits.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311373-the-hunt-for-the-dreadnaught/?do=findComment&comment=4032179","commentId":4032179,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1608473489,"content":"Got my copy last week and decided to put my thoughts on it in an article. Here you go: https://visionofthepalantir.com/2020/12/20/first-impressions-the-hunt-for-the-dreadnaught/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2020/12/20/first-impressions-the-hunt-for-the-dreadnaught/]\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with the quest, and feel that it is also quite new-player friendly compared to the other POD stuff. The quality of the cards is a lot better than the other POD products, and the fact that Caleb snuck in a contract at all is worth praise. \nI have also played a 13-player game this weekend where we took on the Dreadnaught across 4 tables.
