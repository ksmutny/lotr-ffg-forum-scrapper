(It's kind of the immune location question in reverse).   "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264796-legolas-and-explore-the-island/?do=findComment&comment=3112599","commentId":3112599,"userName":"Emilius","timestamp":1512585353,"content":"Yes, you can add progress on the active location, but not on the quest card"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264796-legolas-and-explore-the-island/?do=findComment&comment=3112612","commentId":3112612,"userName":"Boromore","timestamp":1512585634,"content":"I'm happy with that answer!
