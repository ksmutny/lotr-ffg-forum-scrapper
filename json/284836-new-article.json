I had to enlarge the original art by Magali Villeneuve somewhat and also included the flavour text from the treasure cards. The only thing I am missing is the collection icons from Wilds of Rhovanion and its cycle.\n\nWhile I think Orcrist looks really great, the colours for Glamdring do not really fit: orange and green. It would look better as a leadership, tactics or neutral card.\n\n \n\nOrcrist-Front-Face.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_10/Orcrist-Front-Face.jpg.e93f4984d7550f62c7b64bc652087070.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_10/Orcrist-Front-Face.jpg.e93f4984d7550f62c7b64bc652087070.jpg]\n\nGlamdring-Front-Face.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_10/Glamdring-Front-Face.jpg.1ebbd433c346b8c3bd5012dd8cd8d554.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_10/Glamdring-Front-Face.jpg.1ebbd433c346b8c3bd5012dd8cd8d554.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284836-new-article/?do=findComment&comment=3512269","commentId":3512269,"userName":"Gandalf_","timestamp":1540309037,"content":"These look great!

Nice work!"}]}
