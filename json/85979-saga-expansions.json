We will defiantly see some major plot lines from the books in them, but they are not going to be telling the story of the books. They are just set in the books and focus on a \"part\" of the book. For example The Battle of Helms Deep would make a great Saga expansion. An entire series that just tells this one battle, 6 interconnected quests. Stuff like that... or we could see a Saga Expantion on Fairimer defending Henneth Annûn for example... something only mentioned in the books.\n\n \n\nI think that the Saga expansions are what this game should always have been. When most people talk to me about this game what they are looking for is a quest orientated game dripping in theme. The Saga expansions seam to be FFG trying to pull the game back towards this by allowing special rules that esist only for that expansion, allowing them to make much more interesting and thematic quests as they are not bound by the general rules of the main game.\n\n \n\nAs for how many?

They're obviously going to cover the entirety of The Lord of the rings, how they do this we'll just have to wait and find out. I do like the idea of Samwise's idea of a Gandalf hero that would be used when not on a frodo quest....

He'd be in everyones deck! Using 1 sphere, 2 spheres, 3 spheres, all 4 spheres? no problem! Throw a steward of gondor on the wizard and you can pay for anything regardless of what other heroes you're using.  It would be a game designer's nightmare.  Plus all of your friends would be PO'd that either 1) they cant run their gandalf deck or 2) they cant run their gandalf allies\n\nEdited August 15, 2013 by Pharmboys2013"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=840300","commentId":840300,"userName":"Troymk1","timestamp":1376539859,"content":"Well I surmise that yes, he would be rather powerful\n\n \n\nHis threat level would probably be up near 20 to be honest  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nOff the cuff he may well be a neutral hero.

(edit: I happen to hope that non-frodo/ring bearer parts however, don't get a bonus hero at all - bonus Gandalf the white might work, but I'd rather use regular Aragorn thanks all the same)\n\nThe only real question for me is; will they release everything in a linear order or will they choose another thematic order?\n\n \n\n(For instance, they could release all the frodo parts first, then go back and fill in the rest, or they may approach the releases in order of the books more obviously).\n\nI think They're definitely going to follow the books to begin with Booored so I don't think you're going to get what you want (bits exploring underused topics such as Faramir and the rangers) until some time in the future.\n\nI think they'll eventually release everything though. I do hope we eventually get parts that have currently been missed (the old forest, barrow downs and the elves of mirkwood sections for instance).\n\nI do however think that making only 6 saga expansions (18 quests) out of the lord of the rings would be like saying, hey lets not use all the source material and therefore make less money. It's pretty guaranteed that every saga expansion will sell.\n\nIt's just a case of asking what order they do them in, not how many. With all the side bits and bits that can inspire without directly occurring in the books, there's easily 100 + quests in the whole of the lord of the rings, and many hundreds if they get to count the appendix. \n\nBasically I think we'll be getting saga expansions for Lord of the Rings (and possibly one to give us the missing hobbit sections, I recon 3 more quests would complete the hobbit anyhow, it's very short), up until they get rights to a new book (Silmarilian, maybe the new children of hurin, unfinished tales perhaps).\n\nWhich isn't to say that the other expansions should cease, the deluxe expansions and original stories (especially the stewards fear; which is just made up but definitely a good story for the world) have a place in this game also. I think that adventure cycles will be phased out eventually though - as far as quest design goes I think they're much more limited in what they can do (adding only 1 additional deck to ones released in the last deluxe expansion each time I mean).\n\nEdited August 15, 2013 by Rapier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85979-saga-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=841200","commentId":841200,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1376602856,"content":"> The Saga Expansions are not meant to be \"the books\" or w/e. We will defiantly see some major plot lines from the books in them, but they are not going to be telling the story of the books. They are just set in the books and focus on a \"part\" of the book. For example The Battle of Helms Deep would make a great Saga expansion. An entire series that just tells this one battle, 6 interconnected quests. Stuff like that... or we could see a Saga Expantion on Fairimer defending Henneth Annûn for example... something only mentioned in the books.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I agree with Rapier about tou on this, I don't think that's exactly what the Sagas are about, although I think we may see, for example, a Siege of Gondor saga expansion or even one for every battle but that's that. \n> \n>  \n> \n> I think that the Saga expansions are what this game should always have been. When most people talk to me about this game what they are looking for is a quest orientated game dripping in theme. The Saga expansions seam to be FFG trying to pull the game back towards this by allowing special rules that esist only for that expansion, allowing them to make much more interesting and thematic quests as they are not bound by the general rules of the main game.\n> \n>  \n> \n> However, I totally agree with this. Alternate untold storylines is incredibly cool I agre, but they should not be entirely the main focus of this game.\n> \n>  \n> \n> As for how many?
