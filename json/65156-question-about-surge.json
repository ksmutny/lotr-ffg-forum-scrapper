Does Thalin's ability kill that enemy BEFORE \"Surge\" takes effect? My thought would be \"yes he does kill the enemy and no additional card is revealed\". I hope I am right.\n\nThanks!! (HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY FOR ALL WHO SERVE AND TO ALL THAT HAVE SERVED IN THE PAST, THANK YOU!!)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65156-question-about-surge/?do=findComment&comment=636723","commentId":636723,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1338160893,"content":" Yep.  In fact, this is addressed specifically in the FAQ.

Just realized that our two-player Hunt for Gollum last night was much harder than it ought to as we let the Surge effect of the Eastern Crows (www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/eastern-crows-core [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/eastern-crows-core]) preceed that of Thalin questing power and as they shuffles back into the Encounter deck this happened often.\n\nWell, thanks for clearing that up. Must read through the FAQ more often."}]}
