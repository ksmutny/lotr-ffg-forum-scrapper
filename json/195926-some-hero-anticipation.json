I think we are going to see at least one in the announcement, though it was not so last time if I remember correctly.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, what are your guesses about the second hero in the Grey Havens? I feel the safe bet is Noldor: Khazad, Heirs, Voice, Realm, they all had two heroes of the same trait, belonging to the area. But how about the sphere? Well, it is not going to be Spirit and it will most likely not be Leadership because it was already announced we are getting a Leadership hero in the first pack, and also Leadership doesn't feel right for Noldor, though they do have Elrohir hero and Galadriel ally, together with the Scout of Imladris, I believe. My personal guess is then Tactics rather than Lore because we have recently got Erestor, and it would be great to see another Tactics Elf. After all, Elven Spear falls into the category, and there is a picture of Revealed in Wrath which is clearly a Noldor (Glorfindel) theme card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936634","commentId":1936634,"userName":"wolframius","timestamp":1450173766,"content":"Flame of the west is Return of the King part 1, right?\n\n \n\nI don't know for that, but I bet my money that in the last Saga box we will have Tactics Eowyn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936635","commentId":1936635,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1450173831,"content":"Saruman."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936689","commentId":1936689,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1450177289,"content":"Tactics Imrahil "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936700","commentId":1936700,"userName":"13edl@m","timestamp":1450177774,"content":"The tradition throughout deluxe expansions since Khazad-dum has been to include a tactics hero.  Aside from Glorfindel I don't know that there are many named Noldor characters in middle earth at this period that would naturally fall into a tactic role.

My guess:\n\nAragorn: He will be a hero in this box.

He would be one of my final guesses if not for two or three other characters. I also believe we will stay with one tactics hobbir hero forever.\n\nBeregond: Woudn't be to surprised if we get him, but what other role than a super Defender could he fill?\n\nEowyn : Here we go . I will bet on her tactics inarnation. There is just no better moment to introduce this than this battle. The death of the witch-king deserves a hero to replay it again and again. Extra Points: This is the only part of the books where Eowyn fights (she is wounded and can't participate in the battle at the black gate)\n\nEomer: An other of my favorite guesses. his would be his Leadership Version, but this might be even better for the last Expansion, after Théoden is dead, I don't know and Théoden dies \"during\" this box. Overall I think Eowyn is the safer bet and two Rohan heroes in Gondor's greatest battle? Would be strange, but on the other Hand Rohan pretty much saves the City at the last moment.\n\nFaramir: He could become a tactics hero, but is wounded for most of the remaining storyline, but still possible.\n\nDenethor: I would put him above Eomer. We only have his lore hero and a pretty old Leadership ally. So a Spirit or Leadership hero does seem to fit the Expansion quite well. I would imagine a \"drawback hero\" like Grima or Spiritfindel. Maybe he could boost our allies, just to become mad and make them flee (=Shuffle into deck/discard them)? Or he could have very strong stats which unstopable go down every round until he kills himself (showing how the once strong leader gets mad and suicides)? I think you could do cool Things with him.\n\n \n\nTo the conclusion:\n\n1. Aragorn (Fellowship)\n\n2. Eowyn (Tactics)\n\n3. Denethor (Spirit/Leadership)\n\n \n\nThis Trio has one of the great heroes of the story (Aragorn) who can participate in every quest of the box as he takes part in every Event in the first part of the book. Eowyn kills the witch-king and is an iconic character, there won't be a better moment to publish a tactics verson of her (now or never). Finally Denethor (I prefer a Spirit Version, but Leadership is an Option)  doesn't do all that much in the books (or movie :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]), but I would put him on the same Level of relevenz as treebeard (and he became a hero too). This way we have \"1 of everything\": Aragorn from the first book/the Fellowship, Eowyn second book/Rohan and Denethor third book/Gondor. This would represent the \"teameffort\" it took to hold Minas Tirith.\n\nEdited December 15, 2015 by Calvadur"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936859","commentId":1936859,"userName":"Piratelli","timestamp":1450186497,"content":"Gandalf unlikely?\n\n \n\nFor me it would be the perfect time for us to see the might Gandalf the White!\n\n \n\nvery excited about that"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936866","commentId":1936866,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1450186793,"content":"> Flame of the west is Return of the King part 1, right?\n> \n>  \n> \n> I don't know for that, but I bet my money that in the last Saga box we will have Tactics Eowyn.\n\nYes, FotW is saga no. 5.\n\n \n\nAs much as it makes sense to include her, there are some indications that make me think otherwise: the fact she is in the core set, and the designers might prefer to give those who only follow saga a new hero, and also (to a much lesser degree) Herugrim that helps Rohan heroes gain attack strength through willpower."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936867","commentId":1936867,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1450186823,"content":"> Saruman.\n\nOr John the Troll?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936871","commentId":1936871,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1450187151,"content":"> Looking trough the chapters of Rotk Part 1 some events are prety eyecatching:\n> \n> 1.

I am inclined to believe the designers look more for theme than mechanics when they choose their saga characters. So although I agree it might be hard to create a new Beregond, I think his role in the book is substantial enough to grant a saga character. I am guessing an ally, but I would not be surprised by a hero version (after all, his part is much greater than Damrod's).\n\nÉomer is a given hero bet.\n\nImrahil surely a character: probably a hero too.\n\nÉowyn and Denethor, based on the above \"logic\" of mine, I think allies.\n\nAnd I am hoping for ally versions of Merry and Pippin. I keep repeating this but perhaps they could gain the Rohan and Gondor traits, respectively.\n\n \n\nAnd spheres are always intriguing, and harder to guess than names.\n\nEdited December 15, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936925","commentId":1936925,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1450189810,"content":"There's one version of a hero missing : spirit Aragorn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1936977","commentId":1936977,"userName":"Finduin","timestamp":1450191161,"content":"Do not forget that the Saga Expansions give us 4 uniques allies (one from each sphere), so is possible to see Beregond, or Imrahil as allies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1937053","commentId":1937053,"userName":"wehehe","timestamp":1450193115,"content":"This is an interesting topic.\n\n \n\nI bet that Aragorn will get it's spirit version in the last saga box.

What always should be remembered is that Saga expansions are also designed with the players in mind who only own the core set.  For that reason we got no new Legolas/Gimli heroes and I assume for that reason we will not get another Eowyn or Denethor.\n\n \n\nPersonally I like this approach as I think that the CS+Saga crows should have a decent pool of heroes to choose from. I would have loved it if they had continued with the 4 heroes each expansion approach. In that case we would have had the room for another Gimli/Legolas or Tactics Eowyn. As it is I support the approach that we get no hero duplicates inside this “cycle”. Those of us who post here for the most part pick up each expansion or AP, so we will eventually get our Lore Legolas or Tactics Eowyn.\n\n \n\nSo let’s get on with the speculation. So far we have had 1 neutral, 3 lore, 2 spirit, 2 leadership and 1 tactics hero in the saga expansions. That should leave us with one spirit, one leadership and two tactics heroes to come (and a decent pool of 6 heroes each sphere to choose from).\n\n \n\nTo be honest a lot of time has passed since I have read the books, so this are rather guesses for the most part. What I remember is that a lot of new characters were introduced in book three but nobody in the Frodo/Sam part. Therefore I assume we will have another spill over to box number 6 (like we had with box 3 and 4).\n\n \n\nI think an Eomer hero is a pretty safe bet at this point, probably leadership. I guess thematically it would make sense to put him into the last box then, but then again he is probably one the most important “supporting characters” so to speak, so I do not think that they will hold him back that long.\n\n \n\nMy second guess would be Tactics Imrahil. I think the original Tactics Beregond would have been perfect here, but I cannot imagine them doing heroes twice in the same sphere. We should definitely get a Tactics heroes and with Eowyn out of the picture he makes the most sense to me.\n\n \n\nWith Hallbarad, Elladan, Elrohir, Merry, Pippin, Bergil, Eowyn, Beregond we have quite a strong line-up for potential line-up. I think they will try to strike a balance between characters not yet represented and those we already have as heroes.  \n\nDenethor isn’t really a hero in the book, so I guess we might get him as an objective ally like Golem. We already have a strong ally and hero version of Faramir. So I cannot see another one.\n\n \n\nI would love to have the twins, but I cannot see them making the cut – especially since we get their ally version in the new cycle.\n\n \n\nSo my most likely candidates for allies are Hallbarad, Beregond, Eowyn and Bergil.\n\n \n\nBox 6 should also be a head scratcher. Maybe a spirit Golem (already thought that we might get him in box 3), but can/should they really pull it off. I guess we might see Merry and Pippin allies (spill-over) but apart from that I have no clue.\n\nEdited December 15, 2015 by RebelX"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195926-some-hero-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=1937622","commentId":1937622,"userName":"RebelX","timestamp":1450204250,"content":"> For Flame of the West, I think Imrahil and Eomer are probably the most likely heroes, but I could maybe see Leadership Beregond being a thing?
