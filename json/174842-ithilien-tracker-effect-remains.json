And probably no effect then, which is tough on the tracker. However, most of the immune enemies do not enter during staging, right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174842-ithilien-tracker-effect-remains/?do=findComment&comment=2503409","commentId":2503409,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1479289259,"content":"Mostly they don't, but Morgul Wraith from Land of Shadow lives in the encounter deck and is immune when the Ring is exhausted. There are also some immune enemies that don't start in the encounter deck but can end up in the discard pile, such as the Witch-King from Black Riders. Finally, some enemies can enter the staging area through card effect during questing (Naurlug) or by advancing the quest mid-way through staging (rare, but can be done)."}]}
