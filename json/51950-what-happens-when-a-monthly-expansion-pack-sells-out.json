When the LotR Core Set sold out it was reprinted extremely fast. For other games reprinting might take from half a year to a year (or more). If FFG takes the opportunity to update/correct cards when reprinting it might cause further delay."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51950-what-happens-when-a-monthly-expansion-pack-sells-out/?do=findComment&comment=518605","commentId":518605,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1314070631,"content":"whereabouts in Uk? the shop in Nottingham where I get my FFG cards had a couple of copies of Hunt for Gollum in last week."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51950-what-happens-when-a-monthly-expansion-pack-sells-out/?do=findComment&comment=518735","commentId":518735,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1314093375,"content":"im up north- dont think ive got a store in about 200miles"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51950-what-happens-when-a-monthly-expansion-pack-sells-out/?do=findComment&comment=518881","commentId":518881,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1314111967,"content":" the Upcoming page shows that Carrock is being reprinted with a September delivery date."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51950-what-happens-when-a-monthly-expansion-pack-sells-out/?do=findComment&comment=518969","commentId":518969,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1314124169,"content":" The core game and both the first two adventure packs are still in stock at CCG Armory right now.
