We have really struggled with A Return to Mirkwood and have just managed our first victory. We mostly struggle with the threat - the killer being the raise of 4 each round for the player guarding Gollum ( +1 for normal end of round threat raise and +3 for player guarding Gollum.) I was just wondering - are we doing this right? Is the intention that the player guarding Gollum raises his threat by 4 (1+3) or does it mean instead of raising your threat in the refresh phase by 1, you just raise your threat by 3 if you are guarding Gollum?."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59642-return-to-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=585928","commentId":585928,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1327706012,"content":"Â It is by 4, that's why it is good to switch back and forth when you can."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59642-return-to-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=586015","commentId":586015,"userName":"Pudsey","timestamp":1327725882,"content":"OK - Thanks for the quick reply."}]}
