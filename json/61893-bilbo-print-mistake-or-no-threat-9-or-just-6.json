So all the heroes in the core set verify this theory. Bilbo do not. HIs threat cost is 9 instead of 6. I want to now for sure is not a mistake. If it is a printing mistake I want to change this.

I think Bilbo's threat being 9 was meant to balance out his ability, though perhaps to an extreme that makes him a little overpriced threat wise."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61893-bilbo-print-mistake-or-no-threat-9-or-just-6/?do=findComment&comment=606102","commentId":606102,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1331825991,"content":"coupled with protector of lorien bilbo is amazingly powerful hero- and worth every point of that threat"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61893-bilbo-print-mistake-or-no-threat-9-or-just-6/?do=findComment&comment=606103","commentId":606103,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1331826223,"content":" Right, and his ability makes Protector of Lorien even more viable with more cards to discard.

IIRC the low threat compared to other heroes, not follwoing the WP+AT+DF+HP formula, being one of his major advantages."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61893-bilbo-print-mistake-or-no-threat-9-or-just-6/?do=findComment&comment=606123","commentId":606123,"userName":"terry2k2","timestamp":1331829688,"content":"Thank you all for the answers. I am only an amateur and I want to discuss about the card becouse I like very much the game and I want to play it well. It was not an official state by ffg that the attck + defense + willpower + hitpoints, I found it somewhere else. I don't remember the site or forum, but I search again and hopefuly find and post it again.\n\nThanks very much again\n\nGreetings.
