Do you want a all purpose deck? Because this isn't possible, nor is it how the game is designed imo. I think making full Cycle decks is very possible, and maybe, when the card pool is huge you will be able to build decks for everything.. but trying to make a single deck with no tweaks that can defeat every quest released is not really likely.\n\nI am currently working on a Shadows of Mirkwood solo deck. It still needs some tweaking.. I am finding it hard to get a decent win ration on Journey and Return. The rest of the quests can be beaten, but getting the deck to beat Return breaks Journey and visa versa... as those quest have some VERY strict requirements. Especially in solo mode.. return is brutal in solo. Still I am confident I will get a CYCLE Deck out soon that I can post...\n\nand I think this might be what you are after.. Decks for cycles... not for the entire game.. I really do not think that is every going to be possible.. not unless power creep after a few years makes the original quests completely trivial, and if that happens what is the point. I also think thematically it is fun to make cycle decks, as in a way it is all a single quest.\n\nEither way I am also very interested in other peoples cycle decks if they want to post.. I'll post mine soon.\n\nAs for cards that are a MUST have in any deck.... I think this is pretty hard as well, as there are cards that should be in every deck of a certain type, but in every deck no matter what?\n\nWell for solo, I like a Heavy Spirit/Lore with a leadership splash (experimenting with a 4 sphere deck at the mo and it is surprisingly crushing, I am currently playing Return with it and needed a quick break as it was so stressful!!) Still in all my solo decks I ALWAYS have...\n\nGreeting, Steward, Sneak Attack, Tomb, Gandalf, Minstrel, UC - Leadership Song, I also use multi songs, so each hero gets a song eventually for every type, so you end up with 3 resources of each type for each mana colour you use. BUT, this is experimental, but I ALWAYS have leader song and steward.\n\nI do not think a solo deck can function with out these cards, at least how i build them anyway.\n\nAs for my 1 hero? um... .. Elenore I think. Elenore makes any deck good, but Frodo is also beyond amazing I normally always have both these guys. Elenore makes there a zero fear of treacherys. You need to know what ones to let though as the surge efefct can screw you with her, but when you play a quest that can kill you with treachery cards.. well.. the quest just can't. Also frodo... this guy is the wall of all walls.. never will you die unless you die of 50 threat. Having frodo frees you to take more risks, as you know you can survive."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58802-one-deck-to-rule-them-all-post-your-cannot-quest-without-cards/?do=findComment&comment=577944","commentId":577944,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1326272520,"content":"I agree, it is not really possible to make one all purpose deck.

Play a stalling strategy against any non-Rhosgobel quest. You know the card that is coming? Fine, shoot for willpower-threat parity and never mind if winning takes you a copuple dozen turns.\n\n2. Play Lore (and since you need to rush against Rhosgobel and Lore of Imladris is a Lore card, that greatly helps there)\n\n(3.

The most important effect when playing solo (single deck) is knowing what the encounter deck is about to throw at you.
