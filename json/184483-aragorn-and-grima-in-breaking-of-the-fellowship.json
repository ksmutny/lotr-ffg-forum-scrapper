At the end of the quest, my only remaining heroes are Aragorn and Grima. (Maybe the third hero was pitched to the Balrog in the last quest, or maybe she has Fallen into Evil or something).\n\n \n\nWho becomes the captive for the next quest? I can't pick Aragorn, because he'll become Fellowship Aragorn in the next quest. I can't pick Grima, because you're not allowed to use Grima in the Treason of Saruman quests.\n\n \n\nThoughts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184483-aragorn-and-grima-in-breaking-of-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1726259","commentId":1726259,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1438996198,"content":"I'm thinking you have to take a +1 threat penalty and add a hero so he/she can be the captive in the next quest.

There is a question on the forums about captives in the saga campaign mode and nobody's been able to think of a really satisfactory answer. If you finish Breaking of the Fellowship and the only heroes you control are Aragorn and the Ring-bearer (say, in a secrecy Aragorn-only deck, or if your other heroes have died), who becomes the captive? And how do you set up the next game of The Uruk-hai? Thank you very much for your help!\"\n\n \n\nAnd got this answer:\n\n\"If you’re only remaining heroes are Aragorn and the Ring-bearer, then you would not choose a captive at the end of Breaking of the Fellowship because you have no legal choice. When setting up The Uruk-hai, follow the instructions and choose a captive from your available heroes. Since you have no previous captive, you ignore the parenthetical. \n\nCheers,\nCaleb\"\n\n \n\nAnd later I remembered that we wanted to know about Grima as well, so I sent: \n\n \n\n\"Hi, This is a follow-up to a rules question I sent yesterday about choosing a captive after finishing Breaking of the Fellowship in campaign mode. What happens if Grima is the only legal target for becoming the captive when you finish the game? Thanks again!\"\n\n \n\nAnd got this reply:\n\n \n\n\"Grima will remain the captive for The Uruk-hai scenario, and your heroes will be very disappointed to learn that they raced across Rohan in an effort to rescue a double-agent who attacks them at Isengard!\n\nCheers,\nCaleb\"\n\n \n\nAfter that answer I wanted a bit more information so I replied with:\n\n \n\n\"Thanks for your answers.  About Grima as captive -- does this remain true even though the Treason of Saruman rules insert states: \"When playing the scenarios in The Treason of Saruman, the players cannot use any ally or hero card with the title 'Saruman' or 'Gríma.'\"\n\n \n\nAnd got this reply:  \n\n \n\n\"There are 3 ways you can go about dealing with this situation:\n\n1. Grima is the captive and you’re not really ‘using’ him because he’s not under your control for the entire scenario.\n2. You chose Grima as the captive at the end of Breaking but you can’t use him in Treason, so you swap him for a different captive.\n3. Don’t choose Grima as the captive at the end of Breaking.\nMy original answer (#1) is stretching the definition of ‘using’ a little because I genuinely think it would be hilarious for the heroes to pursue a captive Grima only to discover his true allegiance after a long foot chase. If you’re worried about using the strictest interpretation, then I would go with answer #2 or #3.\nCheers,\nCaleb\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184483-aragorn-and-grima-in-breaking-of-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1729517","commentId":1729517,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1439231251,"content":"I gotta say, I like the flexibility he's allowing in the interpretation.  There wasn't a hard and fast answer about Grima.  Maybe acknowledging that this is a cooperative game, he's letting the players draw their own conclusions from the available text among concepts that aren't defined mechanically (like \"using\" a hero). "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184483-aragorn-and-grima-in-breaking-of-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1732442","commentId":1732442,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1439378932,"content":"I also enjoy the sense of humour.
