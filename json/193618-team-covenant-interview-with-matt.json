Any deck where I can include Sword that was Broken is a plus in my book. Still, it kinda makes sense for it to be Arwen. I mean, we already have her as an ally and that's already kinda far fetched in that we are acually travelling with her. Now of course I know her ally version could be interpreted as representing her support, telepathy or whatever but we're not really with her physically, much like Galadriel hero. Well, her hero version could be just that, and her art could her looking from a window or something. I mean, you're totally right, it's not like Tolkien gave her a lot of character or made more appearances in the book, but even then I like her character, and a hero kinda similar to Galadriel would be just fine IMO. I also think it's a bit too early for another version of Aragorn to come out.\n\nEdited November 15, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193618-team-covenant-interview-with-matt/?do=findComment&comment=1894032","commentId":1894032,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1447556858,"content":"> \"Discard a card to place 1 resource on any hero in play.  Limit 3 times per turn.\"\n\nThat would be nice because it would synergize with Core Aragorn too.\n\n \n\nI think Arwen is a pretty good bet.

But I agree with those who think three times a round would be way too powerful. I think once per round is still very nice, especially if the stats are decent as well (and with Arwen we can expect at least 2 willpower and a lowish threat cost), and more so if it can be placed on any hero (even if only any under your control).\n\nMaybe it is just a wishful thinking but discarding cards for resources is something that could really help the Noldor strategy, and certainly something to combo well with Lindir who then draws you cards when you play him. The fact he is mentioned specifically suggests you might actually be able to discard more than one card. Maybe it will be 2 cards for a resource? Either way, I cannot wait to see it...\n\nEdited November 18, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193618-team-covenant-interview-with-matt/?do=findComment&comment=1898336","commentId":1898336,"userName":"DunedainLoreKeeper","timestamp":1447855639,"content":"Nice interview, it's always fun to hear the designers themselves talk about the cards.\n\n \n\nNot sure why everybody loses their minds over 'attach to the threat dial'.

I don't think an ability of converting cards-to-resources would be wise, because combined with lore's resources-to-cards it can break the game easily. Just look at Love of Tales abuse."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193618-team-covenant-interview-with-matt/?do=findComment&comment=1898445","commentId":1898445,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1447860455,"content":"But it fits well within Spirit, I feel.
