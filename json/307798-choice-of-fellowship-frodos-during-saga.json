I've not played this far through the Saga boxes yet, but I couldn't see anything on a quick skim of the rules about any restrictions on Fellowship Aragorn (other than you can't use a non-Fellowship version).\n\nEdit: To answer my own question, I found this ruling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231270-frodo-fellowship-version-change/?do=findComment&comment=2437622]:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> It is not a misprint: each of the scenarios in The Treason of Saruman and The Flame of the West is balanced against the Fellowship Aragorn included in the respective box. You cannot swap them.\n\n \n\nEdited April 19 by steve83"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307798-choice-of-fellowship-frodos-during-saga/?do=findComment&comment=3928908","commentId":3928908,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1587260475,"content":"> 1 hour ago, steve83 said:\n> \n> Is this true!?
