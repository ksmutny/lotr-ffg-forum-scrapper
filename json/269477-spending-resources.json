During refresh phase i use tighten our belts which gives Denethor one resource since he didn't actually spend any resources.

If it says \"spend X resources to add that many resources to a hero's resource pool,\" then I'd say no.

I know that because I was playing the noldor allies who gain 1 defense each time a hero gain a resource from a card effect, and Denethor never help it :(.\n\nYes it will work. And if you spend one or two resources on Boromir, Boromir won't receive any resource but Denethor will gain a resource, because the game don't track who originally own the resource, it only check if the hero have or not spend a resource this turn."}]}
