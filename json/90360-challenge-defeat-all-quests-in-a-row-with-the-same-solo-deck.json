Passage through Mirkwood\n2. Journey along the Anduin\n3. Escape from Dol Guldur\n4. The hunt for Gollum       \n5. Conflict at the Carrock\n6. A journey to Rhosgobel     \n7. The Hills of Emyn Muil\n8. The dead marshes        \n9. Return to Mirkwood       \n\n10. Into the pit            \n11. The seventh level       \n12. Flight from Moria      \n13. The redhorn gate        \n14. Road to Rivendell   \n15. The watcher in the water    \n16. The long dark           \n17. Foundations of Stone    \n18. Shadow and flame        \n\n19. We must Away, here break of day\n20. Over the Misty Mountains grim\n21. Dungeons deep and caverns dim\n22. Flies and spiders       \n23. The lonely mountain     \n24. The battle of the five armies\n\n25. Peril in Pelargir       \n\n26. Into Ithilien           \n27. The siege of Cair Andros\n28. The steward's fear     \n29. The druadan forest     \n30. Encounter at Amon Din     \n31. Assault on Osgiliath      \n\n32. The Massing at Osgiliath    \n33. The battle of laketown        \n \n\nwithout changing any card of your deck between each quest (well except for adding treasures)\n\n \n\nThe goal is to succeed as many quests as possible (the ultimate goal being the streak of 33 !), with the average score as a tie-breaker.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI like this challenge for several reasons:\n\n \n\n- it really tests the versatility of a deck. In fact, I think this challenge is a very efficient way to \"rate\" the overall quality of a deck.\n\n \n\n- it adds some tension playing quests : the fact that you just don't retry if you lose adds some spice, some more thinking to the risks you take.\n\n \n\n- it makes me enjoy the easy quests, that I don't play otherwise : I take them more seriously knowing that the small chance I could be beaten actually matters - and I have to put some thoughts in taking risks to shoot for a high score, which also makes them more enjoyable.\n\n \n\n- it increases the storyline atmosphere : as quests are played one after the other with the same heroes, you better feel the adventure. Also, there is a special feeling anticipating the following tough quests when breathing through easier ones.\n\n \n\n \n\nI have been attempting the challenge with my best deck, but I am also looking forward playing it with mono-sphere decks! I'd be very curious to see which sphere scores the largest number of quests!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90360-challenge-defeat-all-quests-in-a-row-with-the-same-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=865945","commentId":865945,"userName":"Fanfan","timestamp":1379130483,"content":"To set the bar (hopefully high enough!), I managed to win 32 out of the 33 quests with my best deck, with an average 90.735 victory points.\n\n \n\nI enjoyed it a lot and I will now attempt this challenge with mono-sphere decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90360-challenge-defeat-all-quests-in-a-row-with-the-same-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=865997","commentId":865997,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1379136333,"content":"Do you keep damage or dead heroes from one quest to another ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90360-challenge-defeat-all-quests-in-a-row-with-the-same-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=866148","commentId":866148,"userName":"Fanfan","timestamp":1379163589,"content":"> Do you keep damage or dead heroes from one quest to another ?\n\n \n\nNo, I did not. First because it would favor decks with access to healing. And I think putting a single \"Fortune or fate\" in your deck and waiting for it once a game is virtually won would usually do the trick to save you from the dead hero problem.\n\n \n\nThe score keeps tracks of wounds and lost heroes. Losing one hero already harms you when playing a quest.

The goal of the deck is to consistently win every quest in normal mode. And I agree there is a small adjustment I made to the deck thinking about A Journey to Rhosgobel. The issue was to make the selection of cards that would dramatically increase my chances against AJtR without being detrimental to the other quests.\n\n \n\nAnd in fact, the loss I had against the Battle of Laketown was not where my odds are the worst. That's the appeal of this challenge: you need a deck that's consistent.\n\n \n\n> My outland deck (Hurluin, Theodred, Beravor) beat everything but Dol Guldur, when I did this awhile back.\n\n \n\nThis certainly sounds like a strong selection of heroes. But there is a good 10 quests that are not automatic wins, especially the ones putting a strong early pressure where outland deck is still fragile. Treacheries damaging all characters could be tough when Anfalas herdsman [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1786] refuses to show, and heavy staging areas can present a challenge when Ethir swordsmen [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1784] hide deep down in the deck.

His power is to consider very carefully, but can be very handy. A good situation to use his power is when:\n\n- you are questing for tons and have one or two test of will - in that situation treacheries and locations are not a worry and you can take the risk of shooting a minion.\n\n- you have a good idea that the encounter deck is strongly dominated by one kind of cards.\n\nWhite tower watchman  x  1\n\n     I playtested with more - he sounds great being able to handle one small and one big attack, but he did\n\n     not prove being that strong - I usually prefere paying one more for an attack-2 ally.\n\n \n\n \n\nAttachment (7)\n\n \n\nUnexpeted courage  x  2\n\n     This is usually a crazy card, but not that much in this deck that has light of Valinor for Glorfindel, and Eowyn being quite poor in the combat phase if you cna ready her. It is nice to put one on Frodo, but the second one is not very strong. Putting two in the deck is probably the right number.\n\nAncient Mathom  x  2\n\n     The most efficient way to draw cards in Spirit, but you rarely want to have 2 with your limited resources. Good target for dwarven tomb in long games.\n\nLight of Valinor  x  3\n\n      No brainer with Gorfindel - having it in your starting hand is a strong component for the muligan decision. You can discard extra with Eowyn\n\n \n\nEvent  (17)\n\n \n\nHasty stroke  x  3\n\n      strong, cheap and flexible\n\nA test of will  x  3\n\n      No brainer\n\nStand and fight  x  2\n\n      Very good card, but you don't really have combos with it in this deck with the timing of playing allies, and you sometimes prefer just drawing an ally in the early game, than being able to reuse one if he is discarded.\n\nDwarven tomb  x  3\n\n      This card shines in a mono-spirit deck. Yes you pay one more for the card, but there are so many good targets depending on the situation ... Elrond's councel, A test of will, ancient mathom, athe galadhrim's greeting, O Elbereth, a strong ally you discarded, or a cheap blocker.\n\nElrond's counsel  x  3\n\n      This card is very strong, especially in a deck limited in resources and including Frodo\n\nO Elbereth! Githonial !  x  1\n\n      This card is an oddball. You can sometimes play it for free, but even for 4, it is quite often a very good answer to nasty minions, including unique ones immune to atachments. I really struggled between including a second one or another cheap ally.\n\nThe Galadhrim's greeting  x  2\n\n      This card is virtually 6 more life for Frodo at worse. It offers a lot of flexibility. I could have included three but I prefered going strong on allies. But is is a frequent target for dwarven tomb.\n\n \n\nOther cards I considered:\n\n \n\nAgainst the shadow\n\nit sounded ok with cards like Eowyn, but it paled in comparison to The Galadhrim's greeting ... just one less resource, but 6 more life sounded better than a boost of defense, and it is much more flexible.\n\n \n\nKIli\n\nI though about adding a package of 2 Kilis + 1 Fili, but it did not make the cut ... yes, either 2 attack or 2 cheap blockers for just three resources. But it happens pretty often that you just draw Fili, or that Fili discards Emery, bith being frustraing.\n\n \n\nThere are no other cards that struck me as being worth a spot. Once I settled on the heroes, it was more in the selection of the number of each cards (previously discussed) that I had to do the fine tuning. My overall decision was to prioritize cheap allies for flexibility, over expensive contextual events.\n\nEdited September 21, 2013 by Fanfan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90360-challenge-defeat-all-quests-in-a-row-with-the-same-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=872463","commentId":872463,"userName":"Fanfan","timestamp":1379835209,"content":"And here is my report for my mono-spirit attempt.\n\n \n\nI succeeded in 27 quests out of the 33. I have mixed feelings. I had to work much harder to achieve this result than the one of my best deck, probably because the deck does not have the same row power, and also because I did not know it well. But it made the experience even more enjoyable!\n\n \n\nHere are my 6 defeats:\n\n- A journey to Rhosgobel\n\nWell, there is not much to say about it, my chances are quite small and there is a lot of randomness here. The deck can crazy quest if you happen to have a lucky Athelas draw in the first 5 encounter cards. You still have a chance later in the game with the good location and threat manipulation, but it is mainly up to the encounter deck. The game I played here did not leave any chance.\n\n- Return to Mirkwood\n\nI raced through Return to Mirkwood knowing a single big guy (Hill Troll or Attercop) could ruin me, but racing sounded as the best plan anyway. I revealed Hill Troll on the last stage of the quest when my threat was already high. My party was too small to handle him and my threat rocketed.\n\n- Dungeons deep and caverns dim\n\nThis was a surpring defeat as I thought mono-sphere would have an easy time with riddles ... I still think this was a very unlucky defeat. Bilbo missing to answer 3 riddles was unlikely to happen.\n\n- The lonely mountain\n\nThere is one critical turn in the lonely mountain : the first turn where Smaug the Magnificient shows up. In this game, he killed 5 of my characters on that turn and I could not come back.\n\n- Into Ithilien\n\nThis is probably the toughest quest for mono-spirit (maybe with A Journey to Rhosgobel). The simple fact it starts with a tough battle makes it hard. I managed to empty the staging area and encounter cards in play at one time, O Gilbereth-ed the Mumak, but achieving that had cost my little party too much and they could not make it through the end of the quest.\n\n- The siege of Cair Andros\n\nI did not manage to have a large enough board when the battelgrounds got claimed/destroyed ... then I drew a few tough opponents I had difficulties to deal with, like Lieutenant of Mordor activating southron support, when a battering ram was already in play.\n\n \n\nI'd say A journey to Rhosgobel and Into Ithilien were likely defeats,\n\nReturn to Mirkwood and Siege of Cair Andros were tough quests that could have gone either way,\n\nand Dungeons deep and caverns dim and The lonely mountain were unlucky defeats, with several streaks of bad luck on what looked like easy riddles, and an awful chain of attacks from Smaug the Magnificient.\n\n \n\nBut I also had succesfull quests:\n\nEscape from Dol Guldur\n\nI kept a hand with Light of Valinor and Northern Tracker. Glorfindel was the prisonner, but I could still play Northern tracker on turn 2 ... who basically did all the work. Actually, the match up for my mono-spirit deck against EfDG is not too bad: the only very annoying encounter cards are the low engagement-threat allies, because the deck usually quests well even with just 2 heroes. The game was long and tough, but globally went the right way.\n\nShadow and Flame\n\nThe battle of Laketown\n\nI had playtested against Smaug, and found that I needed to pack attack strength to win the Battle of Laketown, and slowly manage my threat until I had enough. The same was true for Shadow and flame. And it worked.\n\nMassing at Osgiliath\n\nI don't consider it a very  tough quest to beat with this deck, but it went very smoothly: an ithilien ranger popped just before I had to cross the Anduin, and O Elbereth Githonial got rid of the Witch King.\n\nThe steward's fear\n\nI think I had my closest victory ever on this one. I achieved the quest with only 2 cards in play, i.e. 2 heroes with one life remaining only, no attachment left, no ally left, 47 threats and a local trouble on both of my heroes, 3 cards left in deck with the plot aiming at empty my deck for the win, discarding my last card in hand for Eowyn to get the very last quest point.\n\nI would have lost at the end of the turn to:\n\n- the plot emptying my deck,\n\n- the engaged minions slaugthering my two near-death exhausted heroes.\n\n- the local troubles + threat increase in the refresh phase\n\n \n\nI am buying a virtual drink to anyone who could share a more desperate lucky ending !\n\n \n\nConclusion:\n\n \n\nI think mono-spirit can hope for a 30/33 with some luck, but it seems 27/33 is a an ok-result. I slightly improved my playing of the deck during this enjoyable run, but I don't think I did any obvious critical mistake that would have turned the tide. Losing the 2 hobbit quests was particularly unlucky.\n\n \n\nRESULT FOR MONO-SPIRIT:\n\n \n\n27 / 33   (98.67 average score)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90360-challenge-defeat-all-quests-in-a-row-with-the-same-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=875421","commentId":875421,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1380163023,"content":"I tried the first 9 quests (base 3 plus Mirkwood cycle) with a few different decks, and I'm not having nearly as much success as you guys.  This is pretty much the first time I've tried playing single handed, and I'm beginning to appreciate how much more challenging some scenarios can be solo.  Dol Goldur, Carrock, Rhosgobel, and Return to Mirkwood in particular are near impossible.  My best deck so far is Spirfindel, Beregond, and Faramir, but that deck wasn't able to beat any of those 4 on the first try.  I did beat Carrock and Mirkwood, but it pretty much requires light of valinor and Asfaloth in my starting hand.  The highlight so far was being able to one-shot a hill troll in the staging area with Faramir.\n\nEdited September 26, 2013 by Teamjimby"}]}
