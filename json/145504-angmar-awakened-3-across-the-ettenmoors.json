A big armored Olog-hai as a general of Mordor's army would be an interesting enemy, instead of yet another hill or wilderness troll.\n\nCouldn't agree more re the location not needing to be an objective, they really don't need to make the game more inconsistent or complex when it is totally unnecessary. I too would love to see an Olog-hai general or boss and am a little sick of Wild Trolls as well. Why have we not seen a single siege style quest with any trolls? I'm sure Sauron utilized them in such battles and would have had at least a handful in each of his mighty hosts. The Siege of Cair Andros or The Massing at Osgiliath both could have easily included trolls that are not wild. \n\n \n\nI am actually not a fan of the art for Cruel Mountain Troll. The horns seem wrong and that grey hair looks too much like tattered rags to me.... plus it seems a little too big.... not sure how exactly our heroes take on something that size and easily slay it. Looks far bigger than any other troll and more similarly sized to the Stone Giants from the Hobbit or even the Balrog yet has stats very similar to any other troll. His mechanics are great though, removing progress for any overflow damage done if the defending character bites the dust. I like that this has remained as a standard troll ability with slight variations;\n\nwe now have a troll that turns any excess damage into threat, a troll that places excess damage on a second character and one that turns excess damage into a loss of progress tokens. \n\n \n\nThe ruthless hill troll however looks amazing and I really like that art. More brutal, less typical billy goats gruff troll looking and more like a massive hulking Uruk. I also really like the mechanic of it being stronger when damaged.\n\n \n\nPlayer cards sound pretty varied in this one and it sounds like we will get an actual ent character and not just ent focused cards that might be attachments or events. The new hero is tactics which always excites me and sounds like it is going to be a new defensive hero! I really can't make up my mind on what I think of the tactics sidequest...... for combat heavy scenarios it might be just what you need to take out some especially nasty foes that are stopping your progression. It has 8 quest points however so may take more than just one turn to clear if you fall short on questing power. One thing to note is that because you get to discard an enemy engaged with each player you can use more offensive characters to quest with rather than saving them for combat which makes clearing the player quest far easier. As well as this it can be ANY non unique enemy (that is not immune) so you can discard some real heavy hitters (like the trolls in this new quest!) with it. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1531084","commentId":1531084,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1428378372,"content":">  \n> \n> > Ent player card confirmed!

Ad that's 2 Hero slots and a costly card you're devoting just to defend one enemy each round: it doesn't look good, in my opinion.\n\n \n\nCompare Dori to Erkenbrand (clearly the best defender we have so far IMO): with a warden of Healing on the table, Erkenbrand basically has Shadow cancellation and Sentinel for one less defense, and he doesn't really need the Warden turn 1, since he can usually resist for a couple of attacks without healing.\n\nIf you need to defend more enemies, additional healing and an unexpected courage is all that it takes.\n\nDori on the other hand needs another hero to use his ability (that's 2 actions and hero slots spent), provides absolutely no shadow cancellation and it is much harder to make him help with more than 1 defense, since you would need a courage for both him and the target defender.\n\nThe only advantage I see for Dori is that he is a Tactics hero, granting in-sphere access to Feint and ohter Tactics combat tricks; however this is questionable, as sometimes Leadership might actually be more useful.\n\nOf course if there is an unspoiled Tactics attachment that has something like: \"after attached hero defends or adds his defence to another hero, discard a shadow from the attacking enemy\" or \"after ---- ready this hero\" that would change things, but as it is now I see no reason to play Dori (even comparing to Beregond, Dori looks like a subpar choice). I'm almost certain we will see something to help Dori though.\n\n \n\nThe only real good thing in this new hero so far is.. the art. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nSebastian Giacobino surely is my favourite artist, at the moment.\n\nEdited August 28, 2015 by Eu8L1ch"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1760479","commentId":1760479,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1440764837,"content":"Anybody noticed that the Tactics side quest Delay the enemy is 8 quest points instead of the usual 4 points?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1760495","commentId":1760495,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1440765769,"content":"> I just thought of something.

That just makes it way too narrow a focus. Make it work on allies and he could see niche use when you want that kind of defensive flexibility (alternatively you end up using your defensive allies like non-restricted attachments for Dori, you could have some fun with that), but having it only work on other heroes...

I think it is much better than Tighten Our Belts in certain decks. I personally will be replacing all 3 copies of Tighten Our Belts with Ranger supplies in my decks. Yes it costs one as opposed to zero and you have to actually explore the location to get the benefit AND it affects the first player and not a player of choice HOWEVER it allows you to gain resources after the quest phase which can be very useful for certain cards such as the Brothers Elladan and Elrohir. Also it is a guaranteed three resources (four in Saga) as opposed to Tighten Our Belts which I often use for 2 and on rare occasions 1 resource if I have to and obtaining said resources does not require you to not spend resources that turn, you simply gain them when the location leaves play. Technically because you are paying a resource to use Ranger Supplies it really only gains you two resources however you do not need to save resources to gain this effect and you will always gain the full three resources. \n\nNow we only have it in Spanish and apparently it is just \"attach to a location\" and not the active location which means you could easily combo it with Asfaloth and can clear a location in staging and still trigger this card. You could therefore play it and gain the three (two) resources instantly if you are able to explore the location with Asfaloth during planning. If it is active location then I will probably stick with Tighten Our Belts to be honest..... heres hoping!\n\nLastly the art on Ranger supplies is really cool and fits in far better with my Elf/Ranger/Ent decks than Tighten our Belts does."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1768333","commentId":1768333,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1441147335,"content":"All cards for across the ettenmoors are now up on cardgamedb!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1768955","commentId":1768955,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1441180600,"content":"http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/angmar-awakened-cycle/across-the-ettenmoors/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/angmar-awakened-cycle/across-the-ettenmoors/]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145504-angmar-awakened-3-across-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1769007","commentId":1769007,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1441183504,"content":"Hope Rekindled [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/angmar-awakened-cycle/across-the-ettenmoors/hope-rekindled-r1608] have surprised me as I've seem to have misseed it.
