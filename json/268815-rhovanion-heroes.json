a Dale deck with the new Brand, the bow can also read \"+1 willpower, draw a card when played.\"\n\nCombo with Foe Hammer and Goblin Cleaver is awkward because it requires a hero attachment, and I don't see using this cheap weapon using a restricted slot on an attacking hero.  It's an ally boost, not quite as good as Dwarrowdelf Axe, but cheaper and eligible for a lot more targets.  In the inevitable Bard/Brand/Bard deck you can use it with Straight Shot.  I'm guessing the real synergy may be with attachment-loving Dale allies, though from the little we know of Warrior of Dale it may not be with him.  It'd be great on Knight of Dale once Valour is reached, assuming the new Brand is used.\n\nWhat are the character/ally attachments that can go on Dale allies?  So far there's only five released or spoiled, three are scouts and one are warrior, while the partially spoiled Warrior of Dale is a warrior.  That allows, ordered by resources:\n\n3 Lore -- Self Preservation\n\n3 Tactics -- Vigilant Guard (warrior)\n\n2 Lore -- Burning Brand (lore only)\n\n2 Tactics -- Spear of the Citadel (tactics only)\n\n2 Tactics -- Raiment of War (warrior)\n\n1 Neutral -- Elf-friend\n\n1
