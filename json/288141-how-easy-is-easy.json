My buddy and I have been playing a Road Darkens in easy mode and we still can't beat it. It's all just disheartening and I feel like we are bad at this game. \n\nEven easy mode in LotR is considerably harder than other co-op/solo games, and Road Darkens is not the friendliest point of entry for new players (I assume you've just started with this game?). Usually, each successive expansion has harder quests to account for the growing pool of player cards.  As for \"bad at this game,\" you probably just didn't take enough time to learn the basics of strategy with just the Core Set before moving on to expansions, especially ones that are more veteran friendly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/288141-how-easy-is-easy/?do=findComment&comment=3573088","commentId":3573088,"userName":"ScottGilbert25","timestamp":1545404625,"content":"We are not new to the game.
