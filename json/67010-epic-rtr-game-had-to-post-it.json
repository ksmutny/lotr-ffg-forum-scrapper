We did quite well. Got one early Sleeping Sentry but it did no damage and by traveling to Ruined Road to we could even ready a hero to block the single enemy we had in the staging area……..\n\n\n \n\n\nThe game went quite well from there on. Had another SS but canceled it. In mid game, while in stage 2 we got Orc Ambush.\n\n\n12 Orcs, but thanks to Lure of Moria and then an Orcslayer in the next round we managed to stay alive.\n\n\nAt one time we still had 6 enemies engaged and we knew we could only get rid of two shadows.\n\n\n \n\n\nBlack Uruks were blocked by a Gondorian Spearman and thus killed.\n\n\nOne Orc was blocked by Bifur with Burning Brand….. after revealing the shadow cards we felt sooooo lucky……both were Sleeping Sentry.\n\n\n \n\n\nSo after that we managed to get in the game again…….and then in the middle of stage 3, we got Orc Ambush again ( first encounter card )……….thankfully my second player could cancel the when reveaed effect. It surged into something normal and then………………………………………………\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAAAAHAHAHAHA Orc Ambush again.

I always felt like it was only one, as I only got it rarely.
