Till now i was thinking that every Adventure pack adds a new stage to the scenario of the cycle.\n\n \n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126298-question-about-adventure-pack-cycles/?do=findComment&comment=1320796","commentId":1320796,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1415036547,"content":"All you missed is a hero, a bunch of player cards and a quest.

In the case of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, it's just the core set that you need. No adventure packs are dependent on any other adventure packs, even though the packs are designed to provide one large story."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126298-question-about-adventure-pack-cycles/?do=findComment&comment=1321117","commentId":1321117,"userName":"Ryodu","timestamp":1415047300,"content":"Like everyone else has said, all you really lose is a hero card, some player cards, and of course the quest. You might lose out on the story being out of line or weirdly paced because you're missing a part of the story, but it's not that big of a loss, especially in the older adventure packs.\n\n \n\nThe Hunt for Gollum is getting reprinted at least in english, so hopefully in other languages as well. It's been hard to find on my end for awhile now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126298-question-about-adventure-pack-cycles/?do=findComment&comment=1321312","commentId":1321312,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1415054347,"content":"F5Q9A3,\n\n \n\nIf you are curious to see what cards are in the Hunt for Gollum AP, go to this link: http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/the-hunt-for-gollum/.  [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/the-hunt-for-gollum/.%C2%A0]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126298-question-about-adventure-pack-cycles/?do=findComment&comment=1321773","commentId":1321773,"userName":"F5Q9A3","timestamp":1415098616,"content":"Thank you to all of you for the answers"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126298-question-about-adventure-pack-cycles/?do=findComment&comment=1323370","commentId":1323370,"userName":"MightyRauros","timestamp":1415200007,"content":"Starting with Against the Shadow, the designers have tried to link the scenarios more thematically (with a continuous story), but even then the packs are still playable out of order."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126298-question-about-adventure-pack-cycles/?do=findComment&comment=1323407","commentId":1323407,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1415201453,"content":"To be honest I dont really like idea when we cannot use some heroes un certain scenarios like Blood of Gondor or Morgul Vale and Fight at Isen. Some decks just suffer. Hope ffg dont do it anymore.\n\nI see some players play Grima hero and Objective Grima ally also was there but no one wonna change the Hero since deck is build up around him. That quite stupid situation but designers bring players that way to make that rules for adventures packs. Hope they will not do it anymore"}]}
