What do you think these could be?\n\nI personally think 1 will be \"Draw one card\" (especially as there does not appear to be much space for the text of the fourth option..) but can't really guess what the other might be.... I was thinking maybe \"heal up to 2 damage from a hero he controls\" \n\nThat would even be handy in solo for 1 neutral resource to be able to heal some damage that you need to get rid of. I'm not so sure it will be this however, as it seems a bit random and not quite as thematic as readying a hero, gaining resource or drawing a card (then again Elrond is on the white council and is a renowned healer....).\n\n \n\nAny ideas on what the two unrevealed options might be?\nAlso is anyone as excited at how good this card may be? I for one am very excited to use the readying and resource abilities (especially for first turn steward of gondor) as well as whatever the other two might be!\n\nEdited May 18, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106545-the-white-council-the-dunland-trap/?do=findComment&comment=1088895","commentId":1088895,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1400416994,"content":"Why are you so sure about the number of options?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106545-the-white-council-the-dunland-trap/?do=findComment&comment=1088900","commentId":1088900,"userName":"ZanzibarLand","timestamp":1400417448,"content":"Ready, resource...

No more than that though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106545-the-white-council-the-dunland-trap/?do=findComment&comment=1089167","commentId":1089167,"userName":"ana4","timestamp":1400436264,"content":"Discard may be for a Shadow card, too.
