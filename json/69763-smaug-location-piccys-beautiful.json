In MAO last stage can bring you lot of surprise (cose of Massing in Osgiliatn threachery or Captain effect) here is everything more monotony and if you are reach a certain point the encounter deck cannot do nothing against you(little bit remind me SAF).But still this one really cool quest and quite difficult as well.

But when you understand the idea so then you can win. Smaug is the key in this deck.\n\nIf you have manage his attack you done. Problem is Smaug is moving around a lot and you never know what can happen next turn. SO you must to have hevy defense hero to be able deal with a Smaug. But Smaug can attack more then 2 times and more then 1 players in 1 round in quest phase and combat phase. And sometimes thank to shadow effect he can attack twice in the row. But if you can manage his attack you will win is only matter of time. But is really hard to manage his attack that is a problem. You must to have tank hero like Dain or Elrond."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69763-smaug-location-piccys-beautiful/?do=findComment&comment=683093","commentId":683093,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1346075925,"content":"muemakan said:\n\n Wow, if I didn´t make some mistakes due to not having the rules for this pack and only using the stuff I found on this forum I have just beaten Smaug. \n\nI made a print out copy and decided to try my dwarf solo deck for one quick try……wasn´t that quick in the end.\n\n \n\nUsed Dain, Ori and Bifur.

You can play attachments on locations that are immune to player card effects. If a card cannot have attachments, then it will read \"Cannot have attachments.\" However, cards that are immune to player card effects will be immune to the abilities of attachments. So you can play Power in the Earth on the Troll Cave, but it will have no effect on that location. Card like Ancient Mathom and Path of Need work differently because they don't affect the location, so their abilities will still work.\nThanks for asking,\nCaleb\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69763-smaug-location-piccys-beautiful/?do=findComment&comment=690036","commentId":690036,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1347105007,"content":"Memetix said:\n\nI have a query about how to interpret \"immune to player card effects\", I suspect this phasing will be used again (i.e. Beorn) and I'm not sure how far reaching the phrase 'Cards with the text \"immune to player card effects\" ignore the effects of all player cards.' really is.\n\n\n\nI still think my interpretation is justified… gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\nBut I am interested to see if they have an official ruling that addesses the issue…\n\nMemetix said:\n\nHere's a scenario\nSmaug (the battle for laketown) attacks and the revealed shadow card is Esgaroth Wharf (Shadow: Attacking enemy gets +2 att, then it makes an additional attack after this one).\n\nThe defender has a burning brand.\n\"While attached character is defending, cancel any shadow effects on cards dealt to the attacking enemy.\"\n\nSo Smaug gets +2 att from the shadow effect then burning brand cancels this effect.

Burning brand targets the shadow cards and not Smaug, so it still works. The +1 defense from Dunedain Warning modifies the attached character, not Smaug, so it still works. An example of cards that wouldn't work against his immunity to card effects would be Radagast's Cunning or Feint because they try to modify Smaug.\n\n\n \n\nI then asked\n\nIn the Hobbit expansion it defines the term \"immune to player card effects\" as.\nCards with the text \"immune to player card effects\" ignore the effects of all player cards.

Smaug doesn't ignore the effects of all player cards. If he did, he would ignore the effects of a Dunedain warning on a defender.
