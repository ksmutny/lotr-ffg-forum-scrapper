I can post the exact text when I get home, but for now here's how it works:\n\nIf your threat is 20 or less you can play the card for it's cost minus the secrecy.\n\nSo for example, 'Timely Aid' is cost 4, secrecy 3, so it will play for 1 resource if your threat is 20 or less.\n\nThe only other rule for it is that you can ONLY get the secrecy discount when playing the card FROM HAND.\n\nHope that helps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61461-secrecy-official-text/?do=findComment&comment=602488","commentId":602488,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1330966150,"content":"im really pleased with secrecy- theyve managed to make a rule and keyword that for once doesnt raise a thousand questions about how to play it"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61461-secrecy-official-text/?do=findComment&comment=602519","commentId":602519,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1330968967,"content":"Ok, exact text from the flyer insert for official-ness:\n\n\"Secrecy X\" Keyword\n\nSecrecy is a new keyword introduced on player cards in the Dwarrowdelf Cycle. Secrecy lowers the cost to play the card by the specified value, provided the threat of the player who is playing the card is 20 or below. Secrecy only applies when the card is played from hand, and never modifies the printed cost of the card.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "}]}
