I've played it where you get the chance to attack and kill an enemy before it attacks you, but if you do not kill it, it will still attack you and and then you will move to your regular attack phase after all enemies have attacked as normal.\n\nIts a little cooler with characters like Dunhere, who can basically attack something in the staging area anytime rather than the combat round, or a ranged character, who can attack an enemy in front of another player (but not in the staging area.) I think its a great card if you're playing with either type of character, and pretty useful in general."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46063-what-is-quick-strike/?do=findComment&comment=462196","commentId":462196,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1304321399,"content":"coyotemoon722 said:\n\nuhm....wow I even fail at this forum.\n\n\n\nDon't worry, it's the crappy forum software that is at fault."}]}
