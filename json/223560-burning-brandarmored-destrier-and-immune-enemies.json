Excellent design, even though I'm cringing at the thought of facing the Witch-King.

One can say that ToF's effect does not target shadow card directly, but it targets defending character...\nToF effect: Response: When a shadow card increases an enemy's Attack by any amount, increase the defending character's Defense by 3 for that attack. Then, the players as a group may spend 2 Tactics resources to ready the defending character and give it +3 Attack for its next attack this phase.\nThe Balrog's text: (...) The Balrog and shadow cards dealt to The Balrog are immune to player card effects. (...)\nAnd Many-pillared Hall's shadow effect: Shadow: Attacking enemy gets +1 Attack (+2 Attack instead if the defending player's threat is 35 or higher). Thanks in advance, cheers, Michal\nA: Hi Michal, You can play Tides of Fate in the situation you describe because Tides of Fate doesn’t impact the Balrog or it’s shadow effect. Cheers, Caleb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223560-burning-brandarmored-destrier-and-immune-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=2415150","commentId":2415150,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1473928983,"content":"There is one other situation in which shadow cards are immune to player card effects: during the night while playing Wastes of Eriador.
