I hope this isn't considered thread resurrection, given that challenge #3 is already up.\n\n \n\nI felt like building a mono-Lore Gondor ranger trap deck, with the new Damrod hero and some new related cards. Lost twice very early, and won on my third try in a long and very controlled game.\n\n \n\nHeroes:  Damrod, Faramir, Denethor\n\nI think I got Henamarth Riversong in my opening hand or the first/second turn, and since then he scried the top card of the encounter deck each turn, helping me plan my turn and prepare for dealing with that single card. If I saw Blocking Wargs, Denethor immediately exhausted to send them to the bottom of the deck.\n\n \n\nI got two Mithrandir's Advice pretty quickly, one in my opening hand, which helped me with some cards; Burning Brand and a first Protector of Lorien came up pretty quickly and landed on Denethor, and Wingfoot went on Faramir after 5-7 turns, which with Henemarth meant he both quested for 4 (in the first, Battle, quest phase, which took all but the last 4 or 5 turns of the game) and then readied to be available for attacking. A first Master of the Forge also came up in the first few turns, and I think then died to a Haradrim Elite - my only character casualty - after two great uses; a second one immediately followed, so that alone gave me an extra card each turn (26 attachments means I never misfired with this).\n\n \n\nI tricked one Ithilien Archer and one Ithilien Lookout with my Elfstones, which was cool. And I kept landing Ranger Spikes on the 25 (or 27?) threat spiders, which was important, and on one Soutron Company. So I basically took a single enemy each time I could afford not sending Damrod to quest, and then he and Wingfooted-Faramir killed that single dude. Got one use of Ambush, which was good.\n\n \n\nExpert Treasure Hunter came around about 10 turns before game end or so, and saying \"attachment\" each time I only misfired once or twice. Together with Damrod netting me a card each time a trap attached, and the aforementioned Mithrandir's Advice X 2 and Master of the Forge, I had a lot of cards in my hand at all times. I'm glad I went with 56 cards, as I got down to at least 15, if not less, by the end of the game. And they were put to good use too - the first Protector of Lorien on Denethor allowed me to discard a card or two to defend precisely, and the second one went on Faramir a short time before finishing quest stage one, which helped me quest quickly in the following stage 3 (Celador lived) and than in the siege-ish stage 4 (discard the full 3 for each of Denethor and Faramir to power quest through it).\n\n \n\nOther cards that played their part:\n\n * Anborn was only there for the last quarter of the game, perhaps, but he got me the crucial Ranger Spikes back again and again to keep everything in the staging area, and with a low threat.\n * Ithilien Tracker canceled the Mumak, and a couple other things. Also, he had a...\n * Ranger Bow, with was used more than a few times together with...\n * Forest Patrol to get one Southron Company and either one or two spiders, while at the staging area.\n * Ambush. Only used it once, to kill Haradrim Elite before their second, non-forced attack, but I liked it.\n\nCards that I ended up not using, and I might take out in future versions of this deck:\n\n * Deep Knowledge - Usually I couldn't risk the threat. When I could, I had more than enough cards.\n * Expert Trackers  - Used once, I think to get two progress on a location (not sure). Could be nice with the Mumak, but generally most locations were discarded as shadows in this play-through.\n * Mablung (ally) - Actually played him and didn't use his ability.\n * Ithilien Pit & Forest Snare & Poisoned Spikes - Didn't use the first two, the third only once, maybe. I'd say Ranger Spikes and Ambush are more important to this deck. But their synergy with numerous cards in this deck should keep some of those in there. \n\nI didn't get to use Warden of Healing, White Tower Watchman, Quickbeam and Envoy of Pelargir, which were there for resource smoothing (as the other allies are quite expensive), but it ended up OK. Not sure about them. The ally rangers are a little more important here, but Quickbeam will stay because he's so good, and WTW for defending when Denethor uses his ability before questing. The others may go.\n\n \n\nAbsolute stars: All heroes. Ranger Spikes X 100. Wingfoot. Protector of Lorien. Burning Brand. Advice. Master of the Forge. Henamarth.\n\nAlso nice: Ranger Bow. Ambush. Forest Patrol. Ithilien Tracker \n\n \n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed playing with this deck.
