Before I get into specifics, there's a general question : when playing multi-player, how careful are you going to be about the rules? Will you back-up and do-over in a case like below? Will you just stretch the rules a little if the end result is the same?\n\nTheodred : Response: After Théodred commits to a quest, choose a hero committed to that quest. Add 1 resource to that hero's resource pool.\n\nAragorn : Response: After Aragorn commits to a quest, spend 1 resource from his resource pool to ready him.\n\nKeep in mind that responses are supposed to be used immediately.\n\nSituation 1 : Quest phase; Aragorn has a resource token, and you want to use both him and Theodred to quest.\n\nCorrect play: Aragorn exhausts to commit, and you spend his resource to ready him. Theodred exhausts to commit, and gives Aragorn 1 resource.\n\nIncorrect play with same outcome : Theodred exhausts to commit; Aragorn exhausts to commit; use Theodred's ability to give Aragorn a resource; spend that resource to ready Aragorn. Incorrect (I believe) because Theodred's ability has to be used the moment he commits to the quest, and instead it was used later.\n\nIn this next situation, this nit-picky timing issue really matters.\n\nSituation 2 : Quest phase, Aragorn has no resources, and you want to use both him and Theodred to quest.\n\nCorrect play : Aragorn exhausts to commit. Theodred exhausts to commit, and gives Aragorn 1 resource. At least next turn Aragorn will be able to both quest and fight, but this round Aragorn is exhausted.\n\nIncorrect play : Aragorn exhausts to commit. Theodred exhausts to commit, and gives Aragorn 1 resource. You spend Aragorn's resource to ready him.\n\nAnother incorrect play : Theodred exhausts to commit. Aragorn exhausts to commit. Theodred gives Aragorn 1 resource, and you spend that resource to ready Aragorn.\n\nMoral of the story : keep a resource on Aragorn if you want to use him twice per round!\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45569-aragorn-theodred-and-responses/?do=findComment&comment=457123","commentId":457123,"userName":"Apophenia","timestamp":1303392244,"content":" I have been playing that you commit all of your characters simultaneously then you just trigger the reactions in whatever order you desire. Of course that might be wrong but that is how those sorts of things worked in Call of Cthulhu, A Game of Thrones, and Warhammer Invasion so I thought it was a good precedent to follow. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45569-aragorn-theodred-and-responses/?do=findComment&comment=457129","commentId":457129,"userName":"TheProfessor","timestamp":1303393231,"content":" Who knows for sure at this point, but I think the original poster is correct.  The question is about what does \"After\" really mean.  In the other games (CoC, etc.) it usually mean \"Immediately after, and before you do anything else\", which is what the OP is considering and analyzing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45569-aragorn-theodred-and-responses/?do=findComment&comment=457152","commentId":457152,"userName":"Doc, the Weasel","timestamp":1303396549,"content":"I agree with Apophenia that characters are committed simultaneously (which is the scenario that the OP didn't take into consideration).

The rulebook really only says \"Each player may commit characters to the current quest card. Characters are exhausted when they commit to a quest.\" It is clear that one player does all of there characters before the next player decided who they want to submit.\n\nI'm just basing my interpretation on the rules for the other LCG. We probably won't know which of us is right until an FAQ is released. Plus I want to abuse the Aragorn and Theodred combo and it is a coop game so Sauron won't get too upset if I play this way. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45569-aragorn-theodred-and-responses/?do=findComment&comment=457602","commentId":457602,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1303471284,"content":"Doc, the Weasel said:\n\n \n\nI agree with Apophenia that characters are committed simultaneously (which is the scenario that the OP didn't take into consideration).
