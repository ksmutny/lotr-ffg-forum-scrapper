It seams wired.\n\nShort Answer\nQ1 - No. There is no RIGHT CLICK on CARD/SEND TO TOP OF ENCOUNTER DISCARD, yet.\n\nQ2- No. The \"reveal\" functions do not work on the encounter deck. Do not use it. BUT it works 100% for the player decks, so use this for \"Gandalf's Search\" or \"Mountains of Mirkwood\" or \"Gildor Inglorion\" or any card that scrys the PLAYER DECK. Eventually you will be able to use this function on the encounter deck but as yet it is NOT possible.\n\nLong Answer\nLackeyCCG is a constant work in progress, the addition of \"shared zones\" witch I am using for the encounter deck is relitivly new addition to lackey. So at this time there are some problems though they will be addressed eventually.\n\nQ1 - The best way to handle the \"encounter discard\" is to open the encounter discard pile on the right hand column. Then simply drag the discarded encounter cards to it. Remeber there are game functions that key off the discard decks ORDER. So it is important to drag to the correct place, this means the VERY TOP of the discard pile. This can be irksome as well due to the fact the it is very easy to drag to the wrong place as the position slider on the far left can sometimes not be pushed always to the top, so while it looks like you are dragging to the correct position you are in fact dragging to somewhere in the middle of the deck. So if you use this method, you need to make sure you drag to the TOP of the column, and also that the slider bar is hard pushed to the TOP.\n\n7148316.jpg [http://www3.picturepush.com/photo/a/7148316/220/7148316.jpg] [http://www3.picturepush.com/photo/a/7148316/img/7148316.jpg]\n\nThe other method, is more safe, but can be a bit annoying, as the \"drag\" target is small especially on high resolution monitors. Still, this is the safest method, if you drag the card you wish to discard to either of the ENCOUNTER DISCARD tabs, it will always place the card on the top of the encounter deck in the correct place.\n\n7148314.jpg [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7148314/220/7148314.jpg] [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7148314/img/7148314.jpg]\n\nQ2 - The \"RIGHT CLICK on DECK/REVEAL TOP X CARDS\" function works 100% perfectly on the player decks.\n\nAt the moment though it dose NOT WORK on the encounter deck. Simply do not use it. Remember most card affects that allows you to scry the encounter deck, for example Hunt for Gollum quest effect or Denathor's ability are \"private\" effects due to the \"no table talk\" rule. The scry'n decisions are NOT group decisions.\n\nSo until the \"RIGHT CLICK on DECK/REVEAL TOP X CARDS\" function on the encounter deck can select individual players to only be able to see the cards, it is not usable and be legal to the rules of the game. For at the moment when using this function \"everyone\" can see the cards and there is no way to stop that.\n\nOn top of that, the popup window is unable to send cards to the correct discard pile, so that needs to be fixed as well, and I am sure it will be addressed when ever the LackeyCCG designer gets a chance. He is very busy and of course needs to consider many more games than just LoTRs when he is doing upgrades to LackeyCCG.\n\non the encounter deck is not working either. Witch is why in my game demo for HFG I scryed the encounter deck using the \"drag\" method. This is defiantly the most irksome bug in lackey for LoTR-LCG and needs to be addressed b4 I can claim this plugin is 100% conversion. Still this will be fixed in latter releases of LackeyCCG.\n\nFor now rule of thumb is SIMPLY DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION ON THE ENCOUNTER DECK.\n\nFor an demo on how to scry the encounter deck.. click this link... for now this is the only way to do it legally according to the rules.\n\nUsing Denathor -\n\n\n\nHFG Quest Effect -\n\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nHave fun\n--Tragic\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=567096","commentId":567096,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1323773677,"content":"I've got lackey and OCTGN.

I have been playing with the beta and I am happy to tell you that the \"Reveal X cards\" on the encounter deck button is 98% working and will most lily be released by the next AP! As well as a number of other small bugs with the encounter deck, like the log not displaying \"shuffle\" when someone shuffles the deck. The new lackey is not out yet.. but will be soon.\n\nNOTE 2: - All 4 Versions of the plugin will now show in the Plugin Install area. The versions just control resolution and they are MAX, HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW. One of the buttons is slightly cut off, this is the MAX version.. you can still click the button though.

Including The Hills of Emyn Muil and The Massing at Osgiliath!! Also there have been some big changes a the application level of LackeyCCG from the developer as well....\n\nMost notable is the inclusion of COUNTER IMAGES....\n\ncounters [http://www4.picturepush.com/photo/a/7729722/img/7729722.jpg]\n\n\nSo you add counters just as b4, but now it will add the counters form the real game, 1st counter will look like the Witch King card, and as you add more counters text will appear on top of the counter like this. This should mean that no matter the card art, the counters should always be easy to read!\n\nIf for any reason your counters are to small and the text is not on top of them (due to scale and monitor issues) there is an option in the PREFERENCES under the APPEARANCE tab where you can set the scale of the counters from 20% to something higher.\n\noptions [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7729724/img/7729724.jpg]\n\n\nAlso for you solo players. You can now add as many players as you like to a solo game! Just right click on the TEST DUMMY player and select ADD SEAT and a new dummy will be added. This is great for deck testing if you are building a 2 or 3 player deck, or just want to play a 2 or 3 deck solo game.\n\nbots [http://www3.picturepush.com/photo/a/7729741/img/7729741.jpg]\n\n\nOnce you are playing, just select yourself in the list (the top one) and use these arrow keys to access the other decks!!\n\nbots2 [http://www2.picturepush.com/photo/a/7729745/img/7729745.jpg]\n\n\nAlso there is a TON of cool /commands for the chat window... so many I can not list them all but some really awesome ones are\n\n/chooseplayer (select a player at random to go first)\n/senddeck S (This will send you current deck to the other player neat way of sharing decks if your playing with randoms)\n\n\nI'm pretty busy nowdays so my videos might be slow.. but I will be doing an updated tutorial that should be way more simple and short and easy to reference with how to use the plugin...\n\n\nAnyway.. hope you guys like it.. let me know as always if there are any problems!!!\n\nHave fun and Stay Safe\n--Tragic "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=603041","commentId":603041,"userName":"Ted Sandyman","timestamp":1331088722,"content":"Hi ya tragic, i really enjoy your play through videos.

Now next time LackeyCCG loads it will use the default keybindings I set up for you.\n\n == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == WARNING == -- == \n\nOk, so what is becoming my regular 2nd update a day after the release of the main update due to all the errors people find it UP!!! Enjoy...\n\nBig thanks to Bis2Fioute for pointing out that Descendant and Gildor card images were reversed.. so that is fixed...\n\nAlso Duke of Lizards (awesom-o name btw) asked:\n\n * \"every time I play an attachment, it ends up covering up a hero. Then I select the hero, drag him around and put him back on top. This quickly becomes unwieldy with 4 or 5 attachments to order. Is there a faster way to handle this?\"\n\nAnd I responded:\n\n * um.. I'm not sure... I do not find it a problem in any way personally, in fact I like it like this as it is exactly how real cards work... Basically I just drag select the cards on the table and move them to the side and place the new card, then drag the stacks of stuff with the hero at the top and then place it again. There used to be options in lackey to set it so that placing a card will always go to the bottom, but these options seam to be gone. There is a option called HOVER I have not set up that I can add to the card functions that will make a card unselectable... but all cards will be placed on table go under it... this might be a option... I'll look into this for you.\n\nSo I looked into it and it worked pretty neat.. so I did it!!! WOOOT\n\nSo if you select a card and hit ALT+H (default binding) or right click on the card and select HOVER it will raise that card into the air, off the table. Now any card that is put on it, will go underneath. You can tap and add counters while it is hovering if you like so you can always have it hovering, or you can raise it up, then place your attachments then drop it on the table and it will land on top of everything.\n\n\nAlso, I added a new counter for \"reminders\" here are a 3 examples of how it is meant to be used.....\n\ncards [http://www5.picturepush.com/photo/a/7737253/img/7737253.jpg]\n\nAs you can see it is just a nice bright generic counter you can use to track modified stats, like in this example Gimli has 3 wounds, so he is now hitting for 5. So this counter is just to remind us of that. The Hunter card has a \"4\" on it.. cause there is 1 Clue token in play, witch gives him +2 attack / Defense... again just to remind us. And on the Quest card, I use this counter to denote victory points....\n\n\nAnyway... this is about it I think!!\n\nPlease let me know if there are any more errors!!\n\nHave Fun and Stay Safe\n--Tragic\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTed Sandyman said:\n\n \n\nHi ya tragic, i really enjoy your play through videos.

I appreciate that.\n\nI do get asked for a Dol Guldur video a lot, and I will do one, but not until I have access to the Khazad Dum card pool. This quest is just to hard for me to play solo especially with play a limited card pool. I know it is beatable and stuff.. but I simply do not enjoy playing it.\n\nThough once the card pool gets bigger I will post a video for that quest... and I should get around to the other quest as well. Like after Khazs solo players have the good to run Guldur and it is a very fun solo quest now imo.. just not back in the day. I think a lot of the \"hard\" quests will be like this as the card pool gets larger.. bringing life to old quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=603095","commentId":603095,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1331104744,"content":" Wandering Took is from the spirit sphere...."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=603116","commentId":603116,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1331108380,"content":"muemakan said:\n\nWandering Took is from the spirit sphere....\n\n\n\nI meant Keen-Eyed Took... sorry"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=632216","commentId":632216,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1337226439,"content":"Been away for a while.. sorry about the delay.. here are the 2 packs for last month and this month!\n\nPlease contact me though replying to this a thread or a PM or w/e to let me know if there are any errors.\n\n\nVersion 2.6 - The end of the Mirkwood Cycle\n\n * ADDED:- The Dead marshes\n   \n * ADDED:- Return to Mirkwood "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=639804","commentId":639804,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1338734690,"content":"As always, if you experience problems the fastest way to fix is to just delete the entire Plugin Dir and just download it again form the server … just remember to backup your player decks.. so Del this dir!!

Thanks man\n\n\n\nHi Tragic.\nI have tested your new update and it's just awesome the way you can now play two player at the same side of the table. But I have some problems after you added the latest custom quests. Now when I load my older decks or save games it's all screwed up. Heroes get exchanged with encounter cards and quest cards and the like. I have deleted the plugin severel times but it's stil the same. Also, I think you misunderstood me in my earlier post. My point was that in your videos when you use the helper card you can use the number \"1\" both in turn 1 , 1 will power or 1 threat. But when I do it it's just blank. Nothing happens until I get to \"2\".\n\nKind regs and looking forward to getting the Dwerowdwelf AP's when it's legal around sep/oct"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=670196","commentId":670196,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1344364135,"content":"I strongly recommend you simply delete the plugin folder and then do a fresh install form the menu… This will fix all these \"issues\"\n\nmr.thomasschmidt said:\n\nlso, the problem with the helper card is still there. Don't know if you got my note about it last time, but here it is again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] The helper card values doesn't ever show up when it's 1. You won't see turn 1, will 1 or threat 1. When you get to 2 and more it's okay but for some reason the 1 doesn't show.\n\nLackeyCCG is a native Mac application in fact.. so that has no affect.\n\nStill what you are seeing here is the fact that I am using these tokens in a way that is not strictly the way it was designed. The way LackeyCCG works is that you add one token and it shows an image of the token, then you add a 2nd token and it puts a number on top of that image.. as there are NO tokens for those helper values witch you use on the helper card .. number 1 is always invisible.. there is no immediate way around this… and I have nvr considered it a problem to be bothered fixing.. though I have an idea of a way I can adjust this if it is a real pain.. but as I said.. i do not think it is a issue..\n\nmr.thomasschmidt said:\n\nBut it seems there's a problem regarding save games. After update when I load a saved game it's all screwed up. Like Heroes replaced with quest and encounter deck cards from the custom quest cards. I have deleted and reinstalled the plugin severel times now but it's the same every time. The save games are ok in the old version but everytime I update they gets all screwed up. And it's the same cards that are replaced/replacing the cards every time. Any ideas why? Of cause I can play with the old version and just use the plugininfo.txt from the new update but it would be nice if it could be fixed for the future, as I also have to copy all custom cards manually. And I'll miss any other changes made prbably. And I like to collect so I try to have all cards in all 4 resolutions all time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI didn't want to implement any deletion stuff into the update as many people like to mod the plugin to add there own stuff.. If those icons are still showing in the token area it is as the images are there from the last time you installed it. This doesn't effect it at all.It seems there's a problem regarding save games.

There was some changes to the card names themselves in some cases to allow for the use of cards that have the exact same name (way to go FFG lol) .. so these might be the cards you have that are acting wrong.\n\nStill save games work.. just make new ones. I do not think you will be able to load your older save games is all.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=670308","commentId":670308,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1344388820,"content":" Okay, got it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'll try the update again and make a save game through this new update and see what happens.

Darrowdelf has started… so get on and start hitting the trail\n\n \n\n\nAlso, I have made some pretty major changes to the plugin. I Strongly recommend backing up your OWN decks and DELETING THE ENTIRE PLUGIN DIR AND INSTALLING FROM SCRATCH.\n\n \n\nI have added 2 new deck zones… as there are more and more quests that require shuffling of the quest deck. So now you will see that there is a new button called \"DRAW QUEST\" this will draw a quest card form the top of the quest deck (LEFT). You can still play as always, but if you are playing say FLIGHT FROM MORIA, you can now put the quest cards in the quest deck zone and use the shuffle and other deck functions!\n\n \n\nI have also added a new deck zone called \"VICTORY\" so you may drag your victory cards into this area now if you wish.\n\n \n\nAlso ALL the encounter decks have been changed. So i strongly recommend you deleting them all and re-downloading. This is because I have added yet another deck zone called \"ASIDE\". This deck zone contains all the Quest 1a setup cards. Like if the quest says \"search the encounter deck for card and place in staging area\" well that card is now already put aside for you in this aside deck zone. This should speed up quest setup as you will not need to fetch the cards yourself.\n\n \n\nAlso there is a new button in teh canned messages area called \"!mulligan!\" this will discard your starting hand and then draw 6 cards as well as announcing you are taking a mulligan, next to it is !draw 6! that will draw your starting hand.\n\n \n\n \n\nOk have fun!!!\n\n-----------------\n\nAlso I have fixed some problems with the default keybindings … they should now be all working … if not del the plugin and fresh update!\n\n\nCRT+LEFT CLICK = Flip a Card\nHOLD SHIFT + MOUSE OVER (Peak at the other side of the card without flipping it)\n\nF1 = Refresh ALL\nF2 = Draw Card\n\nF3 = Next Phase\nF4 = Last Phase\n\nF5 = Draw Encounter Card\nF6 = Draw Shadow Card\n\nF7 = New Turn\n\n \n\nF9 = Empty Hand - This moves the top card of your hand to the top of your draw deck.

BUT the cards in the 6 month period will have their card text blurred out. This way the plugin will comply with the wishes of the copywrite holders, FFG and people can simply replace the blurred cards with their own scans if they wish. \n \nThis should stop the fracturing of the user base, as many users were running custom versions of this plugin. Now you can just replace the blurred cards and connect with anyone.. no need to write a personalised plugin anymore!\n \n \n \nPlease let me know if anything needs fixing!!\n \n \nAs some of you may know it has been a long time between updates. I was away on holiday for ages, and then I quit this game in favour for other LCGs like Netrunner. \n \nI am looking for someone to take over this plugin and maintain it.\n \nThe plugin itself is complete and I expect it not to need additional work. All anyone needs to do to update this plugin is look in the plugin dir and see the cardlist.txt file. This is a tab delimitered spreadsheet txt file. You can load it in excel or calc or any speadsheet app. Once you do you can clearly see the pattern of how to fill in new cards. \n \nIf anyone wishes to take over the plugin please let me know. PM me on YOUTUBE, BGG, FFG or CARDGAMEDB.\n \nTo those thinking of taking over.. there are TWO options.\n \n1) You take over the entire plugin, including updating and hosting (hosting can be done easy through DropBox.. this is what I am using now). You will need to update the txt file, update the dropbox and update the scans. I can put you in touch with a scanner.\n \nThis is what I am hoping someone will step up and do.\n \n2) The other option is to simply update the cardlist.txt file and email it to me. This is by far the most time consuming part of the update. The data entry. If someone will do this for me. I can host and handle the plugin updates, Until someone wishes to take on the entire show.\n \n \nAnyway..

I am technically on holidays but as I am spending a lot of time on trains and planes and while I had all that time I have been updating the LoTR Plugin on my laptop and playing it a ton...Woot-a-loot-a-lot!\n\nThis is BETA... I'll be doing small tweaks as I play, as I travel. So let me know if there are any problems.. may take a little while to settle down. There is a lot of changes. Still everything is going well and it is now fully uptodate with the current release.. apart form the 3 new nightmares that I will add when I get some time. Remember the 6 month wait thing going on for cards that FFG ask for.. I'm still honouring their wishes in this matter.\n\nFor Detailed Install Instructions see the bottom of the Post... for the rest... here is the Plugin Link!.. just copy the link (right click copy url) and paste it into the LackeyCCG plugin installer.\n\nLord of the Rings: The Card Game (LCG) - LackeyCCG Plugin Version 6 [http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9169569/LackeyCCG/LoTR-LCG/updatelist.txt]\n\nHave Fun and ROLL HIGH\n--Tragic\n \n\nYOU WILL NEED TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE OLD PLUGIN FOLDER AND REINSTALL\n- This is nearly a full re-write of the plugin -\n\n!! Use latest version of LackeyCCG !!\n\n\nREMOVED COMPLETELY\n\n\n * Time is a real issue for me nowadays and the data entry of this plugin is a chore that borders on work. I do not know how Trevor dose it programing the LackeyCCG himself. He is a saint. To that end. I will NO LONGER be entering all the physical data for the 100s of cards beyond the Name, Number of Copies and Sphere / Encounter set / Type. This is all the info you need to build decks in game, though I would recommend using Zorbec's Deck Builder [http://eric.minet.free.fr/lotrbuilder/dbdownl_en.htm] anyway. This will massively reduce the work load for me and increase my will to get off my butt and do a release! If anyone wants to finish the data entry for me on the provided files I will add it to the official release\n * I have completely dispensed with the various resolutions. Now everything is MAX resolution only.\n * I've changed the naming convention for the Encounter decks. I think this way is much better\n   * All decks have a full stop at the start. This will ensure they are all grouped at the top of the file list and any new decks will be below them\n   * All decks are numbered near the order of the original release scheduled. The pattern seams to be \"Deluxe Expansion, 6x Adventure Packs, Print on Demand, Saga\" Nightmare and Easy Mode decks will also follow the same order. There are no Easy or Nightmare versions of Print on Demand decks so far\n   * \"Normal\" decks have no letter in front of them.\n   * \"Easy Mode\" decks all have the Letter \"E\" at the start\n   * \"Nightmare\" decks all have the letter \"N\" at the start\n   * \"Custom Quests\" decks all have \"Custom\" at the start\n\n\nCHANGES\n\n\n * I have removed completely the various resolutions. Now everything is MAX.\n * I have adjusted all the Quest Cards in a way so that they now scale with the Lackey Card Viewer. So you can scale the quest cards like any other using the viewer. This uses PNG files and can make using your own replacements harder to construct, but as they are just Quest cards this is a small problem as you own the cards already right? See below for more details.\n   I have re-built form scratch ALL the encounter decks... Easy, Normal, Nightmare and Customs. There may be some errors even though I was careful.. please let me know if you find any.\n * A number of cards have had slight name tweaks to make them unique (Lackey can not handle non-unique card names). All cards should load correctly now. Zorbec will take my name changes into account during his next update to retain compatibility with the Lackey export function.\n * All custom cards now have CUSTOM before their name, and other major deck builder values so they are extremely easy to see and not get confused with official sets.\n * The keyboard functions have been changed. Make sure you read the keyboard layout section of the post or go into options/keybindings and set them to your own desires.\n * The 3 Helper Card Tokens are now normal \"extra\" tokens that appear on the bottom right side of the a tall card. This is so you now have a total of 6 generic tokens to use as you will on all cards rather than only 3 like before (not including Resources, Questing and Wounds)\n * The \"Helper Card\" to match the new tokens. It is now vertical and sized so the new position of the helper tokens fit on it.\n\nADDED\n\n\n * Against the Shadow 2/6 : The Drúadan Forest\n * Against the Shadow 3/6 : Encounter at Amon Dîn\n * Against the Shadow 4/6 : Assault on Osgiliath\n * Against the Shadow 5/6 : The Blood of Gondor\n * Against the Shadow 6/6 : The Morgul Vale\n * Saga Explanation 3: The Lord of the Rings 1/?? : The Black Riders\n * Nightmare : Passage though Mirkwood\n * Nightmare : Journey down the Anduin\n * Nightmare : Escape from Dol Guldur\n * Print on Demand 3 - The Stone of Erech\n * Constructed a LoTR Theme to go with the plugin and the new skinning features of LackeyCCG.\n * Custom : The Will of Isengard (WoI : Part 1/?)\n * Custom : A New Power is Rising (WoI: Part 2/?)\n\nNO LONGER CENSORED\n\n * Against the Shadow 2/6 : The Drúadan Forest\n * Against the Shadow 3/6 : Encounter at Amon Dîn\n * Against the Shadow 4/6 : Assault on Osgiliath\n * Nightmare : Passage though Mirkwood\n * Nightmare : Journey down the Anduin\n * Nightmare : Escape from Dol Guldur\n\n\nUNCENSORING SCHEDULED\n\n * Saga Explanation 3: The Lord of the Rings 1/?? : The Black Riders\n   * Released: 9/13\n   * Uncensored: 3/14\n * Against the Shadow 5/6 : The Blood of Gondor\n   * Released: 10/13\n   * Uncensored: 4/14\n * Print on Demand 3 - The Stone of Erech\n   * Released: 10/13\n   * Uncensored: 04/14\n * Against the Shadow 6/6 : The Morgul Vale\n   * Released: 11/13\n   * Uncensored: 05/14\n\n\nKeyBoard Functions\n\nYou can set your own keyboard functions to anything you wish, by clicking PREFERENCES button and then clicking KEYBINDINGS. These are just what I use. Feel free to change ANY button but the F!! and the F12.. if you change these you will break some of the scripting functions. Remember you can always update form the url at any time to reset everything to defaults.\n\nKeybindings in Lackey are pervasive across the application, so if you use \"t\" for take control, then every time you type \"t\" in the chat window it will trigger the hotkey. So I am using SHIFT+T and CTRL+T to turn On and Off tokens. There is a bug in LackeyCCG at the moment that makes windows systems beep if you use ALT+t.... so for now it is SHIFT+T.. but will go back to ALT once the bug is fixed.\n\nCRT+LEFT CLICK = Flip a Card\nHOLD SHIFT + MOUSE OVER (Peak at the other side of the card without flipping it)\n\nF1 = Refresh ALL\nF2 = Draw Card\n\n] = Next Phase (auto save each advanced phase)\n[ = Last Phase\nF4 = Advance Turn\n\nF3 = Draw Quest Card\nF5 = Draw Encounter Card\nF6 = Draw Shadow Card\nF7 = Draw 2nd Encounter Card\nF8 = Draw 2nd Shadow Card\n\nF12 = Empty Hand - This moves the top card of your hand to the top of your draw deck. (do not change this keybinding!!)\n\nSHIFT+T = Take Control of Card\n\nSHIFT+Q / CRT+Q = Resource Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+W / CRT+W = Wound Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+E / CRT+E = Quest Token (Add / Remove)\n\nSHIFT+A / CRT+A = Yellow Generic Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+S / CRT+S = Red Generic Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+D / CRT+D = Purple Generic Token (Add / Remove)\n\nSHIFT+Z / CRT+Z = Blue Generic Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+X / CRT+X = Cross Generic Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+C / CRT+C = Green Generic Token (Add / Remove)\n\nCTRL+1 = Toggle Draw Mode ON / OFF\nCTRL+2 = Clear Drawn Markings\n\nSHIFT+R = Roll 6 sided Dice\nSHIFT+F = Flip Coin\n\nFor the record I change the hotkeys so they do not use the SHIFT modifiers, as I always use a voice communication and never use the chat window anyway.\n\n\nThere is are some helpful BUTTONS near the chat window.\n\nSAVE - Save the current state of the game\nLOAD - Load saved game\nDRAW 6 - Shuffle your deck, then draw 6 Cards, then announce in chat you are drawing your star hand\nMulligan - Announce a Mulligan, then discard hand, shuffle deck, draw 6 cards\n\nUseful Console Commands\n\nRemember lackeyCCG has a huge list of console commands to let you do awesome stuff... see the full list at lackeyccg.com [http://www.lackeyccg.com/tutoriallogcommands.html]! Though here are some real useful ones!\n\n/save NameYouChoose (Save the current game, includes all decks)\n/load NameYouChoose (Load a save game)\n/senddeck # (This command will send you deck to the other player and download it directly to their deck folder, replace the # with their seat number.. so if their name is 3rd in the list it would be \"/senddeck 3\"\n\n\nDetailed Set up Instructions\n\nAfter download and install the application, Click the PLUGIN tab at the top of the screen.\nUntitled_2.jpg [http://s3.postimg.org/f3i6kqo8z/Untitled_2.jpg]\n\nNow copy this link: Lord of the Rings: The Card Game (LCG) - LackeyCCG Plugin Version 6 [http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9169569/LackeyCCG/LoTR-LCG/updatelist.txt]\n\nUse \"right click / copy link\" to do this.\n\nBack in lackey click the \"Paste Auto Update URL\" and it will be pasted in.. then click the INSTALL BUTTON.\nUntitled_3.jpg [http://s28.postimg.org/mz352lrrx/Untitled_3.jpg]\n\nThat is it.. the plug in will now work!!

Plugin should install!\n- The iPad context menu should now show a \"FLIP\" card function.\n- Missing ReadMe.txt file that is causing problems on iPad version\n- Phase 4 sound file is now fixed!\n\nAdded\n\n- The Voice of Isengard\n- Nightmare: Mirwood 1/6 - The Hunt for Gollum\n- Nightmare: Mirwood 2/6 - Conflict at the Carrock\n- Nightmare: Mirwood 3/6 - A Journey to Rhosgobel\n- Nightmare: Mirwood 4/6 - The Hills of Emyn Muil\n- Nightmare: Mirwood 5/6 - The Dead Marshes\n- Nightmare: Mirwood 6/6 - Return to Mirkwood\n\n- Some buttons to automatically peak at your deck. 3 Buttons to peak at 1,3,5\n- Some buttons to automatically scry encounter deck 1. 3 Buttons to peak at 1,2,3\n\nKeyBoard Functions\n\nYou can set your own keyboard functions to anything you wish, by clicking PREFERENCES button and then clicking KEYBINDINGS. These are just what I use. Feel free to change ANY button but the F!! and the F12.. if you change these you will break some of the scripting functions. Remember you can always update form the url at any time to reset everything to defaults.\n\nKeybindings in Lackey are pervasive across the application, so if you use \"t\" for take control, then every time you type \"t\" in the chat window it will trigger the hotkey. So I am using SHIFT+T and CTRL+T to turn On and Off tokens. There is a bug in LackeyCCG at the moment that makes windows systems beep if you use ALT+t.... so for now it is SHIFT+T.. but will go back to ALT once the bug is fixed.\n\nCRT+LEFT CLICK = Flip a Card\nHOLD SHIFT + MOUSE OVER (Peak at the other side of the card without flipping it)\n\nF1 = Refresh ALL\nF2 = Draw Card\n\n] = Next Phase (auto save each advanced phase)\n[ = Last Phase\nF4 = Advance Turn\n\nF3 = Draw Quest Card\nF5 = Draw Encounter Card\nF6 = Draw Shadow Card\nF7 = Draw 2nd Encounter Card\nF8 = Draw 2nd Shadow Card\n\nF12 = Empty Hand - This moves the top card of your hand to the top of your draw deck. (do not change this keybinding!!)\n\nSHIFT+T = Take Control of Card\n\nSHIFT+Q / CRT+Q = Resource Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+W / CRT+W = Wound Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+E / CRT+E = Quest Token (Add / Remove)\n\nSHIFT+A / CRT+A = Yellow Generic Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+S / CRT+S = Red Generic Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+D / CRT+D = Purple Generic Token (Add / Remove)\n\nSHIFT+Z / CRT+Z = Blue Generic Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+X / CRT+X = Cross Generic Token (Add / Remove)\nSHIFT+C / CRT+C = Green Generic Token (Add / Remove)\n\nCTRL+1 = Toggle Draw Mode ON / OFF\nCTRL+2 = Clear Drawn Markings\n\nSHIFT+R = Roll 6 sided Dice\nSHIFT+F = Flip Coin\n\nFor the record I change the hotkeys so they do not use the SHIFT modifiers, as I always use a voice communication and never use the chat window anyway.\n\n\nThere is are some helpful BUTTONS near the chat window.\n\nSAVE - Save the current state of the game\nLOAD - Load saved game\nDRAW 6 - Shuffle your deck, then draw 6 Cards, then announce in chat you are drawing your star hand\nMulligan - Announce a Mulligan, then discard hand, shuffle deck, draw 6 cards\nChoose - Picks a random player as 1st player\nScry # - Peak at the top cards of encounter deck 1\nPeak # - Peak at the top cards of your player deck\n\nRefresh - This is hotkeyed for Mac and Pc users to F1 by default, but iPad users... use this button to refresh. It will also raise your threat +1 and draw a new card in a single action.\n\nUseful Console Commands\n\nRemember lackeyCCG has a huge list of console commands to let you do awesome stuff... see the full list at lackeyccg.com [http://www.lackeyccg.com/tutoriallogcommands.html]! Though here are some real useful ones!\n\n/save NameYouChoose (Save the current game, includes all decks)\n/load NameYouChoose (Load a save game)\n/senddeck # (This command will send you deck to the other player and download it directly to their deck folder, replace the # with their seat number.. so if their name is 3rd in the list it would be \"/senddeck 3\"\n\n\nDetailed Set up Instructions\n\nAfter download and install the application, Click the PLUGIN tab at the top of the screen.\nUntitled_2.jpg [http://s3.postimg.org/f3i6kqo8z/Untitled_2.jpg]\n\nNow copy this link: Lord of the Rings: The Card Game (LCG) - LackeyCCG Plugin Version 6 [http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9169569/LackeyCCG/LoTR-LCG/updatelist.txt]\n\nUse \"right click / copy link\" to do this.\n\nBack in lackey click the \"Paste Auto Update URL\" and it will be pasted in.. then click the INSTALL BUTTON.\nUntitled_3.jpg [http://s28.postimg.org/mz352lrrx/Untitled_3.jpg]\n\nThat is it.. the plug in will now work!! All you need to do is tweak a few things to get the most out of it...\n\nOptional Tweaks After Install\n\nMake sure you go into preferences / player profile and set up your server user name and choose a avatar. Otherwise you can not play multiplayer\nimage.jpg [http://s29.postimg.org/8039ryh2f/image.jpg]\n\nIn Appearence, UNTICK \"Mark Card Viewer Image Pop Out on Mouse Over\"\nUntitled_5.jpg [http://s27.postimg.org/f4az6rbo3/Untitled_5.jpg]\n\nIn Performance set it to HIGH!\nUntitled_7.jpg [http://s27.postimg.org/9rm4smnrn/Untitled_7.jpg]\n\nIn Miscellaneous set the tick boxes to this image!\nimage.jpg [http://s29.postimg.org/xy6vxzmjr/image.jpg]\n\n\nwell that it is.. hope you have fun guys!\n\nHave Fun and ROLL HIGH\n--Tragic Edited October 6, 2014 by TragicTheBlathering"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=1290314","commentId":1290314,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1412633270,"content":"I found this the other day (the ipad version)... was pleasantly surprised... and then downloaded  it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nNice Work!\n\nEdited October 6, 2014 by chuckles"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=1290803","commentId":1290803,"userName":"rekath16","timestamp":1412674165,"content":"I admire your efforts for that Programm.

(Changed 2nd green token to pink)\n\nChanged\n\n- Removed \"Hover\" Button. I do not think anyone uses it.\n- All buttons have been abbreviated to Initials to save screen space for iPad versions.

To filter by set simply click the \"SET\" button.. I think it is the 2nd button on the list and type in CORE or w/e and only CORE cards will be seen.\n\nUnfortunately you can not add multiple filters. So you can not filter CORE + RTM as far as I know.\n\nYour best bet is to use Zorbec's Awesome Deckbuilder. It is a must IMO for LoTR Fans and beats the hell out of all the online things. It has export for Lackey built in and also OCTGN (but I do not use OCTGN so haven't tested it)\n\nZorbec's Deck Builder - http://eric.minet.free.fr/lotrbuilder/index_en.htm [http://eric.minet.free.fr/lotrbuilder/index_en.htm]\n\n(Send him a few bucks donations he is a legend of the LCG community for like the last 10 years!)\n\nEdited October 31, 2015 by TragicTheBlathering"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57275-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-for-lackeyccg-play-it-online-with-mates/?do=findComment&comment=1873684","commentId":1873684,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1446350552,"content":"> Yes, I will be updating the LackeyCCG plugin soon... as well as releasing two versions.. one for iPad with the abbreviated buttons and one for desktops with the longer button names.
