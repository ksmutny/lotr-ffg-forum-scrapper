The only really good card you would miss would be Rivendell Blade. The two Heroes from those packs are fun but were designed to be used together, so you're kinda only missing out on one thing there.\n\nOut of the Wild is huge for Victory Display decks (an archetype that is developed later in the game).\n\nTimely Aid is great in Secrecy decks, but not the only way to go in Secrecy decks.\n\nThe other player cards in those two packs range from okay/situational to outright bad.\n\nIf you imagine yourself wanting the full card pool some day, I wouldn't skip those packs if you can find them in stock. But if you are trying to be tactical about your choices, those are good packs to skip."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279480-dwarrowdelf-cycle-skipping-first-two-packs/?do=findComment&comment=3410418","commentId":3410418,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1532052310,"content":"On the plus side, you'll never experience the horror that is Sleeping Sentry.  That's my second most hated card ever.  (I hate Power of Mordor more).\n\nThe first two packs in the AP are a separate trip than the last four packs, so it won't even harm the storyline significantly by skipping the first two packs.\n\nSpirit Bofur from Redhorn Gate is one of my favorite spirit allies, as he can easily be cheated into play for one resource.  Lure of Moria from Road to Rivendell is amazingly powerful with a dwarven swarm, though if the swarm is already out you probably don't need the help."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279480-dwarrowdelf-cycle-skipping-first-two-packs/?do=findComment&comment=3410593","commentId":3410593,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1532070573,"content":"Yes there is an encounter set that you would not use if you don't buy those 2 APs. But it is not a big deal. There is also plenty encounter set that you probably have to discover in the others cycle. And there are way better, both from scenario and player cards (to me cycle 2 is the worst part of the game, and those 2 are the worst part of the cycle 2 ^^). So continue your journey, you still can come back in some years to buy the missing part ;)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279480-dwarrowdelf-cycle-skipping-first-two-packs/?do=findComment&comment=3410696","commentId":3410696,"userName":"player1683311","timestamp":1532080868,"content":"I actually think those 2 quests are pretty cool, Redhorn is still one of my favorites.
