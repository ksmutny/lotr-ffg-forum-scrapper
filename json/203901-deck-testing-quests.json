I am looking for quests that don't require special deck building and perhaps ones that can be ranked in ascending order of difficulty. This is for standard mode and I have the Mirkwood, Against the Shadow, Angmar Awakens cycles and Land of Shadow.\n\nSo far I figured I'd start with Passage through Mirkwood and The Hunt for Gollum and go from there...\n\nEdited February 27, 2016 by Ranger of the Force"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203901-deck-testing-quests/?do=findComment&comment=2075010","commentId":2075010,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1456625519,"content":"Journey down the Anduin. Although a core set it can still be somewhat challenging and is usually a good quest to test decks against.\n\nNightmare or Normal Seventh Level. Sounds like you don't have this one though? Good test of whether your deck/s can handle swarms of weaker enemies or in the nightmare version just swarms of enemies in general.\n\nMassing at Osgiliath. Less brutal and has had its fangs trimmed since the card pool has expanded so much but still not an easy quest and the limitations on each quest card, super nasty boss enemy and plenty of threat gains makes this one good for testing decks out as well.\n\nWastes of Eriador is good for testing if a deck can go the distance, that has to be one of the top five longest quests constantly not being able to place progress on turns that it is night. Constant nasty wargs, plenty of direct damage (to test your healing capabilities) through weather effects and lots of sidequests. Threat reduction galore needed for this quest.\n\nA really easy quest but both fun and somewhat useful to try decks out against is Encounter at Amon Din in the against the shadow cycle, it is fun trying to get as few dead villagers as possible and trying to save as many as you can whilst still taking on orcs and managing locations that can receive damage tokens. You can sometimes smash through this quest within just several turns (like literally 3 or 4 turns at times) with powerful decks so this quest is good for testing and seeing just how easily a powerful deck or decks can take down an easier quest like this one.\n\nConflict at the Carrock is a great quest to test your decks against and to measure how well they do against quests with multiple boss enemies.\n\n \n\nThese are just some personal insights I've gained when testing decks myself. There are other quests I would mention but they are from cycles you don't own. Hope this helps!\n\nEdited February 28, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203901-deck-testing-quests/?do=findComment&comment=2075390","commentId":2075390,"userName":"DunedainLoreKeeper","timestamp":1456661557,"content":"In the topic about deck tiers, we discussed testing decks by pitting them against quests with a perticular challenge. Here are some suggestions from me for those challenges:\n\n \n\nBoss battles: Conflict at the Carrock or Morgul Vale\n\nEnemy management: Seventh Level or Wastes of Eriador\n\nLocation management: Hills of Emyn Muil or Stewards Fear\n\nThreat management: Invaiders of Chetwood or Return to Mirkwood\n\n \n\nGeneralist: Journey down the Anduin or Into Ithilien or Wastes of Eriador\n\n \n\nIf you just slapped together a deck and really need to get a feel of it first before going up against tough quests, you could play the 'easy' quests like passage through mirkwood. It is generally easier to see what needs to be improved by playing aginst slightly harder quests, as you'll be confronted with your weaknesses and therefore shown what you need to improve on your deck. But if you like winning, you could do a 'build up' route where you play consecutive quests that slightly increase in difficulty while tinkering in between."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203901-deck-testing-quests/?do=findComment&comment=2075553","commentId":2075553,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1456674767,"content":"For a rising difficulty I would go:\n\n1. Encounter at Amon Din\n\n2. Journey along the Anduin\n\n3. Conflict at the Carrock\n\n4. The Steward's fear\n\n5. Wastes of Eriador\n\n \n\nBonus: Battle of Carn Dum\n\n \n\nAll quests feature a good mix of questing and combat. While Encounter is a cakewalk, fear and wastes can get very though. If you can beat Carn Dum your deck should be good to go up against most quests :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203901-deck-testing-quests/?do=findComment&comment=2075611","commentId":2075611,"userName":"Ranger of the Force","timestamp":1456679242,"content":"Thanks guys for the suggestions.\n\nCalvadur: I think this is what I am looking for.\n\nPsychorocker, Dunedain: Those are some great ideas too!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203901-deck-testing-quests/?do=findComment&comment=2075753","commentId":2075753,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1456688881,"content":"https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/deck-building-101-part-13-testing-a-deck/ [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/deck-building-101-part-13-testing-a-deck/]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203901-deck-testing-quests/?do=findComment&comment=2075811","commentId":2075811,"userName":"Ranger of the Force","timestamp":1456691399,"content":"> https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/deck-building-101-part-13-testing-a-deck/ [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/deck-building-101-part-13-testing-a-deck/]\n\nVery good article, thanks!"}]}
