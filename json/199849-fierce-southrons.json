The first time i played it(two handed!) i was killed outright by around 14 archery damage. I didn't know the Cards and really had to laugh when revealing one archer, two *man of harad* and *two arrows thick in the air*. I shuffeld thouroughly afterwards =)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199849-fierce-southrons/?do=findComment&comment=2006591","commentId":2006591,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1453471848,"content":"I´m with the Duke on this one: actions is meant to encompass more that just the action-action.

With regards to the peril keyword and the treachery card \"Fierce Southrons\" - if the option is chosen where \"each enemy in the staging area makes an immediate attack against you\", can your team mates use their sentinel characters to block for you? The rule for peril is: When a player reveals an encounter card with the Peril keyword, he must resolve the staging of that card on his own without conferring with the other players. The other players cannot take any actions or trigger any responses during the resolution of that card's staging. Thanks\n\n \n\nThe response I got:\n\nThe peril keyword prevents other players from interrupting the staging of Fierce Southrons, but once the attack has been initiated the staging is done. When an enemy makes an attack outside of the combat phase, you observe all the steps of ‘resolving enemy attacks’ and the action windows between each step. So, it is possible for another player to declare a sentinel character as the defender and to take actions in-between those steps.\n\nCheers,\nCaleb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199849-fierce-southrons/?do=findComment&comment=2007465","commentId":2007465,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1453493222,"content":"Hmm.  So not only can you sentinel, but you could still do actions and responses in combat, like Hasty Stroke.  I mean, that feels right to me because otherwise cards like Fierce Southrons could be a quick game ender.  But the wording on Peril has some room for improvement."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199849-fierce-southrons/?do=findComment&comment=2007604","commentId":2007604,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1453497526,"content":"I'm officially giving up on trying to predict what officially rules are regarding vague wording.
