It seems there is an abundance of new stuff heading our way. That is good! But between the Ringmaker cycle in progress with three more packs to go, the recent announcement of new Lost Realms deluxe box, second LoTR saga box on the boat, two special convention expansions on the list, and nightmare packs being released, I am just a bit lost. \n\n \n\nMy local retailers will most likely get it all at some point. But they are not really up to the task with getting the packs right after release dates. I guess the potential increase in sales resulting from having it soon is not material, and does not justify additional efforts on their part to secure early stocking.\n\n \n\nSo in my perfect world I imagined an FFG subscription service where I am being sent each and every expansion as early as release dates allow, and they charge my credit card accordingly.\n\n \n\nI see two obvious problems. Costs would be relatively high, as delivery costs would pile up. Also, the retailers might frown upon such a by-pass to their business, which I imagine in the end could not be so good for FFG products (I would expect local FLGS support and community interaction for various games is an important factor for marketing).\n\n \n\nStill... what do you think? Is it possible? Or maybe it exists already in some form? Or perhaps it is one of those ideas that always comes up once in a while for each and every LCG? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114833-subscription-service/?do=findComment&comment=1225819","commentId":1225819,"userName":"OnkelZorni","timestamp":1409050755,"content":"There are companies offering subscription services for there products so I don't see any reason (apart from logistics) why FFG couldn't do this too"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114833-subscription-service/?do=findComment&comment=1225915","commentId":1225915,"userName":"Caerdowyn","timestamp":1409055115,"content":"teamcovenant.com offers a subscription service for the adventure packs (and other FFG lcg's)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114833-subscription-service/?do=findComment&comment=1226134","commentId":1226134,"userName":"deeth82","timestamp":1409063072,"content":"> teamcovenant.com offers a subscription service for the adventure packs (and other FFG lcg's)\n\nTook the words right out of my mouth. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114833-subscription-service/?do=findComment&comment=1226154","commentId":1226154,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1409063631,"content":"My FLGS keeps me up to date."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114833-subscription-service/?do=findComment&comment=1226591","commentId":1226591,"userName":"raven614","timestamp":1409079272,"content":"I wonder if maybe ffg keeps a better relationship with the lgs by not offering subscriptions.

Good to know.\n\n \n\nWell, that is a shame, really. Not about the delay, but about lack of any communication. Delays happen and it is perfectly understandable that you need to wait few days more. But lack of response across the line is a poor business practice.\n\n \n\nI just I hope this is some kind of technicality rather than a general approach not to care. FFG seemed trustworthy to me so far. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114833-subscription-service/?do=findComment&comment=1256559","commentId":1256559,"userName":"Mich the One","timestamp":1410356836,"content":"OK, my stuff got shipped eventually.
