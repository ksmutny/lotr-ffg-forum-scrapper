I download all of the inserts from the LOTR LCG Support page and have them on my phone and iPad. I throw away everything but the cards. If the new packaging was not sturdy, led to damaged cards, etc., then I would be annoyed. But, as far as I can tell, the new packaging seems comparably durable to the old stuff. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181825-new-packaging/?do=findComment&comment=1683427","commentId":1683427,"userName":"Ryodu","timestamp":1436225391,"content":"If it keeps cost downs I'm happy with it.
