I make my custom sets in an Excel spreadsheet, which is very convenient. Then, there is an Excel macro that generates the necessary OCTGN file. I then have a macro in Strange Eons that takes the OCTGN file and generates the Strange Eons cards, sans images. Then you just have to load in the images by hand* and do a mass Strange Eons export. I have yet another script that will take the exported images and make them into an OCTGN image pack.\n\n*Once you've done this once, you don't need to load in the images by hand all over again if you make changes to the set. There is a second script that will just take all the cards you already made and update the text, leaving the image alone.\n\nI don't have the time right now, but I plan on making a tutorial video of how to do all this. It definitely makes the creation, modification, and playtesting of custom content way easier.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255655-tools-for-combining-strange-eons-and-octgn/?do=findComment&comment=2915975","commentId":2915975,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1502066589,"content":"Generating the OCTGN file automatically would definitely be a huge plus -- manually filling out the xml is horrible..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255655-tools-for-combining-strange-eons-and-octgn/?do=findComment&comment=2917324","commentId":2917324,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1502136654,"content":"> 19 hours ago, Kjeld said:\n> \n> Generating the OCTGN file automatically would definitely be a huge plus -- manually filling out the xml is horrible...\n\nhttps://github.com/GeckoTH/Lord-of-the-Rings/blob/master/LotR set editor.xlsm [https://github.com/GeckoTH/Lord-of-the-Rings/blob/master/LotR%20set%20editor.xlsm]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255655-tools-for-combining-strange-eons-and-octgn/?do=findComment&comment=2917497","commentId":2917497,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1502142454,"content":"Super cool, thank you for developing and sharing this!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255655-tools-for-combining-strange-eons-and-octgn/?do=findComment&comment=2918305","commentId":2918305,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1502199317,"content":"That Excel script, along with most of the LotR plugin in general, is thanks to GeckoTH."}]}
