In the round that Nazgul would engage us, I was able to play Son of Arnor in the planning phase to engage him. Then in the same phase, my partner attached Forest Snare on the Nazgul. Thus we decreased the threat in the staging are by 5 and were able to nullify possibly terrible consequences with Nazgul in the combat stage. I had a feeling this card would be great. I know I may not be using (even when getting it) in every game but then more cards are like that.\n\nWe won the game, do I need to add?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47023-how-cool-son-of-arnor-is-or-can-be/?do=findComment&comment=471124","commentId":471124,"userName":"Vyron2","timestamp":1305779746,"content":"I'm embarrassed to say - but thank you for your post - NOW I get why Son of Arnor is useful... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] also in combo with tactics, where you can declare and resolve an attack via event card... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] and other uses... the card is cool! almost always! you can help out a fellow lore or spirit player, if he became engaged and is helplessly lost... nice!sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47023-how-cool-son-of-arnor-is-or-can-be/?do=findComment&comment=471146","commentId":471146,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1305782231,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\nThen in the same phase, my partner attached Forest Snare on the Nazgul.\n\n\n\nWell, there's your great card. The Forest Snare is the important one. If you had not played the Son of Arnor, what would have been different? You could still have engaged the Nazgul and snared it. The Son of Arnor only allowed you to reduce the threat for one turn, since due to bad timing the Nazgul ended up in your staging area in the planning phase.\n\nHow did that happen anyway? Did you use Legolas and decided to free the prisoner after placing his success tokens for killing an enemy? Normally, the Nazgul enters the staging area after the adventure phase, allowing you to engage the Nazgul right away, before his threat becomes an issue."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47023-how-cool-son-of-arnor-is-or-can-be/?do=findComment&comment=471194","commentId":471194,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1305787145,"content":"jhaelen said:\n\n \n\nlleimmoen said:\n\nYou can only Forest Snare an engaged enemy.

My threat level was not as high and I did not want to engage him myself because I'd have to fight him in the Combat phase.

Solo, his ability becomes much more situational and for a 3 cost, he simply isn't that effective. I've found that when I have him in my hand and could have played him, I held him back just to wait for the right situation, when I could have had another ally in play.
