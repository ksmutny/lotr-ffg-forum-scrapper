Is that correct? So an ally brought in via Sneak Attack could not go questing.\n\n \n\nSecondly, although I hate errata from years and years of playing card games, I really feel Sneak Attack needs to be changed so that it can not be used to bring in Gandalf.. something to the affect of being able to target non-Istari allies or something like that. Cost vs Benefit ratio makes Sneak Attack plus Gandalf too good, in my opinion. Lower threat by 5? That costs nearly 3 resources for the Spirit sphere. Draw 3 cards. That costs lore 3 resources. I understand its a two card combo, but on top of his ability he makes for a really good attacker/defender as well. What do you guys think?\n\n \n\n \n\nRyan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52724-sneak-attack-question-and-sneak-attack-gandalf-opinion/?do=findComment&comment=524476","commentId":524476,"userName":"player582283","timestamp":1315243214,"content":"I play that you can Sneak Attack in an ally in the Quest phase and commit him.  The rationale is that the Players Commit characters to quest bullet on page 30 is in green (players can take actions in between the steps).  If I recall, someone said there is an example in the FAQ that supports this, but I'm not motivated enough to look in the FAQ right now.\n\nI think the Gandalf - Sneak Attack combo is powerful, but I don't think it requires errata.  There are several powerful combos and many will evolve over time - that's the nature of the game.  If you feel it is too strong, simply house rule it with your group - especially easy if you play solo!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52724-sneak-attack-question-and-sneak-attack-gandalf-opinion/?do=findComment&comment=524483","commentId":524483,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1315245686,"content":"I also have always played it that you can commit a character played with Sneak Attack in the very first action window of the phase. \n\nI don't find Sneak Attack/Gandalf to be currently overpowered.

This phase is broken into three steps: 1) commit characters, 2) staging, and 3) quest resolution. Players have the opportunity to take actions and play event cards at the end of each step.\"\n\nThis rule states that at the end of the step in which you commit characters, actions and events may be played.  It does specifically prohibit a player from playing an action or event before characters are committed.\n\nThe Unofficial FAQ, it states:\n\n\"51. When can cards be played during questing? The rulebook P.14 states that cards can be played at the end of each step, where the game flows at the back of the rule book states card canbe played generally during green steps\n\nThe games flows are accurate. Cards can be played at any point during a green step in the game flows. The statement on P.14 is referring specifically to red steps when actions can only be played at the end of the step\"\n\nThis refers to the text on pg 30 concerning the flow:\n\n• Red – Players cannot interrupt with actions.\nResponses can be played if their conditions are met.\n\n• Green – Any player can take actions generally, or\nbetween the game steps stated in the rules.\n\nI prefer to see it as I would any CCG where it must be broken down further - because of competitive tournament play - to: Start of Phase 3 -> Players may take actions and play events -> Commit characters -> Players may take actions and play events, etc.\n\nI'll keep having having Galdalf doing Sneak Attacks straight to quest until the Official FAQ says different.  Honestly, I don't think it would change the game either way.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52724-sneak-attack-question-and-sneak-attack-gandalf-opinion/?do=findComment&comment=524541","commentId":524541,"userName":"Bonus Card","timestamp":1315257996,"content":"Kevenliev said:\n\nTitan said:\n\n \n\nI also have always played it that you can commit a character played with Sneak Attack in the very first action window of the phase. \n\nI don't find Sneak Attack/Gandalf to be currently overpowered.

I think there could be a window of opportunity for Actions between players committing characters during a multi-player game. The fact that Theodred's ability wouldn't be able to place a resource token on a Hero that was committed by a player who came after the Theodred player seems to indicate that there is a timing gap between the two players as they commit characters.\n\n * Player One commits characters for questing and then fires off any abilities in the order of their choosing (Theodred + Aragorn, etc.)\n * Argument that Actions can be played somewhere in here.\n * Player Two commits characters for questing...\n\nPlus things start going down faster when playing with a group that is comfortable with the flow of the game so some events might be hitting the table due to eager hands and it might slow things down to start telling people they need to wait till the end of the step. This would probably only really become an issue if something really tipped the balance of the game if it was played between players committing characters. We're all pretty sure that Sneak Attack+Gandalf can already happen at the beginning of the Quest Phase anyway. So I personally wouldn't have a problem if someone I was playing with changed their mind and decided to bust him out between players committing characters instead of at the beginning of the phase. Go team!\n\nI can't think off the top of my head of any currently released Events or Actions that would cause an issue if they were played between players committing characters rather than before or after everyone committed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52724-sneak-attack-question-and-sneak-attack-gandalf-opinion/?do=findComment&comment=525072","commentId":525072,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1315366840,"content":"radiskull said:\n\n This is incorrect.  From the FAQ:\n\n\"A player commits all characters he wishes to commit to a quest at once.
