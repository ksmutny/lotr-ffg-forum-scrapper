Now I am setting up the 'Escape from Dol Guldur' adventure.\n\nMy initial draw from the encounter deck to attach to the 3 objective cards was as follows:\n\n1 enemy, 1 treachery and 1 location\n\nThe enemy and location make sense as how I would claim the objectives, but I am not clear on how to resolve the treachery? Do I just draw again until I get a non-treachery card?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64212-attaching-encounter-cards-to-objectives/?do=findComment&comment=627479","commentId":627479,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1336428622,"content":" Nope.  You resolve the treachery card and then you've got an unguarded objective."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64212-attaching-encounter-cards-to-objectives/?do=findComment&comment=627784","commentId":627784,"userName":"CreepyBastard","timestamp":1336478746,"content":"So the treachery resolves during the Setup?\n\nDo enemy cards resolve their When Revealed effects during the setup as well?
