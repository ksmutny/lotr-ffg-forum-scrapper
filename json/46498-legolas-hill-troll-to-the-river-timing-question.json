There is no active location. Legolas participates in an attack that kills the Hill Troll. Does quest advancement happen before of after I'm allowed to use Legolas's response?\n\nIf before: To the River increases to 10 progress tokens, then advancement, then Anduin Passage stays at 0 progress.\n\nIf after: To the River stays at 8 progress tokens, then advancement, then Legolas adds 2 progress tokens to Anduin Passage.\n\n \n\nDoes the rulebook support either scenario?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46498-legolas-hill-troll-to-the-river-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=465445","commentId":465445,"userName":"Bray","timestamp":1304886604,"content":"Meh.

I can see where the confusion comes from though, since you could easily argue the other point."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46498-legolas-hill-troll-to-the-river-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=465557","commentId":465557,"userName":"fabest","timestamp":1304917080,"content":" The quest is completed immediately, so Legolas counters will be put on the new one.\n\nLegolas ability waits until the end of the combat phase, and so occurs after the change of quest.\n\nThis has been ruled like that on the french official forums."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46498-legolas-hill-troll-to-the-river-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=465584","commentId":465584,"userName":"Bray","timestamp":1304922672,"content":"fabest said:\n\nLegolas ability waits until the end of the combat phase.\n\nThanks for the update from the French forums, but I find the part I quoted highly unlikely."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46498-legolas-hill-troll-to-the-river-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=465605","commentId":465605,"userName":"fabest","timestamp":1304925893,"content":" Yes, forget this part sorry :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n "}]}
