I mean take a look at Silverload Archer, it's very different stylistically from many of the other pieces but it still works great.\n\nAlso, many artists paint digitally these days and it doesn't take away from the skill or beauty of their work.\n\nThere are a FEW pieces in the game that I've not been happy with, but those are mainly hero pictures, which I hold to a higher standard (I'm looking at you Brand and Boromir) but for the most part this game's art is amazing!

I MUCH prefer card games to have a large variety of styles and looks.The individual cards to do not need to look the same as the other cards.. imo this just makes the entire game start to look booring and dull.. a variety of styles gives the art life and starts to split the players artistic taste to have true favs rather then them all being the same.\n\nimo, LoTR is to harmoginous , and needs some cool \"fresh\" artists to add some new looks.\n\n "}]}
