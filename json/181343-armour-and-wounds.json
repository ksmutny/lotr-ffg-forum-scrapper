Can a healer heal wounds that were attributed to the plate? Thematically, I guess not. I think it would add too much bookkeeping, and it was just simplified to add hit points for the sake of gameplay. I guess I think of the plate absorbing part of the impact of each hit, so it takes more hits to bring my hero down.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181343-armour-and-wounds/?do=findComment&comment=1674570","commentId":1674570,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1435522718,"content":"Yes good point.\n\nThe mechanics of this game work so well thematically that its nice to tie up loose ends sometimes :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181343-armour-and-wounds/?do=findComment&comment=1675020","commentId":1675020,"userName":"jnicol","timestamp":1435578720,"content":"I think you are correct that when Citadel Plate is removed any damage beyond the hero's HP remains on the hero and immediately kills them.

Eg Card one give breastplate and groin whereas card two gives arms and legs.\n\nEdited June 29, 2015 by alexbobspoons"}]}
