If you use this event and Bilbo has 1 attack point, then Aragorn will attack with 4 attack points finally.\n\n \n\nPD: if Bilbo has attached Sting, then he has 2 attack, defense and willpower points. And if he has attached Mithril he has 3wp points. Not bad then.\n\nEdited June 27, 2014 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109547-the-lucky-number/?do=findComment&comment=1135773","commentId":1135773,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1403897145,"content":"Thanks a lot! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
