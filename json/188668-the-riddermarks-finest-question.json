The player card states that you can add 2 progress to any LOCATION, if only 1 is required then the other progress token is discard/wasted and does not overflow onto the quest.  It does not use the general rule of questing as you are not questing and it can happen at any time you can use an action not just during the quest phase. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188668-the-riddermarks-finest-question/?do=findComment&comment=1800645","commentId":1800645,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1442456192,"content":"In short, the two tokens are placed at the same time, meaning the location has 4 progress out of 3 quest points and is then discarded."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188668-the-riddermarks-finest-question/?do=findComment&comment=1800655","commentId":1800655,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1442456428,"content":"You're just looking at it backwards, Gandalf196.   When you quest, the only reason you're putting progress on the location is because the location is blocking the quest.  Clear the location, and your hard won progress-- which was intended to be placed on the quest in the first place -- is allowed to go there.  With a card like The Riddermark's Finest, your target is the location itself, not the quest card, so there is no rule in place that would designate extra progress going onto the quest card once you clear the location."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188668-the-riddermarks-finest-question/?do=findComment&comment=1800720","commentId":1800720,"userName":"Gandalf196","timestamp":1442458824,"content":"Wow, thanks for the clarification people!
