Some people were mad about the LCG idea being \"destroyed, \" which I didn't agree with. I was actually concerned about the health of LotR when it they announced it would not have rotation. But something I realized is that all LCGs that were scheduled for rotation are gone.\n\nWarhammer Invasion was discontinued\n\nW40KC was discontinued\n\nStar Wars was discontinued (just before rotation was scheduled, no less!)\n\nAndroid Netrunner got a second edition (granted, just after the first scheduled rotation)\n\nGame of Thrones got a second edition on rotation announcement\n\nArkham Horror and L5R were released post-rotation\n\nSo was it actually good that LotR never got rotation? Any thoughts? Is this crazy?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271814-lotr-and-other-lcgs-rotation/?do=findComment&comment=3254127","commentId":3254127,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1521487261,"content":"Call of Cthulhu never got rotation BTW."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271814-lotr-and-other-lcgs-rotation/?do=findComment&comment=3254153","commentId":3254153,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1521488084,"content":"A:NR isn't a second edition.

None of the rules changed, just a different Core Set.\n\nAlso, Core 2.0 essentially represents a somewhat modified rotation, where they saved a certain set of cards from rotating out, and conversely force-rotated out some cards that were in Core 1.0. It made a lot of sense for a game that was not initially designed with rotation in mind. But overall, yes, the game has undergone rotation (to its benefit, I think most of its competitive community would agree)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271814-lotr-and-other-lcgs-rotation/?do=findComment&comment=3254338","commentId":3254338,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1521495994,"content":"All of those things are true, but I just thought it was interesting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271814-lotr-and-other-lcgs-rotation/?do=findComment&comment=3254345","commentId":3254345,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1521496384,"content":"LOTR rotation is..... possible? That's more like a self-imposed deck-building challenge. \"Use only cards from cycles X, Y, and Z, to beat quest W.\" You have to consider that most, if not all, quests, at least non-Saga, were designed with the full player cardpool in mind. So if you artificially restrict yourself, the encounter deck is built with the expectation that you have access to certain tools, and if you don't have them, you're going to be in for a more difficult experience.\n\nPlus imagine the uproar if they try to limit which cycles are allowed at Fellowship events.

Just agree among your player group if you want to restrict deck building or not. Many players enjoy thematic plays which is a strong restriction as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271814-lotr-and-other-lcgs-rotation/?do=findComment&comment=3254801","commentId":3254801,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1521549558,"content":"Again, I agree with you (now at least) that LotR is better without rotation.

For the same reason, I think having some 'pre-built' competitive decks for sale is important too. Being able to try a competitive deck for a lowish-fixed cost, gets new players into the game and without having to get their head around every card.\n\nNone of that really applies to co-op games though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271814-lotr-and-other-lcgs-rotation/?do=findComment&comment=3261446","commentId":3261446,"userName":"cheapmate","timestamp":1522051951,"content":"They most likely ended Call of Cthulhu (still sad for that one) and Star Wars when they did in order to avoid the hassle that rotation gives for a game that was ending anyway.\n\nLikewise AGOT received its new edition when it did for the same reason.\n\nRotation for coop games isn’t required as you can restrict yourself to any cards you feel like.\n\nI would not be against having (thematic) restrictions during event play however."}]}
