If you are playing 2 or 3 events per round, your hand will get emptied even with the contract’s draw effect, and other draw effects coming out of your deck are unreliable since it’s a singleton deck.\n\n-include many 0 and 1 cost events so you can trigger the contract’s responses often, and for profit.\n\n-build the deck without expectation that there is any particular card that you MUST draw. Instead, include multiple cards that fill the same role. Then you can expect a particular ROLE to be filled, even if the exact card filling that role differs in each game. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306813-council-of-the-wise-contract-how-to/?do=findComment&comment=3912995","commentId":3912995,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1584047751,"content":"> 21 minutes ago, GrandSpleen said:\n> \n> -include heroes who can draw cards for you.

And give preference to events you know you'll play in the round that you get them. Could view the contract as a resource generator. Only 1 copy of will of the west, so its utility will be highly dependent on when you draw it.  \n\nWhen I built for this contract, I avoided traits as I don't think the council contract supports the typical established deckbuilding approaches (like: \"I'm making a Noldor deck\"). I thought you'd end up getting spread too thin by restricting yourself to a trait-based approach. But some people have proven me wrong, I think there's a nice Rohan-themed deck on ringsdb right now. So go for it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306813-council-of-the-wise-contract-how-to/?do=findComment&comment=3913503","commentId":3913503,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1584113778,"content":"I tried to put something together\n\nhttps://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14880/thewisenoldor-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14880/thewisenoldor-1.0]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306813-council-of-the-wise-contract-how-to/?do=findComment&comment=3913900","commentId":3913900,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1584157586,"content":"Cool!
