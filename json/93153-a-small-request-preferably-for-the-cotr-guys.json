That art is completely amazing, so I looked for it high and low but could not find the image of either the card nor the art. Does anyone have a digital image of the fan-made card who can post it here please? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93153-a-small-request-preferably-for-the-cotr-guys/?do=findComment&comment=912845","commentId":912845,"userName":"GeckoTH","timestamp":1384933632,"content":"Yeah, the card was made by Shelfwear, who posted it on boardgamegeek.com\n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/image/1580300/shelfwear [http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1580300/shelfwear]\n\n \n\n \n\nIt's a painting by Allen Douglas:\n\n \n\ntumblr_lsqqekjifc1r15y4io1_1280.jpg [http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsqqekjifc1r15y4io1_1280.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93153-a-small-request-preferably-for-the-cotr-guys/?do=findComment&comment=912954","commentId":912954,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1384954809,"content":"Thank you so much!
