I hope Star Wars ends up being coop.\n\nI am strongly in the camp of wanting this to be a LoTR clone… as in co-op / solo play and a encounter deck.. this was what was originally announced and I see no \"evidence\" either way.. but we will find out soon enough. Still Netrunner is a card game with a scifi theme that is known to be pvp.. so I think it woudl make sense for them to make this co-op.\n\ngvaughn1 said:\n\nI'll have to check out the LOTR game. Is that one suitable for solo (if one player acts as two players)?\n\nlike all co-op games yes it can be played solo.. but this one isn't as good at solo as you would think. It also has a lot of really cool expansions that improve the game a ton.. though one of them introduces a Dungeon Master (as someone can play Sauron vs the players). I just do not think this really a game that is fun solo. The game itself is very good though in co-op… it is also great for kids as it isn't very complex.\n\nThe FFG version is identical to the original apart from typical FFG style improvments to the componants and the art on the main board, this is debatabel as an improvmet.. but there are no changes to the rules. ."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66101-coop-games/?do=findComment&comment=645925","commentId":645925,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1340012626,"content":"booored said:\n\nAngus Lee said:\n\nn addition, Gears of War, a fully-cooperative game for 1 to 4 players.\n\n \n\nOur game group has been meaning to get this for a while..
