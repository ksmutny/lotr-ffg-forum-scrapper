I often skimmed over the poems when reading Lord of the Rings, but Sam's (short) song in the tower of Cirith Ungol is a key moment where the situation seems hopeless but Sam doesn't give into despair. It's my favourite song from LOTR, and I'm glad that they've made it into a decent card that can work well with Sam. You can listen to Bill Nighy's interpretation of the song in the BBC's excellent radio dramatization of LOTR over here:\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nÉometh (the last remaining Middle Earth Quest hero, after we got Argalad this cycle) is definitely a possibility for the hero, but there are many named Rohan characters in Tolkien, many of whom are at least somewhat significant (perhaps more significant characters than any other faction). Other possibilities include Grimbold, Gamling, Gléowine, or even Spirit Éomer.\n\n \n\nI'd love to get a Grimbold hero for a two handed playthrough of Helm's Deep in my thematic campaign. One deck would be the defenders (Fellowship Aragorn, Théoden, and two out of Éomer, Gimli, and Legolas, with the remaining one, Háma, and Gamling as allies) and the other deck would be the reinforcements (Gandalf, Erkenbrand, and Grimbold). Elfhelm wouldn't be as thematic as Grimbold, since he went to defend Edoras rather than participating in Helm's Deep. If we get a Gamling hero instead, the decks would have their heroes be Fellowship Aragorn, Gimli, Spirit Legolas (since Tactics Legolas's ability is a disadvantage), Théoden, Éomer, Háma, and Gamling. This option is perhaps more thematic, but it has the disadvantage of excluding the excellent Háma and Gamling allies, as well as my Beyond-All-Hope'd Gandalf. Éometh could serve as a placeholder for either Grimbold or Gamling, but I'd prefer to not need FFG-created heroes in my thematic campaign.\n\nEdited October 28, 2016 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233543-the-black-serpent/?do=findComment&comment=2479629","commentId":2479629,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1477690247,"content":"Sopranos?
