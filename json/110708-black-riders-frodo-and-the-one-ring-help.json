Seems like if I can just reveal a card and treat it as blank (disregarding it entirely no matter if treachery, location, or enemy ) this is quite powerful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110708-black-riders-frodo-and-the-one-ring-help/?do=findComment&comment=1152790","commentId":1152790,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1405189738,"content":"C) cancel everything.

It also only shuffles the card rather than discarding it meaning if the encounter deck is low on cards it only provides a temporary respite."}]}
