In the list are recaps for Journey Along the Anduin (you can't talk about building a deck to kill the Hill Troll turn 1 and then not do it) and Into Ithilien, plus a short summary of a long series of failure against Shadow and Flame. Spoiler alert: the balrog is rough.\n\n \n\nComing up in the future (in no particular order unless I get requests) are a Faramir Outlands deck, a Dain-less dwarf swarm, and a deck focused on all of the location clearing attachments (like Ancient Mathom)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/207137-weekly-deck-tech-series/?do=findComment&comment=2152080","commentId":2152080,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1459882586,"content":"Looks fun.
