The players has discovered the specific treasure card he wishes to use through game text in a previous scenario using the same group of heroes he is currently playing with.\n\n2. The specific treasure card belongs to a treasure set that is listed in the setup instructions for the scenario currently being played. The treasure set icon appears in place of a sphere icon on the treasure cards, and can also be used to identify which scenario it can be discovered in.\n\nAny treasure card that meets the above conditions can be added to a player's deck during the setup of a scenario. No more than 1 copy of any treasure card, by title, can be added to a player's deck. Treasure cards added to the deck do not count towards that deck's 50 card minimum.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69132-new-rules-for-treasure-cards/?do=findComment&comment=673881","commentId":673881,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1344967711,"content":" Which means that none of the treasures in The Hobbit(s) can be used in any of the previous Quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69132-new-rules-for-treasure-cards/?do=findComment&comment=673898","commentId":673898,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1344969946,"content":"Bullroarer Took said:\n\n \n\n Which means that none of the treasures in The Hobbit(s) can be used in any of the previous Quests.\n\n \n\n \n\nright. they established that in in the first article that revealed this expansion, i think (either that, or the second one)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69132-new-rules-for-treasure-cards/?do=findComment&comment=673926","commentId":673926,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1344972602,"content":"Dain Ironfoot said:\n\nBullroarer Took said:\n\n Which means that none of the treasures in The Hobbit(s) can be used in any of the previous Quests. \n\nright. they established that in in the first article that revealed this expansion, i think (either that, or the second one).\n\n\n\nAnd as usual I stone cold missed it!  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69132-new-rules-for-treasure-cards/?do=findComment&comment=673928","commentId":673928,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1344972653,"content":"Bullroarer Took said:\n\nDain Ironfoot said:\n\n \n\nBullroarer Took said:\n\n Which means that none of the treasures in The Hobbit(s) can be used in any of the previous Quests. \n\nright. they established that in in the first article that revealed this expansion, i think (either that, or the second one).\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd as usual I stone cold missed it!  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]\n\n\n\nhaha. no worries! it happens! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nand it's both a blessing and a curse. blessing cuz it adds uniqueness to the saga expansion; a curse cuz i'll want those cards in every deck! haha."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69132-new-rules-for-treasure-cards/?do=findComment&comment=673945","commentId":673945,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1344974564,"content":" Was there anybody NOT thinking about Mithril coat on Bilbo?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69132-new-rules-for-treasure-cards/?do=findComment&comment=673948","commentId":673948,"userName":"Hastur360","timestamp":1344974746,"content":"There is still a chance for that Treasure card in the next Saga Expansion of the Hobbit.
