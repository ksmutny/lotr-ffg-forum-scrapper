So character get damage tokens for damage and venom tokens (top player deck card under this characters) facedown) as well. If charachters have a venom equal his vitality he is lose his mind and you discard all venom tokens( all players cards under him face down) and turn him 180 and he cannot quest, attack gather recources if he is hero and even cannot take undefended attack. So he is completely out until Bilbo wake him up."}]}
