The ones I have managed to find so far are The Treason of Saruman, The Lost Realm, Heirs of Numenor, the Sands of Harrad, and The Hobbit Overhill and Underhill. I have also found 2 of the Mirkwood Cycle packs - A Journey to Rhosgobel and Return to Mirkwood\n\nOut of these, which expansion is best for solo play to begin with?\n\nAny help greatly appreciated :)\n\nDean."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294648-new-to-the-game-what-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=3691737","commentId":3691737,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1556555511,"content":"It's a pity the expansions you mentioned are the bottom half in terms of quality. I guess there's a reason you couldn't find the other expansions.\n\nLost Realm and Heirs of Numenor are on the harder side, so I probably wouldn't start with those. Treason of Saruman + Ringmaker has quite a few great quests, but also some real stinkers, and is overall one of the most complex cycles rules-wise and in terms of board fiddlyness. The Hobbit is great for solo play, incredibly thematic and fun, but lacks replayability and strong quest design. Sands of Harad is probably your best bet. The quests aren't the hardest out there, but are still challenging, and the player cards open up a lot of possibilities for deck-building.\n\nIn short, I'd go with either The Hobbit or Sands of Harad. If you chose the Hobbit saga, I'd also recommend picking up Return to Mirkwood (Dain will improve the new Dwarf decks you can build.)\n\nHope that helps! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294648-new-to-the-game-what-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=3691815","commentId":3691815,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1556558667,"content":"> Quote\n> \n> Treason of Saruman + Ringmaker\n\nTo prevent confusion, Treason of Saruman is the third LotR saga box and does not go with the Ringmaker cycle. \n\nThis means it isn't a great pickup either, but not for the same reason stated.\n\nOtherwise I largely agree with the previous reply.

However, I've just seen that an online store is restocking The Road Darkens next week, so instead of buying Sands of Harrad (or the Hobbit), is it worth getting The Road Darkens instead?\n\nIt is true that getting The Road Darkens is not on the face of it better than getting Sands of Harad which has some decent quests in it and which are playable with a smaller card pool. Of the boxes you have seen Hobbit is probably an obvious place to start but i do find it a frustrating quest box to be honest and prefer the 2nd Hobbit box, so i would choose Harad in preference.\n\nHowever i have been waiting to get a copy of Road Darkens in the UK for well over a year, it has been one of the hardest to get for me and i have enjoyed the saga boxes without playing campaign style. I now have the first 4 saga boxes (once my Road Darkens turns up) but it has taken 2 years to get them given the slow reprints.\n\nSome thoughts i put down on all expansion boxes and i only play solo > http://crusadersgames.co.uk/board-games/lord-of-the-rings-lcg-expansions/ [http://crusadersgames.co.uk/board-games/lord-of-the-rings-lcg-expansions/]\n\nWhilst what you have found are some of the harder expansions, you do have some of my favourite quests in there, Rhosgobel and Return to Mirkwood are my two favourite Mirkwood cycle ones, plus Treason of Saruman is a good box i am just about to finish playing through myself. Lost Realms is great and Sands of Harad a little more straightforward. \n\nPlayer card wise Hobbits boxes will build up a dwarven deck, Sands is quite focused on Haradrim so may depend on the theme you like.\n\nEdited May 1, 2019 by Crusaderlord"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294648-new-to-the-game-what-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=3693439","commentId":3693439,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1556715986,"content":"I'd pass on Road Darkens unless you can also find Black Riders.
