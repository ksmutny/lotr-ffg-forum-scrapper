This week’s tournament marks the grand finish in a series of solo player tournaments exploring the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular scenario with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].\n\nWill you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular scenario under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament, feel free to post them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104&efpag=0].\n\nAnd now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!\n\nSolo Player Tournament #8:\n\nQuest: Return to Mirkwood\nDeck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + All Shadows of Mirkwood Adventure Packs\nNumber of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck\n\nTop Ten:\n\n1. muemakan ~ 64 (Théodred, Éowyn, Beravor)\n2.

Fortunatly I had SoG plus 3 Gandalfs. One Gandalf killed the Hummerhorns which were dealt during the setup. Another Gandalf damaged the Hill Troll with 4 points. One Gandalf lowered my threat.\n\nThe game went smoothly, even the Marsh Adder didn't pose a real problem. Then I got the Hill Troll on turn 6, and I was already at 4B. Could have had a result below 90, ****. I had Gandalf in play that round and had 2 x Ever Vigilant so he could both defend and attack against the troll. Dain helped him so the troll had 3 damage when round 7 started. Of course I got \"Gollum's Bite\" which killed poor Glóin. Gandalf gave the troll another 4 damage, the Longbeard Orc Slayer was sacrificed and I had to raise my threat from 48 to 49. Then Gandalf and Dain delivered the final blow.\n\nMuch more to say, it was so epic. If they had only done something abut the threat - I hate to stop an adventure just when it starts to get interesting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59347-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-8-january-22-28-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=583228","commentId":583228,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1327251732,"content":"Forget the last result.

In round 3 I got SoG and could play Faramir and Westroad Traveller. No problem to finish 2B.  Everyone but Dain quested in round 4. Éowyn's ability gave me the extra WP point that I needed to make it through 3B in one round. (I guess it's allowed to discard a card in 3B?) I readied Faramir with Ever Vigilant and he took the bite of the adder. Dain defended against the Spider. In round 5 I could play a Song of Travel so I could play GG. Éowyn quested alone, the traveller got eaten by the adder and Gollum distracted the King Spider which was then slain by Glóin + Dunedain Mark. Dain then attacked the adder for one damage. In round 6 I played the Longbeard Orc Slayer. Éowyn quested, Faramir didn't survive his second battle with the adder, but the angry dwarves avanged him right afterwards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59347-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-8-january-22-28-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=583242","commentId":583242,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1327253309,"content":" Tried doing this with a Monosphere spirit deck, but couldn't win.  Changed out around a dozen card and put theodred in instead of Eleanor and got this result:\n\nHeros: eowyn, dunhere, theodred\n\nNo damage, no dead Heros, no victory points.\n\nThreat, 40.\n\nRounds 4 (40).\n\nScore: 80.\n\nBig key here was I got 2 celebrians stones on eowyn and an unexpected courage on dunhere.  Theodreds kick back helped to, along with elf helm (the one time I got to use him) kept off a point of threat.

Dry Watercourse (2B done)\n\n8. Spiders Ring (3B done)\n\n9. Gollum´s Anguish ( was cancelled and Stage 4B done)\n\nYeah you´r right. I guess no enemies was really lucky......as in my other games I played after that one. I had 2 Attercops in my first turn for instance. Or 2 Trolls in the course of the game. I had another 80 result which had enemies in it. I think as long as the first 2 rounds don´t have a monster enemy, I am quite ok.\n\nDon´t forget I had Gollum´s Anguish in round 2. That´s an additional 40 threat. That makes 7 Gandalfs and one GG.
