So cool listening to Caleb explain the design process and the logic that goes into making each card what it is.\n\nAlso since he explained the reasoning of not putting Aragorn in this box, I'm going to have to retract my whole hero prediction for the next box as I vehemently argued that we would receive new versions of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. After hearing Caleb it sounds as tho he is trying to avoid remakes of heroes from the core for the saga expansions; which I understand...just would be cool to get an update on some of these iconic characters"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=855542","commentId":855542,"userName":"scott80","timestamp":1378074760,"content":"Considering Caleb saying that he's a big fan on the lore and corrects people in the design team occasionally on it, I'm surprised he didn't do so, in that it wasn't Aragorn who gave the Westernesse blades to the hobbits :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited September 1, 2013 by scott80"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=855657","commentId":855657,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1378089005,"content":"It's really cool to see how passionate Caleb is about this game.  Watch how he smiles when the Team Covenant guys are excited about a new card.\n\n \n\nThe edit at the end is hilarious!  Some guy in a blue shirt walks up and interrupts the interview.  The camera angle changes and he is gone."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=855668","commentId":855668,"userName":"kyrie","timestamp":1378090873,"content":"> Considering Caleb saying that he's a big fan on the lore and corrects people in the design team occasionally on it, I'm surprised he didn't do so, in that it wasn't Aragorn who gave the Westernesse blades to the hobbits :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI was thinking the same thing.

I think that's why he's bringing up his affinity for Westernesse blades because it references the actual passage from the books.

Maintaining sphere identity is obviously an important point in design but seems somewhat secondary on the surface anyway"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=856167","commentId":856167,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1378149824,"content":"The stupid question of the day .... when is the release date ? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=856285","commentId":856285,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1378161830,"content":"> The stupid question of the day .... when is the release date ?\n\n4-6 weeks was said at gencon which was like 2 weeks ago"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=856582","commentId":856582,"userName":"Morithain","timestamp":1378212965,"content":"Argh!  I'm tired of waiting for this!  Shut up and take my money already :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=856796","commentId":856796,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1378229839,"content":"I picked up the Core Set on a whim last summer at GenCon 2012 and its become my go-to table-top game since then.  I find the game immensely enjoyable.\n\n \n\nSadly, I couldn't attend GenCon this year but I was able to persuade a friend to pick up the Black Riders for me (should have had her snag BoG for me as well, but didn't know about it being on sale there until it was too late).  I've had a chance to play the first scenario about a half dozen times times.  Very happy with it so far.  As you all likely already know, the player cards are almost entirely for hobbit decks.  Those of us who follow the game closely have been waiting for hobbit support for some time, so I don't think this will be an issue for most of the community.  As usual, the artwork on the cards is just outstanding. \n\n \n\nIn my opinion most LoTR players will greatly enjoy BR.\n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about BR, please feel free to PM me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=859587","commentId":859587,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1378494161,"content":"Bill the Pony just made Radagast a little more playable again!
