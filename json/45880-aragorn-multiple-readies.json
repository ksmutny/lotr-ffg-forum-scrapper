It is a Response so it can only be trigger at the moment the conditions apply which in this case is committing Aragorn to a quest. Since you can not trigger his ability after defending, because it is not questing, you can not spend a resource to ready him."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45880-aragorn-multiple-readies/?do=findComment&comment=459965","commentId":459965,"userName":"daveman006","timestamp":1303914176,"content":"Okay thank you I was playing it that way anyway just wondering about the situation because my friend asked me about that when playing."}]}
