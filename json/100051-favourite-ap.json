I am not talking about quest but about player cards.\n\nSo which AP's cards do you use the most?\n\nAnother question is, which pack do you like more: The Long Dark or Shadow and Flame?

Shadow and Flame contains Elrond and Vilya, so that's definitely a plus. The Long Dark contains the Warden of Healing, which has great synergy with Elrond. I like Foundations of Stone, both for quest and player cards (Glorfindel and Light of Valinor). And Watcher in the Water is fun as well, and has Lore Aragorn and Arwen (superb ally).\n\nYeah... Dwarrowdelf all the way for me. Looking forward to Ringmaker as well.\n\nEdit: Mostly solo or 2-player. Sometimes 3.

You get Elrond Vilya Combo for a whole new deck type. Hands Upon the Bow, Master of the Forge for attachment heavy deck, and a few other really good cards.\n\nThe only card that stands out in long dark is Warden of Healing. Hama is good hero, but i don't use him much, since i don't like the deck strategy he uses.\n\nFoundation of Stone and Watcher n the Water are probably two the the best AP,along with Shadow in Flame they have some of the best player cards in the game, you could probably build some good decks with those 3 AP and just a core set."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100051-favourite-ap/?do=findComment&comment=995770","commentId":995770,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1393354015,"content":"IMO, the best bang for your buck player card wise, are offered in FoS & stewards fear.\n\nFoS is the Glorfindel power pack, and you simply can't go wrong there. (Great quest multi player)\n\nStewards fear is basically a deck in a pack. Outlands, ready to play. (Good quest single player)\n\nAs for long dark vs shadow flame? I'd pick S&F. Great cards overall.\n\nLong dark got the warden of healing though, which is also good."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100051-favourite-ap/?do=findComment&comment=995840","commentId":995840,"userName":"Scroll Lock","timestamp":1393357062,"content":"My shop hasn't FoS so...\n\nI am not that interested in outlands...
