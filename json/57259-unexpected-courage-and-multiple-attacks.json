Am I correct?\n\n \n\n \n\nOnce per round, yes. From p. 20 of the rules:\n\n\"Each player can declare an attack (with any number of eligible attackers he controls) against each enemy with which he is engaged once each round\" [emphasis mine].\n\nThe OP's play is perfectly legal. However, after Legolas attacks an enemy, neither Legolas nor any other characters controlled by the same player will be able to initiate a second attack against that same enemy until the next game round."}]}
