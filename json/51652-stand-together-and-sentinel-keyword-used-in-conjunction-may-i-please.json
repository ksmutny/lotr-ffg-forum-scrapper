Now, I was thinking as Sentinel goes, a Sentinel keyword character can defend any attack that is declared as undefended. Therefore only Sentinel keyworded characters may defend previously declared undefended attacks, but what if at this same time, during this same attack more than one Sentinel keyworded character is available to defend against said attack. If I was to have a Stand Together card in hand at that very moment, could I group together a bunch of Sentinel keywords as defenders?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51652-stand-together-and-sentinel-keyword-used-in-conjunction-may-i-please/?do=findComment&comment=515233","commentId":515233,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1313487061,"content":"Well, I cannot help you since I do not even understand one thing.
