This means you can actually put it on any hero and any ally as well.\n\nDunedain Mark reads \"attach to a hero\", this means it can be attached to any hero but not allies.\nRohan Warhorse however reads \"attach to a tactics or rohan hero\", this means it can only be attached to heros that are of the tactics sphere or have Rohan as one of their traits."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111649-using-cards-for-different-spheres-of-influence/?do=findComment&comment=1169118","commentId":1169118,"userName":"jimjim19681968","timestamp":1406256929,"content":"Many, many thanks.
