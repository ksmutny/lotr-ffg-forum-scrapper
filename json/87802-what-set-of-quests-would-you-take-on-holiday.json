Don't know how you organize your cards, but I always keep all the cards from the expansions and their respective encounter sets together.

My friends had played the game some (core set mostly) and we all had a blast. That scenario in particular is a good mix of challenging and fun, and it scales well based on the number of players - assuming that you use well-built decks."}]}
