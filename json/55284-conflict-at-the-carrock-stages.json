What caught my attention is that the second (and last) part of the adventure doesn't have any line stating how to win as all the previous ones had...\n\nSo I'm wondering if it should have 3 stages and I got a misspack, in wich case I need to know how to claim for the one I'm missing.\n\nIs there any place to see full lists of all cards of each expansion?\n\nThanks,\n\nJavier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55284-conflict-at-the-carrock-stages/?do=findComment&comment=547064","commentId":547064,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1319539285,"content":"Once you complete the second cards conditions you win.
