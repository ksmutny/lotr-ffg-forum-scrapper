This quest actually is quite easy for solo but going to be really hard with 3 otr 4 players. If you play solo dont move to the next quest stage every turn until you ready for that. Otherwise in can be really risky."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77577-about-flight-from-moria-quest-which-way-do-you-choose/?do=findComment&comment=748824","commentId":748824,"userName":"Pickles","timestamp":1358391959,"content":"Cutievalkyrie said:\n\n1.
