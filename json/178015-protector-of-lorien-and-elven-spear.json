A particular scenario just occurred to me:\n\n \n\nI run Erestor and have 10 cards in the planning phase of round 1. Two of these are Protector of Lorien. The card is not unique and has no \"1-per-character\" restriction. All it has is a \"Limit 3 times\" for the discard. So nothing stops me from attaching both copies to e.g. Erestor, discard 6 cards and quest with him for 8 Willpower?\n\n \n\nThe same could be asked about Elven Spear, as you can have 2 restricted attachments. Discard 6 cards, give e.g. Elladan 9 Attack?\n\n \n\nThe \"Limit 3 times per phase\" seems to refer to the attachment in question and not to raising the hero's stats overall. Am I wrong?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178015-protector-of-lorien-and-elven-spear/?do=findComment&comment=1635373","commentId":1635373,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1432580733,"content":"I agree with your assessment that \"per phase\" limits are per card/attachment, and do not pertain to raising hero stats overall.

However, if a card has a limit of\n“once per game,” that limitation is specific to the player\nwho triggered it.\n \nSo yes......I believe if you want to protect Lorien really really well you can add up to 6 defense with two of those cards. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178015-protector-of-lorien-and-elven-spear/?do=findComment&comment=1635830","commentId":1635830,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1432631698,"content":"The problem is that it's only good for the first turn.

After that, not so much.\n\nThat's correct. After the first round erestor only draws you 3 new cards each round, unless you build more card draw into the deck.. Assuming you'll still want to play some cards in the early rounds to get the deck up and running, cards like PoL and the spear attached will add little strength to a stat with only 1-3 cards to discard, that's really not much to get the most out of each of these discard attachments each round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178015-protector-of-lorien-and-elven-spear/?do=findComment&comment=1636455","commentId":1636455,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1432660475,"content":"Yes, it's pretty much a one-shot opportunity with the cards we know of so far - I just wondered if power-questing like that on the first round would be legal in theory.
