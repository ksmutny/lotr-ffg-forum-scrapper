I look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI like it. I use the same strategy, both card drawing and resource management in a Beravor Theodred Eowyn deck.\n\nJust a minor point to your strategy. I know you want get Gloin damaged but as for a sturdy defender, Bilbo seems a much more obvious choice. He starts with 2 instead of 1 point of defense, he is Lore character so he can get A Burning Brand right away. I think this is better against the biggies and you can still let the smaller ones slip to make you rich.\n\nThe Map-maker is awesome. It was the first thought I had, to combine him with Gloin. Really good. I just seem to be unable to make a strong deck around Gloin, even with Frodo and Denethor that make him super awesome - with Frodo taking the undefended damage that would have accidently killed Gloin."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51495-the-hobbit-a-thematic-deck-list/?do=findComment&comment=514204","commentId":514204,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1313271417,"content":" Needs more Thorin Oakenshield in my opinion\n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/image/986610/rightrhombus [http://boardgamegeek.com/image/986610/rightrhombus]\n\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=362110 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=362110]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51495-the-hobbit-a-thematic-deck-list/?do=findComment&comment=514224","commentId":514224,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1313279301,"content":"Yeah too bad.

I find it a pity that the restrain of years will disallow some of the shiny characters like Thorin.\n\nAnd Gloin did most likely replace Thorin here but the ability is not the same. Thorin's was far more powerful even - allowing the player to spend his damage tokens as resource tokens. You would not need to combine it with healing then. Probably too strong it would have been, even though it was Thorin Oakenshield himself."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51495-the-hobbit-a-thematic-deck-list/?do=findComment&comment=514335","commentId":514335,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1313315977,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\n \n\nTactics - 19\nLongbeard Orc-Slayer x3\nSneak Attack x3\nDunedain Warning x3\nSon of Arnor x2\nFor Gondor x2\nSteward of Gondor x2\nGrim Resolve x1\nCampfire Tales x3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like this idea, and the deck looks like it will play well.  You may want to change the word Tactics to Leadership though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51495-the-hobbit-a-thematic-deck-list/?do=findComment&comment=514343","commentId":514343,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1313316815,"content":"Kiwina said:\n\n \n\nYou may want to change the word Tactics to Leadership though.\n\n\n\nThat's what they call a \"feint\" :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
