I'd like to take a closer look at some favorite scenarios by briefly highlighting the story, geography, artwork, lore, especially nasty encounter cards, and any memorable playthroughs. I am open to feedback and ideas from readers who enjoy these types of articles. As always, no promises on how regularly I will be able to write, but as more profiles are published, I'll work to keep a running log in this post. Thanks for being such a great cooperative gaming community.
