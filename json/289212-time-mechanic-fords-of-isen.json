For example, I passed stage 1 but couldn't advance until I took control of Grima. Can't take control of Grima until I have no enemies engaged. So during combat I defeated the last enemy, took control of Grima and immediately then advance to stage 2. Stage 2 has a \"time\" mechanic and the time counter goes down at the end of the refresh phase....and refresh is my next step. This happens again between stage 2 and 3.  Since you cannot advance to the next stage until at least completing the quest phase, you will reduce the time counter by 1 on the new stage before you ever get a chance to quest on the new stage. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289212-time-mechanic-fords-of-isen/?do=findComment&comment=3591847","commentId":3591847,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1547526995,"content":"The fastest you can do it is: round 1, quest. Then travel to The Islet (which has Grima attached).  Round 2, quest and clear The Islet. You will then have control of Grima and advance to the next stage if you have enough quest points on the stage (you don't need to clear all enemies before controlling Grima. Did you read that somewhere?).  Then, yes, the time counter on stage 2 will be reduced by 1 at the end of the round, and you will not have had any chance to quest on this stage before that happens.  You can most likely expect these Time effects to trigger one or more times during a game!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289212-time-mechanic-fords-of-isen/?do=findComment&comment=3591873","commentId":3591873,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1547529266,"content":"Hm...technically, if you do it following @GrandSpleen [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/177891-grandspleen/]'s description, wouldn't you control Grima (and thus advance the quest) before you place progress on stage 2?
