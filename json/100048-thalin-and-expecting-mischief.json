Since these share a trigger the first player could arguably designate Thalin´s effect to trigger; the enemy thus removed, expecting mischief has no legal target to damage. However if another enemy is revealed during staging, expecting mischief is not eligible to trigger because that enemy is not \"the first enemy revealed\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100048-thalin-and-expecting-mischief/?do=findComment&comment=1004327","commentId":1004327,"userName":"-nebur-","timestamp":1394086400,"content":"This is clear...but what is with the Traps + Thalin/Mischief ?\n\n \n\n\"If unattached, attach Poisoned Stakes to the next eligible enemy that enters the staging area.\"\n\n \n\nThey include the phrase \"next eligible enemy\" and if we kill some with Thalin/Mischief, they are not eligible anymore...\n\nWithout any doubt, isn't it?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100048-thalin-and-expecting-mischief/?do=findComment&comment=1004357","commentId":1004357,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1394089418,"content":"> This is clear...but what is with the Traps + Thalin/Mischief ?\n> \n>  \n> \n> \"If unattached, attach Poisoned Stakes to the next eligible enemy that enters the staging area.\"\n> \n>  \n> \n> They include the phrase \"next eligible enemy\" and if we kill some with Thalin/Mischief, they are not eligible anymore...\n> \n> Without any doubt, isn't it?\n\nHmm good question. There is a recent ruling, I believe, that says a card has entered play as soon as it is revealed (in regards to immune to player card effects) but I don´t think that means they have necessarily entered the staging area yet. Arguably Thalin´s ability would trigger before the trap as he triggers \"as it is revealed\" whereas the trap awaits the enemy to \"enter the staging area\".\n\nThis approach sounds logical to me but if anyone has some insights I´d be happy to hear about it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100048-thalin-and-expecting-mischief/?do=findComment&comment=1004416","commentId":1004416,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1394097517,"content":"Yeah, there is more than one official answer where it is said that cards while being revealed are in play but not yet in the staging area so that the enemy could die before reaching staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100048-thalin-and-expecting-mischief/?do=findComment&comment=1004436","commentId":1004436,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1394099813,"content":"Why is expecting Mischief an action?\n\nI have ran into some weird timing issues with EM and Thalin. Lets say a 3 hp enemy with a when revealed and Surge enters the staging area. Thailin immediately deals one damage. When revealed should trigger before an action can be triggered and so should surge before the enemy is destroyed the enemy is destroyed. Now if EM were a response then it would destroy the enemy before When Revealed but Surge would still go off. If it were a passive effect like Thailin then it would destroy the enemy before when revealed and surge.\n\nThis has been confusing to me, can someone who knows how this is played number the correct steps to play this correctly, since I have been leaning towards the more difficult in interpretation, which means that if a an attachment like Ranger spikes was in the staging area it would attach, and then the enemy is destroyed, and surge will still trigger.\n\nThanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100048-thalin-and-expecting-mischief/?do=findComment&comment=1004460","commentId":1004460,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1394103573,"content":"Expecting Mischief is an action only insofar that it must be played from your hand before the staging step. Once it has been played, it´s ability becomes a passive ability (very much similar to Thalin´s).\n\nIf EM was a reaction ability then the card would have to specify which effect triggers that reaction. In this case it would probably be \"after an enemy is revealed...\" which would place it after Thalin´s ability (and any surge effects), not before. That wording should still trigger before it is added to the staging area (and any traps waiting there) though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100048-thalin-and-expecting-mischief/?do=findComment&comment=1004474","commentId":1004474,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1394105387,"content":"Okay, i see how it works.
