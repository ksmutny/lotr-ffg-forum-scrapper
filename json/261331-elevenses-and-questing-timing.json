I was thinking that since the rulebook has a green box at the very end of the Quest Phase that that would be a valid time to try this effect.\n\nThis is a fairly new card too so I think I would be surprised if this interaction was not considered."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/261331-elevenses-and-questing-timing/?do=findComment&comment=3037768","commentId":3037768,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1508581908,"content":"I already ask this to Caleb and the answer was:\n\n\n\n> In order to play Elevenses, you must play it immediately after the staging step resolves.
