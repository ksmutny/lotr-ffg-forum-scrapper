I also play chronologically by order of release. The nightmare quests are an exception to this, since I've skipped playing them until now.\n\nThe reason for this is that while I do enjoy a challenge, I don't enjoy losing over and over again (looking at you, Into Ithilien and Morgul Vale). Therefore I thought that by playing these quests later, once I've collected more cards from newer expansions, I'd be better able to handle the nightmare quests. The question then is: when do I start with them? I am currently in the Angmar Awakened cycle, so 2015 in year of release. Can I just play all the regular quests first, or will the oldest Nightmare quests then become too easy?\n\nI enjoy fine-tuning my deck, but don't like to build a complete new deck specifically tailored for a certain scenario.\n\nThanks for all the help."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291478-when-to-start-playing-nightmare-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3634304","commentId":3634304,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1551180027,"content":"I think you can choose when you start playing nightmare.  Remember that if ypu find them too easy with modern card pool you can always play them in progression order just using only the cards available when the nightmare decks were originally release. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291478-when-to-start-playing-nightmare-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3634441","commentId":3634441,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1551191818,"content":"Also, if you find something too easy with a powerful deck using the modern card pool, you have the option of building a less powerful deck.  My decks using the full card pool are frequently less powerful than a vintage progression-style Vilya deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291478-when-to-start-playing-nightmare-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3634481","commentId":3634481,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1551194584,"content":"I personally would just start picking up all the Nightmare decks once you've caught up with the full current card pool.
