BUT, \"Event cards are actions that are played directly from a player’s hand. \"  \n\n \n\nSo, by paying the cost of the card, you are choosing to activate the card's action.  For your idea to work, the play sequence would have to be: 1) pay cost to play the event (which itself does nothing), then 2) optionally trigger the action, 3) discard the event.  Instead, I think it is 1) pay cost to trigger the action (which is the same thing as 'play the event'), then 2) discard the event."}]}
