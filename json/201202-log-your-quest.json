If you want to log your quest, please use the next format:\n\n \n\nDeck: [Link to the deck used]\n\nQuest: [Name of the quest]\n\nMode: [Easy/Normal/Nightmare]\n\nPlayers: [N° of players]\n\nResult: [Fail/Success & Score]\n\n \n\nExample:\n\n \n\nDeck: goo.gl/1UYvnB [http://goo.gl/1UYvnB] [seastan's The Moneymaker]\n\nQuest: Into Ithilien\n\nMode: Normal\n\nPlayers: 1\n\nResult: Success!

If everyone logs only their successes it will be impossible to find out the hardest quests and the best decks, which is one of the main purposes of this thread. If you failed a quest 20 or more times without being able to finish it, don't be ashamed of it and just go ahead and report those results in here!\n * FOLLOW THE GAME RULES. This seems obvious, but if you realize you made a mistake during your gameplay, it's preferable you don't log that quest; let's try to keep this as \"clean\" as possible. Also, consider the erratas that have been made (Check here the Official FAQ [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/64/ee/64ee44ca-825d-4c14-b77b-b0ad7581ee31/lotr_faq_18.pdf] with all the Erratas, version 1.8)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201202-log-your-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2028768","commentId":2028768,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1454446085,"content":"huntforgollum-quest-image.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/huntforgollum-quest-image.jpg]\n\n \nDeck: goo.gl/TB8l8x [http://goo.gl/TB8l8x] [Elrond & Outlands]\nQuest: The Hunt for Gollum\nMode: Normal\nPlayers: 1\nResult: Success!

I'm usually putting into play 2, 3 and sometimes even up to 4 allies per round, all of them with the benefit of not needing to exhaust to commit to the quest the round they enter\n\n \n\nI had a previous version of this deck without outlands and with Theodred instead of Hirluin. Outlands perform better, and they're cheap so once you get that Steward of Gondor out you're pretty much set for the rest of the game in terms of resources. In the previous version of this deck I usually had over 8 cards in hand all the time, so I didn't need the harp that much; now with cheaper cards I'm usually being able to put into play much more allies, which in exchange means less cards in hand, so I'll consider the harp to combine with the mirror.\n\n \n\nFinally, I'm considering taking out the Defender of Rammas and Legolas. I'm thinking of replacing the Defender of Rammas for something that comes down faster, so I'm between Snowbourn Scout, Minas Tirith Lampwright or Vassal of the Windlord. Legolas is either too expensive if he appears soon, or appears too late when I'm already fully set up, and card-draw is not an issue for this deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201202-log-your-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2030804","commentId":2030804,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1454520744,"content":"orc-horse-thieves.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/orc-horse-thieves.jpg]\n\n \nDeck: http://goo.gl/CvqNBf [http://goo.gl/CvqNBf] [Elrond & Outlands version 1.1]\nQuest: The Hills of Emyn Muil\nMode: Normal\nPlayers: 1\nResult: Success! [112]\n \nDeck: http://goo.gl/CvqNBf [http://goo.gl/CvqNBf] [Elrond & Outlands version 1.1]\nQuest: The Hills of Emyn Muil\nMode: Normal\nPlayers: 1\nResult: Fail\n \nWas fully setup just waiting to get the last 4 VPs, with 20 characters on play.
