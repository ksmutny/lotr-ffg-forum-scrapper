You resolve it´s shadow card that does nothing, so in that case Frodo would be dead, but you decide to use Frodo´s ability to raise your threat by 2 to cancel that 2 damage that would been dealt to Frodo. \n\n \n\nI hope that this helped ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122541-frodo-damage/?do=findComment&comment=1271181","commentId":1271181,"userName":"jjenks476","timestamp":1411246338,"content":"Alright thanks a bundle"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122541-frodo-damage/?do=findComment&comment=1512719","commentId":1512719,"userName":"Mazarbul","timestamp":1427637985,"content":"Hi,\n\nMaybe I'm a bit daft but I still don't see an actual answer to the question. Frodo has 2 hit points and 2 defence. If the enemy attacking Frodo has a total of 6 attack, 2 of those are absorbed by Frodo's defence, so 4 points of damage remain.\n\nAs Frodo only has 2 hit points, would I gain 2 threat, or all 4 if I use his ability?\n\nEdited March 29, 2015 by Mazarbul"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122541-frodo-damage/?do=findComment&comment=1512747","commentId":1512747,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1427639006,"content":"I'm a little confused by what Dwarf King was trying to say, but the answer is that you would raise your threat by 4.  His available hit points do not limit the amount of damage he would take.  That would be pretty broken and there would be little reason to actually block with him instead of taking it undefended."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122541-frodo-damage/?do=findComment&comment=1512766","commentId":1512766,"userName":"Mazarbul","timestamp":1427640160,"content":"Thank you for your answer!"}]}
