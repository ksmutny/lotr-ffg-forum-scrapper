If there were locations with that trait, you could choose them to satisfy the \"when revealed\" effect. But there aren't, so you will have to select enemies like Forest Spider, King Spider, or Ungoliant's Spawn.\n\nAs Cotillion noted, it is usually best to make Ungoliant's Spawn one of the selections unless you are absolutely unable to deal with it. Otherwise, the game will drag on and on until you reveal the Spawn during a quest phase."}]}
