OKay, I guess the 3rd quest (hardship level 7) is there for people to play, not playing people. So, how the hell can we complete this quest?\n\nI'm kind of so pissed off tonight because we played so hard and we carefully built our deck and we carefully use every card and character ability. Still, we couldn't even get through State 1B! What the HELL? Is it really so so so hard?\n\nCan anyone give some advice regarding how we should build our deck to beat this not-for-human quest?\n\nThank you kind people..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53180-help-the-3rd-quest-hardest-one-in-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=528466","commentId":528466,"userName":"reno1051","timestamp":1316085725,"content":"ktei2008 said:\n\nI guess the 3rd quest (hardship level 7) is there for people to play, not playing people.\n\n \n\ncan you clarify what you mean here?  its a difficulty of 7, which should translate to the same difficulty no matter the number of players.  Of course, we know that this is not always the case."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53180-help-the-3rd-quest-hardest-one-in-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=528525","commentId":528525,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1316092196,"content":"Dol Guldur is definitely a terrible beast.\n\nSome things to consider while building your decks and planning a strategy:\n\nKeep in mind:\n\n * One of the heroes in play will be a prisoner until you get through that first stage.\n * You can only play one ally total each round.\n * The first stage requires 9 progress to get through it.\n\nSo you need to be able to successfully quest with enough willpower to get through that first quest stage even while being down one hero:\n\n * Use heroes with no less than 2 Willpower?\n * Use low cost allies with Willpower?\n\nPotential Heroes:\n\n * Aragorn\n * Gloin\n * Gimli\n * Eowyn\n * Glorfindel\n * Beravor\n * Frodo (adv. pack)\n * Prince Imrahil (adv. pack)\n\nMaybe try to consistently get through that first quest stage and determine what condition you want to be in heading into the 2nd stage.\n\nIs low starting threat as big a factor in Dol Guldur as it was for Anduin (Hill Troll)?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53180-help-the-3rd-quest-hardest-one-in-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=528564","commentId":528564,"userName":"peterstepon","timestamp":1316097111,"content":"Just an open question\n\nWould playing 4 mono decks and going all out make this scenario easier?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53180-help-the-3rd-quest-hardest-one-in-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=528576","commentId":528576,"userName":"Vyron2","timestamp":1316098008,"content":" I don't know what you mean with going all out - but YES, I have almost never lost the 3rd scenario with four players! the \"threat\" of one prisoner just isn't relevant, when you have 11 other heroes... the scaling is thus not optimal - the emprisonment has its greatest effect in solo mode, as 33% of your capacity is down... as opposed to 8,3% with four players...\n\n \n\nheck, I even introduced the game to a group of four people - who beat all 3 scenarios with 4 mono decks... ok, they WERE a bit lucky... but, you get me"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53180-help-the-3rd-quest-hardest-one-in-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=528886","commentId":528886,"userName":"ktei2008","timestamp":1316155486,"content":"Sorry guys, maybe I didn't describe my scenario clearly. Here's the thing: there are 3 quests in core set. The first quest has difficulty level 1 and the second one has difficulty level 4 and the last one, which I'm talking about has difficulty level 7.\n\nThere are only 2 players, which are me and my wife. We both built 2 decks which contain 50 cards for each (because the rule book says the minimum deck cards number is 50). We didn't have enough cards to build a mono deck of 50 cards, so each of us built a mixed deck (for example, I built a deck of 2 tactic hero + 1 leadership hero).\n\nThen we played like this but we couldn't even finish stage 1... So I'm here to ask you guys: how did you deal with this quest under the condition that you have 2 players and you have to build decks of 50 cards?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53180-help-the-3rd-quest-hardest-one-in-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=528887","commentId":528887,"userName":"ktei2008","timestamp":1316155590,"content":"Marlow said:\n\nDol Guldur is definitely a terrible beast.\n\nSome things to consider while building your decks and planning a strategy:\n\nKeep in mind:\n\n * One of the heroes in play will be a prisoner until you get through that first stage.\n * You can only play one ally total each round.\n * The first stage requires 9 progress to get through it.\n\nSo you need to be able to successfully quest with enough willpower to get through that first quest stage even while being down one hero:\n\n * Use heroes with no less than 2 Willpower?\n * Use low cost allies with Willpower?\n\nPotential Heroes:\n\n * Aragorn\n * Gloin\n * Gimli\n * Eowyn\n * Glorfindel\n * Beravor\n * Frodo (adv. pack)\n * Prince Imrahil (adv. pack)\n\nMaybe try to consistently get through that first quest stage and determine what condition you want to be in heading into the 2nd stage.\n\nIs low starting threat as big a factor in Dol Guldur as it was for Anduin (Hill Troll)?\n\n\n\nThank you for your advice.
