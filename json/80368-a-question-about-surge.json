Resolve the surge keyword immediately after resolving any when revealed effects on the card.\"\n\nSo I wonder if we need to add the card been revealed by the surge keyword into the staging area? or just trigger its keyword and \"when revealed\" effect and put it back to the encounter deck? because it doesn't say \"reveal and add into the staging area\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80368-a-question-about-surge/?do=findComment&comment=771033","commentId":771033,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1362632192,"content":"It´s added to the staging area"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80368-a-question-about-surge/?do=findComment&comment=771667","commentId":771667,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1362777570,"content":"If a treachery card has surge and the when revealed is canceled by test of will, does surge still trigger?
