FFG rates it at a 4 (so roughly parallel to The Hunt for Gollum, The Hills of Emyn Muil, etc.). I'd say it's probably a bit more challenging than other, similarly-rated quests. Ambush turns out to be a pretty fun mechanic, especially in conjunction with one particular location. Plus, most of the enemies have nasty effects that trigger whenever they engage a player. Since several shadow effects are of the \"return attacking enemy to the staging area\" variety, these engagement triggers can quickly become incredibly annoying. One word of advice: don't get too attached to your attachments (ha!). They probably won't be around for very long. \n\nAll in all, a nice addition to the collection. I'd rate it a notch below The Redhorn Gate, but above most of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. Overall, between a solid scenario and an excellent assortment of player cards, Road to Rivendell is one of the best APs released to date."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62107-road-to-rivendell-already-arrived/?do=findComment&comment=608783","commentId":608783,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1332385733,"content":"starhawk77 said:\n\nSince several shadow effects are of the \"return attacking enemy to the staging area\" variety, these engagement triggers can quickly become incredibly annoying.\n\nHmm, Dunhere going to shine like in Seventh Level?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62107-road-to-rivendell-already-arrived/?do=findComment&comment=608813","commentId":608813,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1332393587,"content":"Dam said:\n\nstarhawk77 said:\n\nSince several shadow effects are of the \"return attacking enemy to the staging area\" variety, these engagement triggers can quickly become incredibly annoying.\n\n \n\nHmm, Dunhere going to shine like in Seventh Level?\n\n\n\nYou mean Into the Pit? I wouldn't say Dunhere's quite as good on the Road to Rivendell, especially since most of the enemies have solid defense and a decent amount of hit points. Still, he can frequently pick off some of those bounced enemies before they discard more of your attachments or damage more of your characters.\n\nAlso, I really like the treacheries in this scenario. They can all be pretty nasty--Sleeping Sentry is one of the most backbreaking cards ever printed--but they are also inventive and flavorful.

Rhosgobel for instance, I think that was a neat idea to rescue an Eagle but I get bored by that quest easily because it is a quick run through, constantly hoping to draw a card or two, no fun. Actually the only two quests I replay from the cycle are Conflict at the Carrock and Return to Mirkwood.

I'll admit I've never used Dunhere in that particular scenario, but I see how he could definitely come in handy. Anyway, he's pretty good against the K-D goblins and their puny defense/health stats, since he can usually kill them in one or two shots. The RtR enemies are generally a bit more beefy, so Unseen Strike and Dunedain Mark will be necessary if you want Dunhere to be super helpful. Still, it might be worth it, since the forced effects I alluded to are pretty unpleasant.

I consider myself something of a vet at this game, but this one is BRUTAL! Anyone else having the same experience?\n\n \n\n \n\nI think the difficulty is highly contingent on whether or not a few key cards resolve. Sleeping Sentry is usually game over if you don't cancel it. Similarly, there are a few shadow effects that damage allies, so Arwen will die FAST unless you have some way to deal with shadow cards. Orc Ambush can also be really hard to deal with.\n\nOverall, I didn't find it particularly tough, but that was largely due to the fact that I run Eleanor. I didn't draw into A Test of Will, and she totally saved my bacon by canceling a Sleeping Sentry and an Orc Ambush. Any game-breaking treacheries are a lot less scary with her along for the ride.\n\nOn the other hand, my normally solid Dwarf deck has yet to defeat this scenario. I just can't seem to keep Arwen alive. So perhaps RtR is tougher than I initially thought."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62107-road-to-rivendell-already-arrived/?do=findComment&comment=609589","commentId":609589,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1332540492,"content":"muemakan said:\n\n I find the first stage to be brutal.
