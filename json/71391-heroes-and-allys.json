You can never play a unique card when there is already in play among you or he other players, but when you play a unique ally and there is a hero with the same name in play? Its not the same card but only the same name. So the question is: can i play a same named ally card when there is a hero with the same name in play?\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71391-heroes-and-allys/?do=findComment&comment=697192","commentId":697192,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1348125919,"content":" rulebook page 8:\n\n \n\n\n\nIf any player has a unique card in play, no player can play or put into play another card with the same title. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71391-heroes-and-allys/?do=findComment&comment=697203","commentId":697203,"userName":"Shiv@n","timestamp":1348127263,"content":"And it is also said in the rulebook from the hobbit (for Beorn for example)"}]}
