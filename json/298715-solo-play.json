The advantage of this is that the bookkeeping is easier, but you still get the benefits of two hands. I used this variant for about 2 years when I first got into the game. I copy my own variant on this system below:\n\nDRJ VARIANT - LORD OF THE RINGS – MODIFIED FELLOWSHIP RULES\n\n\n\nADAPTED FROM \"SIMBO SMITH\"\n\nThese rules are for solo players who want to play with 6 heroes all at once in one group, rather than split across two hands. How to play this variant and the rules changes are shown below:\n\nGAME SETUP\n\n\n\nHave one player deck of 50 cards as per normal. Draw 8 cards as your starting hand. You may mulligan. \n\nChoose more than 3 heroes (usually 6) and lay them side by side all in one hand.\n\nWhen calculating your threat, use 2 threat trackers. When you add up your heroes' starting threat you divide it in half and you put each half on one threat tracker. So if your starting threat is 60, you'd put 30 on each tracker. If it’s 61, you'd put 31 on one and 30 on the other.\n\nRESOURCE PHASE\n\n\n\nDraw 2 cards from your deck into your hand.\n\nEach hero gains one resource as per normal. \n\nPLANNING PHASE\n\n\n\nThere are no changes to this\n\nQUEST PHASE\n\n\n\nThis is exactly the same as per normal, but play two cards from the encounter deck into the staging area. \n\nTRAVEL PHASE\n\n\n\nThere are no changes to this\n\nENCOUNTER PHASE\n\n\n\nThere are no changes to this\n\nCOMBAT PHASE\n\n\n\nThere are no changes to this\n\nREFRESH PHASE\n\n\n\nYou add 1 threat to each threat tracker at the end of the round. \n\nCARD EFFECTS\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to any card effect that talks about the number of players, you always use 2 but you play the game as if you were 1 person. There is no 'first' player\n\nWhen you have to add threat to your tracker due to a card effect or failed quest resolution, you always add it to the lowest one (if they are both the same then obviously it doesn't matter which one you choose). You are not allowed to split the cost up and put half on each tracker - you always have to add the whole lot to the lowest one.\n\nWhen you have to work out what your threat is during the game, you always take the highest one. So if your threat trackers were showing 35 and 33, your threat is 35, enemies will engage the entire group at 35. \n\nAll the other rules stay the same.\n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298715-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=3763856","commentId":3763856,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1565847246,"content":"> 21 hours ago, GILLIES291 said:\n> \n> Chalk me up for solo one-handed only.

There are only 12 location cards with surge (not counting nightmare cards) in the whole game, so you are pretty reliably going to get max 1 location per turn. That means you can clear it each turn without any location control. The more hands you add, the more location control cards become essential. \n\nFor example, I have a Silvan deck which stomps in one handed, but because it has no location control cards it HAS to be paired with a deck that does in multiplayer or it gets stuck pretty consistently.\n\nSo there are other things besides sentinel and ranged which only really show their value in 2+ handed. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298715-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=3776362","commentId":3776362,"userName":"eliodoloro","timestamp":1567460222,"content":"> 15 hours ago, Schrodinger's Hat said:\n> \n> ...\n> \n> So there are other things besides sentinel and ranged which only really show their value in 2+ handed. \n\nThat's a really good point and a really good example.

There is something satisfying about taking a difficult quest and beating it solo. There's also something satisfying about making two decks intended to complement each other and then seeing them come together to beat the same difficult scenario.\n\nIn general I like to go for the impossible; I like to make decks that can hold their own solo but then contribute a definite strength when paired with another deck. For example I made an Elven deck designed to play solo (Elrond, Galadrial, sp-Glorfindel) and it does have a general specialty but I try to keep it ready for anything. When I took the deck to GenCon and played the \"competitive\" mode I paired with a guy who had built a pure combat deck. So I became the quest workhouse while he fought whatever he could and I helped out there only if needed.\n\nI will say that sometimes when I'm playing solo I just want a quick quest or a challenge I'm familiar with. Call me a simpleton (and I'll accept it) but sometimes I just like sitting back and taking a deck through Passage Through Mirkwood. I've played it dozens of times and I like how it can still surprise me if the cards draw right. If I'm in the mood to challenge a deck I'll take it through Journey Down the Anduin or Hunt for Gollum. However if I'm in the mood to progress or try new quests I will most likely do them two-handed solo or at that point not play solo and involve someone else.\n\nI think when it all comes down to it I love all the different ways that the game can be played.

Getting some synergy going between the two decks is brilliant.\n\nMy next move is into Over Hill and Under Hill, which is chronologically after the Dwarrowdelf Cycle.  I know nothing about the Saga Expansions really, but someone here said solo players get to use four heroes.  If that's true, that should supply the ability to use all four spheres and get more synergy into the game.  \n\nMy main concern with playing one handed is that I keep hearing how the scenarios just keep getting harder and harder as the game goes on, so missing one of the spheres may become too big of a liability at some point.  I've also considered trying to go all the way through one handed, and then going back and trying them all two handed, if I'm still alive by that point.\n\nI like playing one handed because it feels like I'm playing solitaire.  Playing two handed sounds too much like I'm pretending there's someone else there to play with.  That's a little unfair I'm sure, but that's the way it strikes me for now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298715-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=3797479","commentId":3797479,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1569993691,"content":"> 3 hours ago, Vince79 said:\n> \n> My next move is into Over Hill and Under Hill, which is chronologically after the Dwarrowdelf Cycle.  I know nothing about the Saga Expansions really, but someone here said solo players get to use four heroes.  If that's true, that should supply the ability to use all four spheres and get more synergy into the game.  \n> \n>  \n\nBilbo Baggins is his own \"Baggins\" sphere in the Hobbit saga (i.e., your other heroes will still represent at most three of the standard spheres if playing one-handed solo), and there are very few Baggins cards in the saga boxes.

I remember the effects at play in complicated board states better with other people at the table since things are being said out loud etc. and B. Because some quests are just so much cooler with multiple people and essentially lose what makes them unique when you play solo like the long dark and similar affairs. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298715-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=3817833","commentId":3817833,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1572397626,"content":"Starting with Khazad-Dum, I started playing using a three sphere deck (I play one handed solo), because of someone's suggestion here.  Also use songs to bring in the fourth sphere.  Before this, I considered this to be most likely completely impractical.  Now I look back at some of my two sphere decks and I wonder how I ever got by with them."}]}
