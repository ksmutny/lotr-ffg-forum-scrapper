If you fail the test you cannot put tokens on active location.So no tokens no progress. You just lost in this location and cannot find way out. Is pretty cool in my opinion.So tokens just burnout.\n\nPlease tell me is really difficult one??? I heard difficult level 7 so i love it but just need to know more about quest…… And what about encounter and quest cards?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64641-where-do-progress-tokens-go-if-i-cant-place-them-on-the-location-without-passing-a-location-test/?do=findComment&comment=631711","commentId":631711,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1337132015,"content":"I agree with Glaurung on this one.
