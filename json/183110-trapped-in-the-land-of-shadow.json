The new trap and event also encourage selective engagement of enemies so there's room for both. Maybe what we're looking at is more like the Hobbit strategy of keeping your threat low and selectively engaging enemies to get the most bonuses out of it. \nI do really prefer the non-engagement, damage in the staging area approach and always am looking for new cards to encourage that strategy. One thing I've learned is that it's hard to accomplish that purely in a solo game. I got very disappointed trying to do that with Lore Faramir back in the day. Having a pair of decks that compliment eachother in this regard are necessary. As the designers said, these rangers pair very well with Hobbits. So what I'm thinking about right now is some creative way to divide up the Hobbit and Ranger heroes to have one deck take the enemies (with Leadership Faramir) and the other benefit from non-engagement (ie with Haldir).\n\nMaybe there is a way to use both engagement and non-engagement decks in a mutually beneficial way.\n\n \n\n-Matthew Elias"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183110-trapped-in-the-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1702224","commentId":1702224,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1437693698,"content":"Ambush is an amazing card, like quick strike in lore.

Ambush works on enemies that engage you as well as ones which don't (and indeed allows you to gain benefits from engagement, with e.g. Faramir/Mablung/Pippin, which now I say would probably make for a pretty good deck, we can do the Faramir/Ent combo as well).

AMAZING art on all these cards and some REALLY solid new player cards.\n\nTrap decks far more viable now, new Fararmir hero is AWESOME and will be in lots of decks I think especially with so many great unique allies that have come out recently (Treebeard, Legolas, Gimi, Ingold and more) and the fact he works very well with Tactics Aragorn and Mablung. His ability is also very useful in quests that have enemies jumping out at you during different phases like staging. Ready one ally when a nasty foe engages you during the quest phase and then ready another during combat when further enemies engage you. With strong unique allies out getting to ready two of them is pretty powerful, with allies like Beorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir etc this is almost as good as readying two heroes!\n\nI REALLY love the concept behind the two ranger allies. Adding to an enemies engagement cost is a very cool ability and can buy you time against a nasty foe you are not ready to take on. Mablung ally can even return a nasty foe you are already engaged with back to staging and keep him there by raising its threat! This could be comboed with Dunhere or Haldir to kill foes in staging. Anborn is even better and can increase an enemies engagement cost every turn and also does 1 damage to them whilst doing so!! If you theoretically used this every turn it could really give a strong boost of power to a low threat, secrecy or staging area attack deck. It both weakens (direct damage) and keeps enemies unengaged every turn! If your threat gets too high or the ability stops being useful you instead have a 3 attack ally instead. \n\nThe event and attachment are both epic as well!!! The new trap is insanely cool! Quick Strike but you can attack with as many characters as you want!!! I think this may very well be going in my decks ASAP! \n\n \n\nalso we are getting spoiler articles so often! I love it!!!

Whether it is on an attachment or an event or something, I don't know but the effect would be something like this:\n\n \n\nResponse: After a trap card is attached to an enemy in the staging area, exhaust [attached hero OR a Ranger character OR any number of Ranger characters] to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against that enemy.\n\n \n\nIf I made it an event where only one character would attack, I think I'd just make the enemy have -2 def to help out. The only thing that sucks about this idea is that all of the traps are designed to do something counter-intuitive to what this card does, which means I'm pretty much \"wasting\" the trap just to be able to use this effect. If they made a new trap like \"Stuck In The Bog\" or something that represented holding an enemy still so they weren't able to defend themselves effectively, then make it just give an enemy -2 defense or something like that, it would probably be helpful for this effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183110-trapped-in-the-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1708107","commentId":1708107,"userName":"Djenni","timestamp":1438172337,"content":"Oh dear Eru this artwork is so good..\n\n \n\nthe-searching-eye.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/d3/6e/d36ef297-a7b7-4cad-91e9-c3b858d04c83/the-searching-eye.png]call-of-the-ring.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/82/ec/82ecc79a-71b2-44d2-87f2-7da979142d19/call-of-the-ring.png]\n\nEdited July 29, 2015 by Djenni"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183110-trapped-in-the-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1709214","commentId":1709214,"userName":"OlorinCZ","timestamp":1438237721,"content":"I really want to utilize the archery skills of Rangers and other direct damage cards.

I stayed with theme, as usual, but I did include Expecting Mischief (neutral theme I would say though it has Thorin art) which is great with Denethor. It is made to support my mono-Leadership Gondor deck of Boromir, Faramir, Imrahil. Of course, these will probably not be very useful against Uruk-hai but any quest with many lower hp enemies should be good. Many enemies in general, I am hoping, because the bigger ones can be slain in combat, the Leadership deck is very good at that. I love the idea of direct damage though, and I have been desperately trying to make the mechanics work. The new cards certainly give hope.\n\n \n\nI actually want to ask something. Can the Leadership Anborn kill an enemy when it is revealed, without resolving surge and/or \"when revealed\" effect, just at Thalin does? I am guessing not because the card says \"after\" but it would make the ability very useful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183110-trapped-in-the-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1709341","commentId":1709341,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1438254783,"content":"You can see that answer is \"no\" if you simply compare their card texts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183110-trapped-in-the-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1709370","commentId":1709370,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1438257576,"content":"Well, this is exactly how ruling in this game does NOT work.
