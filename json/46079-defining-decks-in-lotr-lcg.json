It seems to me that it would be handy to be specific about what type of deck we're talking about.\n\nStarter deck. One of the single sphere decks straight from a single core set. 30 cards, 1 Gandalf.\n\nLimited Tournament deck. A deck with 50 cards minumim and a maximum of 3 cards with the same name built from just a single core set.\n\nUnlimited Tournament deck. as limited but built from multiple card sets. \n\nCasual deck: deck built out of any number of core sets with no deck size minimum or maximum number of cards. For example I get the nagging feeling that some people might be taking a starter deck and simply adding a bunch of Gandalfs and so on. \n\nFrom my experience so far, I wouldn't mind betting that in many cases a starter deck is about as powerful as a limited tournament deck just due to the lower deck size and lack of resource mis-matches."}]}
