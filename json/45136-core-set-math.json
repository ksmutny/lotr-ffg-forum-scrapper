However, I don't like to play with fire, as he does. I like to play with MATH! So, if you'll allow me to vent...\n\nI'm always thinking about buying a second core set. I know I don't even have one core set yet, but I have to think about something until the game comes out. But I would like three of each Player Card, so I'll have a full card set to choose from whenever it is time to challenge the shadow. \n\nWe know three facts about player cards from the core rulebook: \n\n120 Player Cards (p3), 15 different cards per sphere (p10), 29 total cards per sphere (add Gandalf to get 30, p9 & 10) \n\nSo, in each core set, a given player card might appear 1, 2, o-r 3 times. But each sphere has to have 15 different cards total. Representing single copy, double copy, a-nd triple copy cards as a, b, c respectively, we see that a+b+c=15. \n\nMeanwhile, the core set contains a deck of 29 cards for each sphere. using the a, b, c for single, double, a-nd triple copies of cards, that means that a+2b+3c=29!\n\nTaking our two formulas, (a+b+c=15; a+2b+3c=29) I crunched the numbers through my brain and found eight possible card combinations for each sphere deck in the core set, which would satisfy both: 15 different cards per sphere; 29 total cards per sphere deck. And here they are:\n\n1 single copy card; 14 doubles; 0 triples.\n\n2 single copy cards; 12 doubles; 1 triple\n\n3 single copy cards; 10 doubles; 2 triples\n\n4 single copy cards; 8 doubles; 3 triples\n\n5 single copy cards; 6 doubles; 4 triples\n\n6 single copy cards; 4 doubles; 5 triples\n\n7 single copy cards; 2 doubles; 6 triples\n\n8 single copy cards; 0 doubles; 7 triples\n\nIt's possible that all the sphere decks will have the same number of single/double/triple cards in each. But maybe not. Regardless of which breakdown we end up with, we will be 64 cards short of a full play set (15 individual cards per sphere times three copies maximum: 15*3=45 needed, 29 per core set, 45-29=16, times four spheres, 16*4=64). \n\nHow many of those 64 cards will I be able to get, if I buy that second core set I have been pondering? It depends. \n\nFor each sphere that contains 1 single copy card, I can get 15 cards towards my complete play set from a second core set. \n\nFor each sphere with 2 single copy cards, I get 14\n\nEach Sphere with 3 single copy cards, 13\n\n4 single copy, 12\n\n5 single copy, 11\n\n6 single copies, 10\n\n7 single copies, 9\n\n8 single copies, 8\n\nSo I will get between 60-32 player cards towards a complete play set from a second core copy, seems like a good value. And that will leave me between 4-32 cards short. At that point, it might be time to hit up Ebay. \n\nWhat do you think? Are you going to try for a complete set of three of each player cards? Did I miss or misinterpret any facts or figures in my post? Should I go back to playing solo BSG o-r catching pokemon to pass the time for the next two weeks? Is there any more math I should be doing? Let me know!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45136-core-set-math/?do=findComment&comment=452493","commentId":452493,"userName":"MarioelKamui","timestamp":1302559366,"content":"well...nice maths...and like you im loosing my mind...waiting the preorder arrive...\n\nI have another option to know what exactly is in the box...in the video...part 1 it shows all of the cards...you can count them if you like"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45136-core-set-math/?do=findComment&comment=452506","commentId":452506,"userName":"mkultra","timestamp":1302564693,"content":"If you want to have a playset (3 of each card),  you need 3 core sets.

With the other LCG games though, are there so many \"extra\" cards that will end up as pointless waste of space if you buy multiple core sets? With LoTR, you have all the encounter and quest cards that will just end up spare if you buy multiple core sets.\n\nDo the other purchases of additional core copies with the other LCGs also end up with similar numbers of waste cards as LoTR?\n\nI kind of assume LoTR gives the purchase more waste, but thats just my gut insitnct, i has no basis in fact.\n\nI think maybe, I am kind of hoping this excessive waste will stop people buying multiple core sets thereby forcing FFG to provide a core set expansion that just provides enough cards to bring up each p[layer card to the  full 3 quota! Even though they haven't done this with other LCGs....\n\nI can but dream! corazon_roto.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/corazon_roto.gif]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45136-core-set-math/?do=findComment&comment=452713","commentId":452713,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1302607431,"content":"I have two copies of AGoT and very little of it has gone to waste other than the title cards.
