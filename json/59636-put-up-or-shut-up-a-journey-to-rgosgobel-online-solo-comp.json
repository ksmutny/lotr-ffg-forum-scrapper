Lord of the Rings is my first experience with deck building games and I definitely do not consider myself an expert deck builder so I expect there is much I could do better to improve my win % significantly.  \n\nPersonally, I like a difficult challenge, provided a win is not impossible so I find the difficulty just right for me.  I enjoy learning and seeing the results as my deck building skills increase, as well as discovering more optimal strategies for dealing with each specific quest. I also like the fact that playing as a solo player, the decks and strategies really need to be tailored to each specific quest and I also like to see the impact that the new cards have on quests previously played using the restricted rules.\n\nThat being said, if I was going to play competitively then there is no doubt I would want 3 copies of some of the key cards.\n\nEveryone has different tastes so there is no right answer for everyone, but my advice would be if you like a challenge and aren't going to be playing competitive tournaments than no need to get a second core set.  If you don't enjoy losing a significant amount of the time and don't enjoy fiddling with your deck but want to play solo then I would recommend staying away from the quests with a difficulty higher than 5 (or just play those ones with 2 or more players).\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59636-put-up-or-shut-up-a-journey-to-rgosgobel-online-solo-comp/?do=findComment&comment=585882","commentId":585882,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1327693314,"content":"Well this isn't a \"completion\".. it is just a friendly game, to see exactly what people are saying...

Yes. Is it still hard after you gained some experience? Less so.\n\n \n\nI think the one Core Set restriction has a big impact on the difficulty of the quest, not like \"If you can win it\", but \"how reliable do you win it\". A third copy of Sneak Attack, Steward of Gondor, A Test of Will and other cards will go a long way of making you win more reliable.\n\n \n\nThat being said, I consider myself in the \"quest is not too hard\" corner (but I honestly don't know how hard it is with one Core Set, I have two). So I would like to put my hat in the ring and play some games with your restrictions. But instead of just posting some scores, maybe someone here is willing to meet up with me while I play those games on LackeyCCG (Tragic should be releasing JtR sometime early February, right?).\n\n \n\nJust two questions upfront: Winning consistently trumps any score, right?

Not because I care about any side (JtR is too easy or JtR is too hard), but simply because it makes for a challenge and an occasion to compare scores and results with other players.\n\nI bought each expansion as it came out and have played with 3 Core sets since before The Hunt for Gollum was released, but I went for a long period without playing. By the time I tried JtR for the first time, I had all the Mirkwood cycle of AP. I used my Lore deck (Beravor, Bilbo, Denethor using Songs to splash) and got destroyed on my first try. That was a generic deck designed to do well against any quest (and it worked up to that point). But ahainst JtR, I was always behind with that eagle. The clock is fast in this quest! My second try was with a friend in 2 players (Gimli-Eowyn-Brand / Bilbo-Beravor-Gloin) and we won easily. The fact that we got 2 Athelas in the first 2 turns was a major point (and I had added Lore of Imladris to my deck, a card I didn't play before this quest came out).\n\nI then only played it a few more times. Once as a 4 player team (won in 3 or 4 turns), once as a 2 player team with the Zigil deck (again, a fast and easy win) and a few times this weekend as part of Zjb12's tournament, which doesn't really count since I won it in 2 turns each time.\n\nSo, I'm looking forward to trying this. I must say those challenges of playing with a single Core set make for a change, but I'll probably tire of them soon. Maybe I'm lazy, but I do enjoy having my 3-of for most spells (A Test of Will, Galadhrim's Greetings), especialy Unexpected Courage. Having 3 or only 1 of that attachment completely changes the game (obviously, the game is easier with 3).\n\nI built 2 decks to try. One is Spirit / Lore (Eowyn, Eleanor, Denethor). I already tried 2 games and loss both. I'm always a turn late in getting an Athelas or my Lore of Imladris. I'll post complete results later.\n\nThe second deck is built to fight. I use Eleanor, Frodo and Legolas. I splash Lore for Lore of Imladris, but the rest includes more Eagles and ranged allies in order to better fight the enemies.\n\nMy assumption in both cases, after reviewing the encounter deck, is that you don't need major questing since most cards have only 1 or 2 threar (there's Necromancer's Pass and Ungoliant's Spawn as the exception). However, what I'm realizing now is that you still want a lot of questing speed to get to the end soon. Every turn is 2 more points of damage and you quickly run out of options. In my two tries, I had to use Lore of Imladris when Wyliador was up to 18 or 19 damage.\n\nI'm beginning to think you need a solid alignment of planets on this quest. As in: getting early Athelas and having the right cards in your hand. This reminds me of Escape from Dol Guldur (at least from the solo perspective) The quest becomes way easier the more players you have, since the clock on Wyliador doesn't scale, but you get to see more cards from the encounter deck and can thus get Athelas sooner (solo, you'll see 9 encounter cards before Wyliador dies; two players will see 18; etc.).\n\nAnyway, I hope to see other people post results and strategy. The fact that you can design a deck just for this quest should make it easier, but it doesn't make much of a difference right now for my tries."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59636-put-up-or-shut-up-a-journey-to-rgosgobel-online-solo-comp/?do=findComment&comment=586256","commentId":586256,"userName":"Caputo","timestamp":1327766817,"content":"Attempt 2: Fail\n\nGlorfindel died on turn 5 having taken 2 damage from the arrival of Dol Guldor Orcs on turn 4, swarming insects and festering wounds finished him off the next turn leaving the other two heroes to die a slow lingering death over the next 5 turns.  Bilbo died next on turn 7 from an undefendable Black Forest Bat and finally poor old Wilyadir succumbed to his wounds on turn 10, In spite of a Lore of Imladris and Denethor having 2 Athelas.  Basically it was an unlucky run of treacheries wot did me in."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59636-put-up-or-shut-up-a-journey-to-rgosgobel-online-solo-comp/?do=findComment&comment=586268","commentId":586268,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1327769116,"content":"I changed my deck for this before the rules were clarified.

That proved to be an issue for me in all games. My drawing engine was based on Ancient Mathom, so I needed early locations to activate it. Also, since I always needed one or two Lore of Imladris to win, that meant holding on to Lore resources on Denethor.\n\nGame # 3 - I had a sneaky Gandalf and Escort from Edoras to boost my questing power and I met locations which helped me fill my hand with all three Lore of Imladris. I also got a free Athelas when it was guarded by Driven by Shadows.\n\nGame # 4 - This was the most interesting one. I had one Athelas, 5 resources on Radagast, a second Athelas being guarded by Necromancer's Pass in the staging area, a Lore of Imladris in hand (but no resource on any hero), a Steward of Gondor on Eowyn and 14 wounds on Wyliador. I had to decide whether I traveled or not. I chose not to, not wanting to risk my Lore of Imladris. Instead, Wyliador went to 16 wounds while I played a Northern Tracker of the 4 spirit resources (1 from Eleanor, 3 from Eowyn). Wyliador went up to 18 resources on the next turn when I finished exploring the Pass with Northern Tracker, grabbed the Athelas and healed the eagle for 20.\n\nGame # 5 - The only Athelas I saw was guarded by a Chieftan Ufthak which prooved to strong for my army (Gandalf did his best to help from afar, but being alone, it wasn't enough).\n\nThoughts and ideas:\n\n- You want to finish this quest early. The worst situation is when you have enough resources to fully heal the eagle, but just can't get to the end of stage 2B. So that means heavy questing power. Cards such as Escort from Edoras becomes stronger than they usualy are.\n\n- There are 4 cards that can heal Wyliador: Lore of Imladris, Radagast, Glorfindel and Athelas. You want all 4 in multiple copies (well, not Glorfindel...). Cards that prevent damage to Wyliador should be seen in the same light: A Test of Will, Hasty Stroke, A Burning Brand (if you can have a ranged Lore hero), Eleanor and, to a lesser degree, Denethor and Unexpected Courage (and Common Cause).\n\n- Because you want to finish early, you won't have a lot of resources. It means each resource must be maximized. I'd remove cards such as The Galadhrim's Greetings and Protector of Lorien. Although \"good\" in a generic sens, these become less useful when you cannot afford to cast them (the only time I played GG was when I had already clinched my win in game 4, although I had it in all games). Protector could be considered if not playing Eowyn, but you'll see that you don't have enough cards to throw away to make it very effective.\n\nI'll try it with the other deck I spoke of earlier (Eleanor, Frodo, Legolas), but I don't expect any more success.\n\nI'll see if I feel like trying further later based on these findings."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59636-put-up-or-shut-up-a-journey-to-rgosgobel-online-solo-comp/?do=findComment&comment=586626","commentId":586626,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1327836903,"content":"SiCK_Boy said:\n\n \n\n- Because you want to finish early, you won't have a lot of resources.

It could be that I'm beginnig to get a feel for the quest itself. My games lasted longer; I often ended up using multiple Radagast to heal Wyliador and buy me a few turns. Game # 4 was a sad loss. I only realized afterward that Legolas's ability is a response (thus optional) and I could have killed a few enemies without problem. I was looking for my 3rd Lore of Imladris (used the other two earlier) and drew 6 cards off Ancient Mathoms with maybe 10 cards left in my deck, but still couldn't get one. I also searched a while for Athelas in that one; over half the encounter deck was passed before I found my first. But once I got the location that lets you fetch one, it was guarded by a second Athelas. Anyway, a great game that was.\n\nQuestion: If you get an Athelas and the guarding card is a Treachery that you cancel with Eleanor, will the replacement card still be guarding Athelas? I assume no, but I'm not certain.\n\nAmongst the other comments I can make, that second deck performed better because I rarely felt I was overwhelmed by the encounter deck. Sure, Chieftan Ufthak is still a beast, but I could fight most enemies with Legolas and was letting undefended attacks go through, confident in Frodo's ability to survive. I also got Steward of Gondor out early in most games; having the 3 Song of Kings was critical. One of the issues I have, however, is the amount of \"unused\" cards I ended with (extra copies of Songs, Tactics allies I couldn't play). Maybe a Protector of Lorien would have been welcome after all...\n\nAmongst the changes I would make to this deck, there's the removal of Landroval and Horseback Archer. I'd certainly add a second Quick Strike and the third Westfold Horse-Breaker instead. The Blade of Gondolin never showed its use. A third Stand and Fight would be better, I think.\n\nI may give this one a last try, with a Glorfindel / Eleanor / Beravor deck (splashing Leadership for Sneak Attack and Steward of Gondor). After that, enough!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59636-put-up-or-shut-up-a-journey-to-rgosgobel-online-solo-comp/?do=findComment&comment=586709","commentId":586709,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1327848492,"content":"I am having a lot of fun with this myself..

I believe I have built a deck that is as good as possible be given the restrictions AND the direction I chose for deck building. I will go though the deck and explain it.. and with a few modifications though the addition of the cards from the entire Mirkwood cycle, witch are banned in this challenge, this deck and the strategy that goes with it reaches, nearly, a perfect win ratio.\n\nStill, ironically the fact that this deck is so \"safe\" is also its downfall, and strange as it may sound a more risky deck, might have a better chance of seceding with a higher win ratio. I know that sounds off.. but bear with me. You see this deck is designed to cope with the crazy when revealed effects in this quest, the 2 super monsters (Spawn and Chief) as well as the Condition Attachment effect and shadow effects. So this deck fears not all that crazy draw. It is meant to cope with these upsets, and it copes VERY well. Running this deck properly is a bit complex, as you need a honed threat assessment, but you are fairly certain to always get to near the end of 2B. The problem is that by being able to cope with everything, it is also weak in other key areas, areas you can not shore up with out making it susceptible to surprise draws. This was frustrating the hell out of me, and I have come to the conclusion that the way to get around this is to build a deck that IS open to disaster on certain draws. Rather than trying to be able to cope with everything. My hope is that by completely ignoring some threats I will increase the chance of winning when those threats do not show up.. meaning a guaranteed loss if they do, but if they do not .. maybe more chance of a win... As the threats are spread out and rareish... I think there is the possibility of increasing the win ratio by doing this.. by doing what is essentially building a \"worse\" deck.. pretty interesting I think..\n\nHere is the deck that I have been running, and would greatly like any input you care to give....\n\nHeroes\n\n(T) Legolas\n\n * This guys is in fact the key quester of this deck, though enemy kills using his ability combo'd with duel Blade of Gondolin. He can bock and attack those common bats and crows, as well as cast key Tactic Sphere defensive tricks, like Feint and Winged Guardian.\n\n(S) Eleanor\n\n\n * She is the real hero in this deck, her ability to cancel the treachery cards is key. Nearly every single treachery will end the game in one move. We are only allowed 2 Test of Wills, and 1 Tomb, so using these cards just isn't enough. In my test games drawing 3 treachery in a row was common. I honestly can not see how this quest is even remotely achievable with out her. As well as canceling, she is able to speed up the encounter deck draw, as each cancel draws a new card witch is critical to getting those healing objective cards.\n\n(L) Bilbo Baggins\n\n * This guy is a card draw machine. I strongly feel that with Elenore as the UC target, for treachery canceling and only one UC able to be used, that Bilbo far exceeds Beravore for card draw. As he can draw an extra card every turn regardless of how you use him, in the long run over the course of the game he will always draw more than Beravore, though it is true that if you play Beravore correctly (as in tapping at end of turn) you can draw your 2 cards then, 1 from refresh and have the ability to draw an extra two strait away when you are digging for a card. This is Bilbos weakness, he speeds up card draw but he is not a digger, and if you get to the end of the quest and haven't the heals, each turn putting 2 wounds, Bilbos effect can not really cut it. Still, with Legolas defending or attacking and Elenore untapped for treachery protection, you want your 3rd hero questing all the time, with makes Beravore tap ability useless. So that is why Bilbo\n\nI'll list the deck at the end.. but first lets talk strategy.\n\n3x Westfold Horse-Breaker\n\n\n * Is a gold mine... at cost of 2 you get 1 will. That isn't much.. but remember the encounter deck starts at 1, and reveals 1 at a time, so after you can quest for around 4-6... that is ALL you need to keep on top of the questing. What is great about this character is that you can discard it to untap Elenore to get an extra cancel running, or for a surprise attack by un-tapping Legolas. This card is a life saver, so much utility and I can not count the times it has completely saved the day.\n\n1x Henamarth Riversong\n\n\n * As we can only use 1 copy of core (I own 3 btw) I am shocked at how hard this game is with only 1 copy of this complete legend. Being able to see what is coming in the encounter deck is just ... I dunno.. I can not express how great that is. Easily THE best card to get near the start of the game. So integral to the deck, that I have even placed a stand and fight in to bring back Zombie Rivedrsong in the late game.\n\n2x Miner of the Iron Hills\n\n\n * There is a condition attachment that stops you form untapping. These guys simply let me get rid of it. You can also sack this guy in a ground attack if you wish to bring him back with Stand and Fight. 2 is possibly too many copies as it is a rareish occurrence, and is an example of what I was saying at the start about this deck being \"too\" prepared.\n\n2x Forest Snare / 2x Feint\n\n\n * There is a Chieftain, a Spawn and 2x Dol Orcs in this set.. The 1st 2 will wreak you, though I have removed them a few times, but the Dol Orcs even though easy to kill get 2 shadow cards, and the shadow cards are deadly. There is the +3 dmg to Wilyador card.. witch effectually decreased your clock in the game by a turn.. and there is the +1 Wound to all exhausted Characters this kills most allies.. and you have to remember that you tap to defend, so often this will kill the defender, leaving the attack undefended.. brutal. Then there is also the +1 dmg to all wounded characters.. again.. this can wipe the entire board. So the Dol Orcs, are in fact more scary to me in some ways.. they are seen more often and the shadow effects are very scary. Still with the snare and feint even unstoppable monsters like the spawn can be dealt with pretty easily.\n\n2x Sneak Attack / 1x Gandalf\n\n\n * Threat is not an issue in this quest.. if you get to 50 threat.. it is game over anyway. There simply isn't time for threat gain to be an issue. Still, one of the great problems in this quest is having being ready to win but not having the healing, and sneak attack Gandalf for +3 cards is super cool. You only need to dig in your deck near the end, so we can rely on Bilbo to draw our Gandalf by then we have the sneaks and a instant 6 cards.. right when we need them most. I'm currently adding 2 Radagast, 1 Gandalf, though 2 will increase the draw chance of this combo.. but in all honestly, I have rarely needed Gandalf for anything else. I feel that there is a good chance of him being in hand at the end of the game when you need to dig.\n\nMinstrel, Steward + Songs.\n\n\n * Well, Steward of Gondor is, well.. it is Steward.. we want this cards as soon as possible. The 3xMinstrels allow us to get the song of kings out at a decent speed with out filling our deck with songs. They also quest for +2 .. witch is awesome. You want to place Kings on Legolas. There are few tactic cards, so he finds it hard to spend, until Winged Guardian gets out and then he starts spending a resource a turn almost, so his resource gain really slows. There are cards that key of attachments, so it is also important to get an attachment on all heroes. Then get Steward and Song of Lore on Elenore. Getting the song on Elenore allows you to cast the higher cost lore cards faster, and steward helps that as well, but also it allows you to often have spare spirit for test of will and Hasty stroke.\n\nBasic Usage\n\n\n * I can not teach you in this post how to play the deck.. just try it out.. You want to NEVER quest with Elenore and use her ability to Cancel and speed up the encounter draw. Questing is mainly achieved though Legolas until mid game when your Minstrels and Rada is out. Save the Escorts for mid game to do super questing +4 for 2 mana.. early game you want Horse Breaker instead to give utility to your heroes. To kill Crows in one turn you need to attack with Legolas AND Wilyador. Wilyador can defend bats most times with no damage. Save Hasty Strokes for +1 dmg shadow cards to taped/wounded. Test of will you will want to cast a lot.. try and resist.. rule is if you can survive the card.. do not use it. When a card comes that will kill you, you want to have ready, like say +2 dmg to one questing character for example... Speaking of that.. play careful.. try to keep 1 resource on Spirit at all times for cancels and on tactics to keep your Guardian alive.\n\nSo yeah.. that is the main deck... here is the deck list as well as the scratch pad.\n\nTactics\n\n3 Winged Guardian\n2 Blade of Gondolin\n2 Feint\n\nSpirit\n\n3 Escort from Edoras\n1 Lorien Guide\n3 Westfold Horse-Breaker\n3 Ancient Mathom\n1 Unexpected Courage\n2 A Test of Will\n2 Hasty Stroke\n1 Stand and Fight\n\nLeadership\n\n2 Steward of Gondor\n2 Sneak Attack\n\nLore\n\n3 Daughter of the Nimrodel\n2 Gleowine\n1 Henamarth Riversong\n2 Miner of the Iron Hills\n3 Rivendell Minstrel\n2 Forest Snare\n2 Protector of Lorien\n3 Lore of Imladris\n\nNeutral\n\n1 Gandalf\n2 Radagast\n1 Song of Kings\n1 Song of Wisdom\n\nScratch Pad\n\n\nHorseback Archer - To expensive, once winged guardian is out, he builds resources so slowly.\nErebor Hammersmith - The discard attachment shadow card is rare.. only 1 instant in entire deck.. this is over kill.. best to just hope you do not see it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\nHaldir of Lorien - To expensive\nLongbeard Map-Maker - Hard choice.. still undecided... While his ability is crazy, I just never seamed to have the resources to exploit it.\nCelebrian's Stone - This is very good, but 1 card only allowed.. drawing 1 card in 50 is so random, you want it early and just can not reply on that.. I feel it is best left to make room for something with more utility i can count on.\nDunedain Mark - undecided as well, 1 more attack dose allow Legolas to kill crows in one go alone.. that makes a big difference. This can be placed back in...\nValiant Sacrifice - Card draw is so important in this quest, if you do not get your Heals, you will not win. Still, I found that this deck dealt with everything so well, I nvr really go to use it.\nDwarven Tomb - again, only 1 copy of this card.. seams hard to bank on. Sure it is basically a \"wild\" card for anything in the yard.. but in my most of my games when running it IF i drew it.. it was nvr used. Still there are good arguments for this card.\nInfighting - With the snares this is a great way to deal with Hummer Horns and other stuff. Simply snare Spawn or another high life creature and slowly load her with dmg, then you can instant kill creates coming off the encounter deck. In the long run though I felt that sneak attack and Gandalf was a better choice.\nLorien's Wealth - Card draw .. said it a few times already.. but yeah.. it makes or breaks this quest.. I decided to drop this for the sneak attack Gandalf thing die to that affectingly costing 2 less for the same effect as well as Gandalf having \"other\" uses.\nStrength of Will - I tried hard to get this card to work.. and when it did it was awesome, still in most cases I nvr got to use it and it was a dead draw. The idea is that as Elenore is not tapped during questing, if there is no treachery to cancel you can tap her and cast this for 0 and add 2 tokens... all good in theory.. but the reality of the convergence of not having her tapped and traveling at THAT same time.. and having the card in hand seamed to be hard to pull off.\n\n------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ --- -- ----------- --- ------ \n\nSo.. yeah.. this is my deck and the deck ideas... why do I think I need to go to drawing board? Well.. as I said the win ratio is pretty low.. I think I can do better.. one of the biggest problems is Legolas. While he allows me to deal with Bats and Crows (remember Wilyador can not even dmg crows) if there are no enemies getting pulled.. then it is game over, also if you are trying to stall the game to find the healing, then his ability and the blades will make him unable to attack anything, again.\n\nI have been having a great time tying to build this deck and think this is a pretty decent attempt at this challenge. I am going to start again fresh with a completely new deck idea... I'll get back to you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59636-put-up-or-shut-up-a-journey-to-rgosgobel-online-solo-comp/?do=findComment&comment=588157","commentId":588157,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1328081086,"content":"Pretty much like your deck, Tragic, although I would do some things different. I agree with you about Legolas, he's absolutely shining in this scenario. Eleanor seems like an obvious choice so I'm ok with including her, especially as this gives you access to the spirit resources. In my deck I replaced her with Denethor, who is not only able to deflect those treacheries, but also enemies that you don't like to meet with. But as much as I love Bilbo myself, I think this scenario calls for Glorfindel. He give you WP + attacking strength, he can take some undefended attacks and other damage stuff (DG Orcs) and he is able to heal that damage. Yes, this means a smaller cardpool, but if you'd add more Gandalfs you'd be able to get more cards in your hand (especially if you can play Ancient Mathom).\n\nPlaying a dual-sphere deck you could also set aside the leadership sphere, but add some Song of Travel to cover the spirit sphere. Lore should provide you with enough WP in the beginning, so you can wait for a while to grab a song to play those travel cards. Escort from Edoras is gold when it's late game and you want to finish 2B ASAP after you just got dealt the needed amount of Athelas. Haldir could be played in round 2 already, so that the DG Orcs should pose no threat.\n\nLegolas' resources will be saved for neutral cards and, attached with SoT, for spirit cards, so I agree with your apporach  to add a bare minimum of tactics cards.

I am currently looking at him this time around, though I find the protection from Elenore to be a bit safer. As her's is a \"response\" while Denathor's is \"action\".\n\nThis means that he can scry but only at action speed, so after you commit to a quest it is to late for him to scry again. There is no action window between the card reveals. What this means is that you can not scry and see a Athelas, go sweet, I'll keep that, then quest, reveal it, then untap and scry with Denathor again before you add the guarded card. While Eleneor can protect during this window. There are other examples as well. If you complete the traveled location of \"Forest Grove\" you have a may event to search the deck for a Athelas and add it to the staging area, this then gets a guarded card, but there is no action phase for you to scry between placing the Athelas and drawing the card. Opening yourself to death from treachery. Another miss use people use Denathor for is scrying shadow cards. You may scry b4 the first card is revealed but with Orcs, you are unable to do so before the 2nd card.. not really related to Elenore, but just thought I would mention it.\n\nleptokurt said:\n\nBut as much as I love Bilbo myself, I think this scenario calls for Glorfindel.

Yes, this means a smaller cardpool, but if you'd add more Gandalfs you'd be able to get more cards in your hand (especially if you can play Ancient Mathom).\n\n\n\nYes, defiantly. Glorfindel is on my list for the new deck. I am not normally a fan of him due to his crazy start threat. You are looking at a 37-30ish start threat when running this guy. Still as you say he has some good tricks on him and in honestly I think that 1 point of heal is relevant during the final push.\n\nleptokurt said:\n\nadd some Song of Travel to cover the spirit sphere\n\n\n\nCard is illegal. This challenge is meant to simulate the game state when aJTR came out. From reading many posts on here and BBG at the time, I think that was when the game lost many casual solo players. The rage of 17th Knight that prompted Boored to do this challenge is a pale reflection of the outrage that rippled across BGG. Still.. we are talking about 1 copy of Core + the APs up to aJTR.\nleptokurt said:\n\nI think you have to use Bilbo in the beginning to make at least some progress. Tragic's deck has Eleanor to eliminate most of the vital threats, but that's unfortunatly not a 100 percent guarantee, especially as she is helpless against the DG Orcs' effect which is why I think Glorfindel is better suited than Bilbo in this adventure.\n\n\nWhen running Elenore you are free to save the Test of Wills for this alone... .. . Still you only need to quest for 4-6 at a time if you have teh stanging area under control. So by mid game you should not be questing with any heroes.\n\n\nRGun said:\n\nCurious, I haven't heard anyone talk about using the 2B quest action to take 3 cards from encounter deck and add 1 to staging area.\n\n\n\n\nI do not think this is viable for solo play, the clock is super fast as it is, though this ability really useful in 2+ player games were you can run 6+ Imladris's (as everyone owns 1 core set). When you have 30 healing off Imladris alone in your deck the quest is a LOT easier!! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59636-put-up-or-shut-up-a-journey-to-rgosgobel-online-solo-comp/?do=findComment&comment=588457","commentId":588457,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1328115002,"content":"Surge is another good example of Eleanor's superiority to Denathor, as there is no action window b4 the surge card is revealed, so he can not stop somthing bad coming then, while Eleanor can."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59636-put-up-or-shut-up-a-journey-to-rgosgobel-online-solo-comp/?do=findComment&comment=588487","commentId":588487,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1328117617,"content":"Westfold Horse-Breaker isn't of much use with Eleanor.
