Hmmmmmm....\n\n \n\nAwesome competition by the way :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I may partake when I get some time"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107493-to-kill-a-mumak/?do=findComment&comment=1102713","commentId":1102713,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1401424878,"content":"> So you can recreate the 'iconic' moment from the movies where Legolas just goes nuts on a mumak or two.\n\nExactly, especially since Legolas is one of the best to put the blade on and then he kills things in crazy ways!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107493-to-kill-a-mumak/?do=findComment&comment=1102714","commentId":1102714,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1401424962,"content":"thats a great combo. bravo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107493-to-kill-a-mumak/?do=findComment&comment=1102721","commentId":1102721,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1401425518,"content":"And yeah, two blades on one character is not good since many enemies have 3 or less shield.

And considering many people have crazy different play styles, not everyone's going to do this nor will it necessarily work for you could get terrible card draw and the combo never comes up or you may be defeated in the quest even if you do kill the Mumak.
