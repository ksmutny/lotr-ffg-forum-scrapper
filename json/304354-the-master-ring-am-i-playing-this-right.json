The Guarded X keyword does not reveal encounter cards - you are instructed to discard from the deck until you find a card of the right kind and then attach it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304354-the-master-ring-am-i-playing-this-right/?do=findComment&comment=3868151","commentId":3868151,"userName":"RogueSeventeen","timestamp":1578710150,"content":"Interesting, so the When Revealed effects of enemies or locations attached to guarded cards do no resolve."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304354-the-master-ring-am-i-playing-this-right/?do=findComment&comment=3868215","commentId":3868215,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1578716472,"content":"> 1 hour ago, RogueSeventeen said:\n> \n> Interesting, so the When Revealed effects of enemies or locations attached to guarded cards do no resolve.\n\nOne of the benefits of using guarded cards, if you can afford the added threat to staging. You can avoid really bad enemy reveals/surges this way."}]}
