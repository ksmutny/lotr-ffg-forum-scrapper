Or to be more precise, your Photoshop brush.\nCurrently I'm working on a variant project of a Campaign Mode [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/930659/campaign-mode] for this game, and it'll be based on a World-Map of Middle-Earth.\n\nWhat I need is someone who wishes to help. Someone who can draw one (or adapt one) map of Middle-Earth with some tweaks needed to function together with my future mode.\n\n\nYou can answer here, send PM or even mail me (cordeirooo@gmail.com).\nThe latter is the fastest contact.\n\n\nThank you!"}]}
