Grimbold would be fun, and would allow for a Gandalf-Erkenbrand-Grimbold deck that represents the reinforcements, together with a Théoden-Éomer-Gimli deck (perhaps subbing in a new version of Legolas, since Tactics hero Legolas is horrible at this quest). Grimbold was known for his valour and was an important commander at the Fords of Isen and at the battle of Pellinor Fields: he's the most significant Rohan character that we haven't yet seen. Hero Gamling (which seems unlikely so soon after the ally, but would allow some combination of Théoden, Éomer, Háma, Gamling, Gimli and Legolas as heroes) or an FFG-created Rohan hero could also work. I could always play Helm's Deep solo, but that feels much less epic.\n\n \n\nMore broadly, I'd like more support for secrecy and tricksy ways to deal with enemies, ideally themed so that it doesn't clash with hobbits (A Elbereth Githoniel works, but not Ride Them Down). During the Grey Company's book club discussion of A Shadow of the Past, they mentioned that it's unthematic that the quest essentially forces you to fight the black riders. Obviously it's tricky to balance powerful effects like A Elbereth Githoniel, but I'm hoping the sixth saga box (which we might get this year) will include some powerful events and attachments to support players who want their decks to be more focused on Frodo and Sam than high-threat heroes and an army of allies.

And Bill the Pony before that? And before that it was all the way back in Mirkwood. Would love to see more creatures introduced.\n\n \n\nMaybe more Eagles, but I would love to see other animals as well. There are a lot of forest creatures that could fit the bill--maybe some wolves or hounds as a counterpoints to the wargs. Giant boar, stags, elk, moose or bears could all conceivably be very dangerous in combat. Or even things like moths that could be used to scout the encounter deck or deliver messages (exchange cards or resources). \n\n \n\nAnd if we are going to see the return of creatures there would be no better time for the return of Radagast. I've already talked in more detail about how much I would love a new Radagsat hero elsewhere but something like this could be awesome:\n\n \n\nNeutral Hero. [11-threat cost]. 3/2/2/4. Resources from Radagast's resource pool may be used to pay costs associated with any Creature, Mount, or Eagle card. Action: Exhaust Radagast to put a Creature ally from your hand into play. That ally gains: \"At the end of the round, shuffle this card back into your deck.\"\n\n \n\nAdd in a Radagast spell and attachment ala the Gandalf treatment (perhaps a staff or cloak for the attachment and some kind of creature related buff or summon for the spell) and you would have a very solid Hero that works both mechanically and, I think, thematically. His power isn't the best in the world but it works to facilitate existing creature effects and it makes sense that the beasts of Middle-Earth would come to his aid. \n\n \n\nAnd remember, Radagast and Gandalf could share spells as Flame of Arnor is not limited to Gandalf. \n\nEdited January 4, 2016 by JonofPDX"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197489-2016-wishespredictions/?do=findComment&comment=1978195","commentId":1978195,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1452251571,"content":"Elladan & Elrohir allies to match each other's Hero card sphere."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197489-2016-wishespredictions/?do=findComment&comment=1979001","commentId":1979001,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1452279387,"content":"> Elladan & Elrohir allies to match each other's Hero card sphere.\n\n \n\nThat would be awesome.

So apparently in Flight of the Stormcaller we are looking for a stolen artifact from a pirate. In The Thing in the Depths, we encounter and team up with the pirates, and in the article for Temple of the Deceived we know we have a key for a hidden chest. Is the key the artifact? If so, after finding the chest we will unlock no doubt something out of the chest. It would be cool if whatever object the chest holds then becomes an objective attachment, just like an objective ally, for the rest of the cycle. That would be so cool. And since apparently Sahír is an objective ally in Temple, we will be accopaining him in looking for the chest. Maybe at the end of that scenario he will turn on us to take the chest himself, and we fight to fight him as a boss enemy. That way we would not have so many objectives as well."}]}
