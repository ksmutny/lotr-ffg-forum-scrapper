Afraid that it will get even easier with new adventure packs :(","comments":[{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48124-first-impressions-game-too-easy-afraid-that-it-will-get-even-easier-with-new-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=482742","commentId":482742,"userName":"DeeJay507","timestamp":1307604242,"content":"Hello,\n\nSince I have found out that a lot of ppl complains about game being too hard I was wondering what my group does wrong.\n\nHere are games we tried so far:\n\n4 player (core decks) against scenario #1 (we won on turn 3).\n\n3 players (core spirit, lore and leadership) against scenario #1 (we won, however it was a little harder without support of tactics)\n\n3 players (core spirit, lore and leadership) against scenario #2 (we won, final score: 88)\n\n1 player (core lore) against scenario #1 x3 (3 times won)\n\n1 player (core spirit) against scenario #1 (I won)\n\n1 player (core leadership) against scenario #1 (I won)\n\n1 player (spirit/lore 50 card deck: Beravor, Dunhere, Eowyn) against scenario #2 (I won, final score: 8)\n\nThe scenario nr 2 is broken. You can grind it and make an infinite combo that constantly lowers your threat. Effectivaly scoring for as much victory points as there is in the deck and having threat equal to 0 (or if it is possible to lower your threat below 0 -> -infinity).\n\nThe combo description: Berawor with Unexpected Courage. Gleowyn. Draw your entire library. Use Will of the West. Draw entire library again. Then use Ghlardim's and Gandalfs. Will of the West. Draw, and so on. You can do that in the final step of the quest, while having 1 enemy in the staging area with engagement cost higher than your threat. New cards will not be put into staging area and so you don't have to do anything besides questing for 2. \n\nSo, finally I gave a try to mono tactics scenario #1. \n\nAnd finally I have lost. At first it seemed impossible to beat since I have only 5 willpower in my deck, combining all heroes and Beorn ally. Since I have only 1 Beorn and it cost 6, I have usually 4 willpower. Since scenario 1 starts with 3 threat on table and draws additional card, I'm in big trouble. After several tries, I have won. It seems like tactics is great support deck but weak on its own. It has unnecessary attack and defence power, while lacks of most important willpower. Without Legolas abilities it wouldn't be possible to beat anything with this deck. However it is nice challange. The problem is that if I start building a deck with it, it will again be overpowered.\n\nSoon we will try scenario # 3 (with 4 of 3 ppl). If we don't finally lose this game, I'm worried about the game's future.\n\nI mean, we soon get a lot of new cards and the new scenario has difficulty 4.... means Extremally easy to beat with random trash. The more adventure packs I buy, the more powerfull decks I have, but the encounters will be kept at a level so low, that the players with core set are able to beat them. This means that already an easy game will become pointless to play.\n\nMy question and hope is that we don't understand rules, or do something wrong. Could players that have troubles with the game post what are they difficulties and what causes them to lose the games?\n\nOtherwise we will try to rescue the game maybe by introducing an \"evil player\" that will play using the encounter deck. Instead of random cards he would have several cards as an options to play. We would have to change effects of cards: look at the top card of encounter deck as look at random card from \"evil player\" hand. But except that, It should be ok. Maybe this will make a game at least little more challenging to play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48124-first-impressions-game-too-easy-afraid-that-it-will-get-even-easier-with-new-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=482782","commentId":482782,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1307608680,"content":"I've heard the game is extremely easy with 3-4 players because it doesn't scale properly.

It is almost impossible for solo players, because you lose a hero to start with and with the need to reveal cards for the objectives you can fall behind very quickly and never recover. I came very close to passing it solo once, besides that I haven't come close. This one will pose the bigest challenge coop because it seems it was made for more than one player. However, I can see that already with two players, it makes a huge difference. You will have 5 heroes available as opposed to 2, at the beginning. You can deal with whatever you pull out with the objectives more effectively. So, two players already have a great deal of advantages over one. As for 3-4 players, I would be surprised if this scenario proves too tough for them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48124-first-impressions-game-too-easy-afraid-that-it-will-get-even-easier-with-new-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=482849","commentId":482849,"userName":"DeeJay507","timestamp":1307614467,"content":"Thanks for your suggestions.\n\nI'll try to beat scenario 2 with something different than Spirit.\n\nI'll also try to play scenario 2 with 2 players.\n\nHowever, it disturbs me a little that we have a game where I have to intentionally cripple myself to even the chances.(by either not using certain cards for certain scenario or can't play certain scenarios with certain number of players.) If that is the case, there should be a hint on scenarios (best for X players). Or a list of restricted/banned cards for certain scenario.\n\nWhat disturbs me more is the upcoming adventure pack. I heard that the difficulty of the new scenario in there is 4, (I expected 10 or more) which is the same as the Scenario #2 in the core set. However, we will get more player cards for each sphere. This can potentally make player costructed decks even more deadly, while scenarios remain at the same level. Will I then have to limit myself to using only cards from core set to have fun and not overkill the scenarios?\n\nOn the other hand, if in future adventure pack, scenario that is very hard (like difficulty 20)  for players with decks built from all adventure packs, players will complain about it that they have to buy all adventure packs in order to beat it.\n\nI'm wondering how tournaments will look like :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48124-first-impressions-game-too-easy-afraid-that-it-will-get-even-easier-with-new-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=482857","commentId":482857,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1307614949,"content":"Scenario 3 has a difficulty 7 and you can win it solo after 30 games and only with luck and you want a scenario with 10 difficulty?Sometimes i can't understand people."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48124-first-impressions-game-too-easy-afraid-that-it-will-get-even-easier-with-new-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=482870","commentId":482870,"userName":"DeeJay507","timestamp":1307615820,"content":"@servant of the secret fire:\n\nok, so scenario 3 is hard to solo.

I'm personnally glad that the first one will be easy enough. A major part of the enjoyment I get of this game is the storytelling aspect and immersion in the universe of Middle-Earth. Victory is fun, but not the ultimate end.\n\nOne thing that I believe we'll see more of is fan-made scenarios. Because the expansion packs are self-contained, they'll always make use only of encounter cards from that specific expansion plus the core set. This will limit FFG's options. However, I'm sure fans will try to combine the encounter cards from multiple expansions and produce different (and, if there's a demand for it, harder) scenarios.

I just build up deck try to thinking about all aspects of the game. And the killer deck cannot exist in good balanced game. Here is lot of mistakes of the designers.\n\nYes you can have a good deck but...... you cannot win 90 %!!!! this is not right sorry!!!! There is problem with balance. What encounter deck can make against you if you have half on the deck in your hand and lot of resources???? Right nothing. So this is boring becouse in the game in the basements there is fondations mistakes. There is so much draw without any restrictions. I waiting for tournaments!!! I want to see different ideas of decks and strategys. But for now is not much of them and game on the tournaments is just about the schores.  We play to win or to make our threat level zero??? The game must give you feeling of the fight and dangerous journey, you must to feel fear of the enemies. But here i just thing how to get points from him.  And this is Tolkien!!!!\n\n \n\nYesterday we play with my friends coop. Crazy we cannot lose. Ok yes you can reveal more encounter cards in staging but i wonna play by rules, i prepare my self for serious tournaments, playing worldcups and nationals. I use to do it for years when i use to play Magic and Lotr tcg form Decipher. So as i say if they don make better balance of the game this game will be only for home fun play.

Or probably let speak about other low cost/high value events? Some are included only 1 or 2 times in the core set, for a reason I assume? Or as asked before, does the cost for those high event cards equalize the fact that they are very good, means, it wouldn't make any sense to only include high cost cards into your deck?\n\nSorry for bogging so much and asking noob questions, but its something me as a beginner doesn't get yet completely. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\ncherrs,\nIver"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48124-first-impressions-game-too-easy-afraid-that-it-will-get-even-easier-with-new-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=492173","commentId":492173,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1309252542,"content":"Iver said:\n\nGlaurung said:\n\n \n\n \n\nHmmmm yes there is few of them.

She can make in 1 round 4 resources.\n\nP.S. i have some chat with the guy who is get already Hunt for Gollum. He say is really difficult and interessting. Dont worry man this is difficult 4. But of you compare core scenarios this difficult 7 up. Im happy.\n\n \n\n \n\nCool news man regarding Gollum!\n\nguys, another thing i always wonder is how u manage to get so many cards on your hand?  Played the Anduin recently with two players and we got something around 12-15 cards out max! is it that important/crucial to have a lot of cards on your hand? for me it was so far just luck if you got good cards out of your deck actually, with a quite low probability....\n\nGlaurung said:\n\n \n\nI own 2 sets and my friend own 2 sets too. There is doesn matter how many sets you own. We talking about balance of the game.\n\n \n\n \n\nHmm, well would say it does matter  how many Gandalf for instance you have on your hand. Or probably let speak about other low cost/high value events? Some are included only 1 or 2 times in the core set, for a reason I assume? Or as asked before, does the cost for those high event cards equalize the fact that they are very good, means, it wouldn't make any sense to only include high cost cards into your deck?\n\nSorry for bogging so much and asking noob questions, but its something me as a beginner doesn't get yet completely. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\ncherrs,\nIver\n\nWhen you build up your deck first you must to have your idea and strategy than you think what cards you need to make it. And than you must to understand how the spheres of this cards combine together and cost of the cards must be also balanced.  Or you start from the heroes and chose them first and than start to think about the rest.\n\nIf you have not enough  Cards i mean only 1 version of U. courage or Dwarfen tomb. Just make a proxy. And try your strategy than if you decide go to tournaments with this deck buy single cards from internet. For example price of U. courage is 8usd Dwarfen Tomb about same.\n\n"}]}
