So I opted to play 2 well times ancient mathoms and got to draw 6 cards (didn´t get what I was looking for though).\n\nI had to wait a few rounds before playing those ancient mathoms however since 2 of the locations in play had the text \"all locations are immune to player card effects\" but afterwards I got to thinking: does that mean I cannot play attachments, like ancient mathom, on them?\n\nThe location doesn´t say \"no locations can have attachments played on them\" and ancient mathom doesn´t really affect the locations themselves (but are triggered by their state in the game), which makes the \"immune to player card effects\" a bit irrelevant in that regard. Anyway…\n\nImmune to player card effects = no attachments?\n\nWhat do you think?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79501-immune-to-player-card-effects-no-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=764536","commentId":764536,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1361248846,"content":"immune to player cards is fine with ancient mathom.
