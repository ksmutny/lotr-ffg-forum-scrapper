We get the first one in Q3 '13, my guess for the rest would be the following: Q1 '14, Q3 '14, Q1 '15, Q3 '15, Q4 '15. In this fashion, the end of 2015 could well mark the end of the active production of the game (sadly, but all things must end - in a way at least). We also seem to be getting a cycle per year, which would leave only one more cycle after the Ring-maker's one. This x-mas we get a deluxe, the next one again, the x-mas of 2015 we get the final saga.

Those two parts of the first book are widely regarded as more reminiscent of the hobbit (an adventure a chapter) and rather tangential to the overall all saga. The old forest in particular is often missed out in adaptations. \n\nIt's really at the two towers and onward after the fellowship is broken that we'll have the potential for more sagas. One's that follow Frodo and ones that's follow other parts of the fellowship. I think 3 would cover the fellowship (and I see why the barrow downs and old forest aren't included, though I hope to get them eventually, so why 2 would do). However I think that the other two books can't be done in only 2 sagas each.\n\nAs for 18 quests on a page - I really hope the formatting of their quest log isn't going to lead to them limiting their expansions for this game.
