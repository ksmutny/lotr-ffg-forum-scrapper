Then you may pay a resource to return Rumor of the Earth in your hand.\n\n \n\nFirst I thought its to have a peek of the encounter deck like Denethor/Riversong but then I realized \"reveal\" means put into play. Why someone should want to use a card/resource to increase the danger in the staging area? Sure, it could be used in conjunction with the neutral event coming in RtM (which puts the top discarded encounter card on top of the encounter deck) to get back lost objective cards, but this seems very situational.\n\nAny other ideas?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56461-rumor-of-the-earth/?do=findComment&comment=557657","commentId":557657,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1321693391,"content":"Well, of course I can only guess but I guess it will be the same thing as what Henamarth or Denethor do. Otherwise, I have no idea what it could be for, unless you really want to search the deck - like in Rhosgobel. I really doubt it though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56461-rumor-of-the-earth/?do=findComment&comment=557663","commentId":557663,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1321695171,"content":"ok, I checked the original post on the French board and it says \"look at\" not \"reveal\", the poster at BGG obviously translated it sloppily (google translator)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56461-rumor-of-the-earth/?do=findComment&comment=557664","commentId":557664,"userName":"Puzzle2","timestamp":1321695406,"content":"IMO this card is a strong play.

Allows you to save characters for other phases."}]}
