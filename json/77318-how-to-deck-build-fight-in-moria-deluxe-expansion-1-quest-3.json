You probably don't want to complete any quest stages unless you have to, until you can win the quest. Take advantage of putting the current quest card onto the bottom of the quest dack whenever you can, unless the current quest is useful to you. Cards which allow you to increase questing after the encounter cards are revealed are particularly useful.\n\nHope this helps!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77318-how-to-deck-build-fight-in-moria-deluxe-expansion-1-quest-3/?do=findComment&comment=747617","commentId":747617,"userName":"Captain Poe","timestamp":1358153765,"content":"If I recall correctly, I was able to beat this with Eowyn boromir, and a third hero (has been a long time). High questing power is a must, and bormir was able to save the day by readying to pick axe his way to freedom in one turn."}]}
