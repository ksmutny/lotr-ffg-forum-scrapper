Or is it nine not including the hero? I forget... \n\nIf the leadership hero isn't Noldor I really hope we get a leadership Noldor ally as we really don't have many of them at all. \n\nJust Galadriel, Erestor, Rivendell Scout (does anyone use this card???) and Warden of the Havens. Then again we only have 3 tactics allies that are Noldor..... so it would be nice to get another one of them in the near future as well.\n\n \n\nAlso what are people most looking forward to from this pack?\n\nI imagine for MANY people it will be ally Glorfindel. I am already looking at ways to replace Asfaloth effectively so that using the Glorfindel ally is actually a possibility.\n\nI personally, from the cards spoiled so far, am most excited to get Azain Silverbeard. Such a cost effective tactics ally, 3 resources for 3 attack and 2 defence and 2 hitpoints . In a pinch or desperate situation he can defend, he doesn't die to 1 damage to all characters effects and most important he does what he does extremely well. He attacks for 3 consistently and then for one tactics resource can do 2 direct damage! If you are running two tactics heroes and aren't running that many high cost tactics cards and mainly low cost allies and weapons/armour you might even be able to pay for and trigger this ability multiple turns in a row dishing lots of direct damage out!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217861-flight-of-the-stormcaller-is-finally-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2186517","commentId":2186517,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1461646249,"content":"I have been using Glorfindel ally proxy for an age.
