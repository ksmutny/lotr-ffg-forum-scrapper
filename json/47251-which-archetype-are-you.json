I can't stand to lose, I want the shadow to fall and I want it to fall hard. I will put the cards into my deck that will give me the best chance of victory. However, my choice for starting heroes is almost entirely story based. I love Dwarves and I love Rohan, so my first deck is built around some Dwarves and Rohan. It doesn't matter that Tac/Spirit is seen as weak, because that's what I like. Same for Beorn. I constantly think he might be too expensive, but I always include him, just because HE'S BEORN!\n\nThis is going to sound weird, but I'm not smart enough to be Pippin. I have to have people tell me card combos and will almost never be able to find them on my own. I do try to study the cards (that's also the Bilbo in me) but as much as I enjoy them, nothing pops out at me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47251-which-archetype-are-you/?do=findComment&comment=473621","commentId":473621,"userName":"DarthJalapeno","timestamp":1306205537,"content":"Bilbo > Pippin  > Boromir"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47251-which-archetype-are-you/?do=findComment&comment=473639","commentId":473639,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1306209280,"content":"I play because of the Bilbo aspect, currently mostly Tolkien-flavoured games only.

New cards just mean new permutations..and the small number of cards and small number of player cards released each month really feeds my Bilbo side for story...which in turn feeds my Pippin side of wanting to come up with every ridiculous combo ever."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47251-which-archetype-are-you/?do=findComment&comment=474214","commentId":474214,"userName":"Scoob4","timestamp":1306280525,"content":"I'm pretty heavy on both Bilbo and Pippin. If I play in tournaments I want to play with a deck that I've put together, not picked up from someone else. So that's the Pippin in me. I'm also the guy that made sure the quest cards were read at each stage of the quest, right in the middle of the game (and not sooner than the first game!) to feel like I was questing.\n\nOne of my friends is also a Pippin sort of player.

I can't say Decipher's game impressed me at all, as it failed to appeal to my inner Bilbo entirely. Movie stills? Really?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47251-which-archetype-are-you/?do=findComment&comment=474284","commentId":474284,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1306293694,"content":"Hmm. 50% Pippin, 30% Bilbo, 20% Boromir.\n\nI think\n\nAs people have said, it's hard to tell at this stage, with so little deck-building being done. In the other LCGs, I really like finding fun card combination, and things that can play off each other. Obviously, it's nice if it works, but not nice enough to make it worth putting in something that would never happen in the story (example for any AGoT players, you'd never have seen me running a Martell-Wildling Deck)\n\nBut realistically, I think it's going to take at least a full cycle of chapter packs to be sure of an LoTR specific build-style."}]}
