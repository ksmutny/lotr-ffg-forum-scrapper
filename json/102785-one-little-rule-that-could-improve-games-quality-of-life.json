It won't prevent an 1000 attack enemy from being revealed on the first turn and bashing your skull, but it'll help your strategy flow and being less dependant on initial card draw.

I at least think it was obvious that if you only need to place 1 card-to-rule-them-all (in case it is unique) in the deck then you make room for more cards by loosing the dead weight. I also thought that the steward of gondor example was very clearly only an example, so don´t get so hung up on that one card.\n\nAs well it is pretty obvious that if you choose to not play lore then you are electing to drop some aspects of the deck-building in favor of others. Could I by that same token use a heroes willpower or defense as attack value because \"not every deck can manage tactics\"?\n\nI think all of these things, if not directly implied in my somewhat short answer, then you could easily reach that conclusion by thinking about it just a little.

Also no-one has said there is an I-Win card but if you know for a fact that you can start with Light of Valinor, Steward of Gondor, Visionary Leadership, Master of the Forge or any other card you could think of then you are at a pretty big advantage in comparison to a regular game. Part of LotR is the luck of the draw; both from player and encounter deck.\n\nAnd sure, I can repeat myself for a 3rd time: play it the way you like. Just don´t expect an applause for making up a mechanic other people think is broken. For that matter you could mulligan 500 times instead of picking out a specific card but that would also be your own house-rule.

Yeah I very rarely will do this unless the hand is just atrocious or like you said soullos I've shuffled a million times already and am sick of it. Nine times out of ten though I simply play with the mulligan hand as technically doing another mulligan is a loss (conceding) and you are starting the scenario again...\n\nEdited April 1, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102785-one-little-rule-that-could-improve-games-quality-of-life/?do=findComment&comment=1035166","commentId":1035166,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1396394036,"content":"Not a bad idea for a creative spin on the game.

We have the chance to build our deck around these 3 without fear of never drawing them (unless they are imprisoned by the Necromancer!). There truly is no reason when you play by yourself not to mulligan until you see the card you want when playing solo. You can say that you lost all the games where you took more than one mulligan, and no one but you will ever know.\n\n \n\nIn a \"tournament\" setting, I think that it is more skill-testing not to have this rule. Sure the encounter deck can be randomly lethal early on, but in the long run, it is more interesting to me to see if I can win without seeing the Steward of Gondor or Gandalf in a given game. It makes it all the more enjoyable when that perfect game comes together and I crush a scenario."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102785-one-little-rule-that-could-improve-games-quality-of-life/?do=findComment&comment=1036809","commentId":1036809,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1396525264,"content":"Yeah, this idea is awful"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102785-one-little-rule-that-could-improve-games-quality-of-life/?do=findComment&comment=1036818","commentId":1036818,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1396526215,"content":"Don't say that, you hurt mah feelings :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102785-one-little-rule-that-could-improve-games-quality-of-life/?do=findComment&comment=1036880","commentId":1036880,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1396530792,"content":"The beautiful thing about this game is that you can play any way you want.  If a particular rule modification floats your boat, do it.  It's all good.  It is a game after all.\n\n \n\nMy personal rule mod is that if any heroes die or any players exit the game, the game is lost.  This keeps it more engaging for my friend and me who play together.  I think the heroes are kind of the DNA of your deck and without them, the experience isn't nearly as fulfilling.\n\n \n\nBut hey, to each his own!   :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"}]}
