I did it once but it took a great deck and a lot of luck.  However in multiplayer mode its a great thematic scenario.\n\n \n\nOnce you get good with the starters on the Passage Through Mirkwood scenario try some custom decks.  Early ones I enjoyed were:\n\n \n\nLore/Leadership (Beravor, Denethor, Gloin):  Idea's here.  Steward of Gondor for resources.  Beravor for card draw.  Gloin and Self Preservation or Lore of Imladris for resources.  If solo Henemarth Riversong to see what's coming.  Denethor to get bad cards off the top of the encounter deck or defend as necessary.  Gloin and Celebrian Stone for questing  Faramir for more questing power.  Radaghasts Cunning and Secret Paths to control what comes out of the encounter deck, Protector of Lorien for more questing power.\n\n \n\nTactics/Spirit (Eowyn, Dunhere, Thalin):  Galadhrim's greeting to keep threat low and engage enemies in the staging area with Dunhere.  Thalin quests to damage enemies and make Dunhere's job easier.  Allies to take hits as necessary.  A Test of Will to deal with most treachery.  Dwarven Tomb to bring back Gladhrim's Greeting or Test of Will when needed.  Dwarven Axes and Blades of Gondolin on Dunhere to make him hit harder.  Norther Tracker and Lorien Guide to deal with locations.\n\n \n\nThere are some ideas... give it some more goes... it gets easier.\n\n \n\nWraith428"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61603-to-ffg-bad-guys-op-good-guys-up/?do=findComment&comment=603813","commentId":603813,"userName":"player582283","timestamp":1331244558,"content":"Many veterans of the game would argue that multi-player, in general, is too easy.  Additionally, player decks will increase in power while existing scenarios' difficulty will remain static (barring expansions to add cards to increase their difficulty - a cool idea if you ask me).  With my play group, we'd be pretty shocked to lose one of the core scenarios."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61603-to-ffg-bad-guys-op-good-guys-up/?do=findComment&comment=603832","commentId":603832,"userName":"Arathorn299","timestamp":1331251980,"content":"which xpac is decent to get if your looking to beef up your deck?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61603-to-ffg-bad-guys-op-good-guys-up/?do=findComment&comment=603841","commentId":603841,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1331255482,"content":"The game gets easier as more cards get into your card pool... the core set has some of the best cards in the game but by itself is limited,.. and there is nothing wrong with this. This IS NOT a board game. This is a LCG witch is based on the way CCGs work. The game is designed for more cards... people expecting that the core set will play perfectly are asking that the core principle of the game be changed. It won't. If you are expecting this, then you have bought the wrong product.. it isn't a red pens fault that the ink is not blue.\n\nIf you want a self contained card game there are tons of options from lots of companies... FFG in fact make a ton of awesome stand alone card games witch play perfectly out of the box ... Death Angel, Chaos Gate or Rune Age are all boss, and Infiltration is a new one coming form the designer of Dominion.. arguably the best card game made in recent years (and one that invented a entire new genre for card games)\n\nMy point is that this is a LCG, it is meant to be supplemented by regular packs, the core principles of the game will not even be explored in core.. I mean we are a major expansion out and into the 2nd cycle and we still haven't seen even 1/2 of the common card effects from other ccg/lcg games... this game has tons of growing to do.\n\nCore set is to hard, and you do not want to buy new xpacs.. well guess what? you have bought the WRONG game.. next time do your research.\n\n> which xpac is decent to get if your looking to beef up your deck?\n\nThis is a very hard question... FFG is in the business of making money and to that end the \"good\" cards are spread all over the place.. buy a single pack is not going to change things to much.\n\nThere was a thread people put a lot of effort into b4 with all this information but I can not find it and can not be ****** retyping everything... but my general opinion is that buying the packs mostly in order is the best way...\n\nHunt of Gollum would be my recommendation. Has a the minstrels and a leadership song. Meaning that you can run tri or even 4 colour decks very very easily, and use a leadership as a splash for the resource engine. \"Most\" decks before khaz used card form this pack... it is a good pack to supplement your pool.. built like I said.. many many cards are only good cause of other cards... this is why often I think buying them in order is a good way to go.. at least to start, as FFG knows this in the design and the packs kind of add onto each other.\n\nAnother good option would be to get Khaz and Return to Mirkwood. This will enable you to play the darowdelf cycle, and give you access to Dain ... a key card in may decks. From there you can start collecting and power creep will mean tha you may not ever miss the early card from mirkwood."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61603-to-ffg-bad-guys-op-good-guys-up/?do=findComment&comment=603858","commentId":603858,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1331260889,"content":"wraith428 said:\n\nYou would not be the first to make such claims but let me assure you they will be proven false in time if you continue to play.\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely he will be proven wrong since he's referring to playing using a single core set solo.\n\nMy suggestion would be to play two player decks at the same time. My win percentage went up from 10%/3% (scenario2/3) to about 50% (slightly above for scenario 2 and slightly below for scenario 3) after making the switch.\n\nThe alternative would be getting additional core sets and the cards from the APs and Khazad Dum. With a larger card pool you can create a player deck that has a better chance of beating the scenarios.\n\nHowever, if you generally enjoy playing video games more than board or card games, this won't help you either."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61603-to-ffg-bad-guys-op-good-guys-up/?do=findComment&comment=603871","commentId":603871,"userName":"Arathorn299","timestamp":1331265077,"content":" \n\n\"Core set is to hard, and you do not want to buy new xpacs.. well guess what? you have bought the WRONG game.. next time do your research.\"\n\n \n\nbooored, I didn't mean to set you off into a nerd rage.  Sounds like you lack social contact with other human beings, but here's a tip, you don't help new players by being a jack ass on a forum.  So keep your mouth shut if you do not have anything productive to say.  I did my research by trying one of these games by FFG and I am not impressed, thats all I was saying.  I will get a few other x-pacs and give it some more time like Wraith428 suggested.  booored, have fun playing with yourself, sounds like you got a lot of practice at that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61603-to-ffg-bad-guys-op-good-guys-up/?do=findComment&comment=603876","commentId":603876,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1331267053,"content":"Start with Hunt for gollum.

They were obviously designed primarily for 2 players where the difficulty is about right. With 3 or 4 players, even the hardest Core Set scenario is a walk in the park if players halfway know what they are doing. For solo play, all of them are significantly harder, and the last one (Dol Guldur) is nigh impossible to win solo.\nMost of the quests in the adventure packs fare better in this regard (with the exception of Return to Mirkwood). If you stick with it and buy one or more adventure packs, your decks should be stronger, and you will have access to quests that are easier for solo players.\nStill, the game plays a lot better with 2 players IMHO. The balance is better, and all the discussions of what to do when is half the fun for me.\nAlso, your gaming background does matter quite a bit. If you have a CCG background and concepts like card advantage, resource management and quickly seeing what you need to play around and how to do it are second nature to you, the game will be significantly easier than for someone who never played any such games before.\nThis forum also has quite a few threads with good strategies for beating the second Core Set scenario consistently, even with just a single Core Set and nothing else.

Cose this will be really challenge to build up 2 mono decks to win all quests.Should be lore/spirit or tactic/spirit or leadership/spirit."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61603-to-ffg-bad-guys-op-good-guys-up/?do=findComment&comment=604387","commentId":604387,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1331411779,"content":"I think people have different ideas of what is hard.

For instance, if you really want a hard game and challenge everywhere, you can go for solo play. IMO, the couple of games I played solo were really tough, even if you only draw one encounter card. Two players can also be quite a challenge on some quests.\n\nFor those who want to kick back and relax, 3 or 4 players is usually more thrilling but easier most of the time. Even an additional encounter card can't compete with 3 more heroes and an additional hand of cards. Plus, you can cooperate, talk strategy, play single ressources deck and really feel like you have a specific and crucial role for the team.\n\nI remember that playing Journey along the Anduin with the core set alone or with two players was quite tough, almost impossible. However, I tried it with three players, and it was a breeze. Granted, the game can sometimes surprise you, but my take it : multiplayer (3 to 4) is more casual, but also more communicative and more fun. You're allowed to make mistakes in building your deck cause other players can pick up the slack. Solo or duo play is more about the challenge, building the best deck possible, managing the different ressource types.\n\nIn closing, I like the fact that LOTR has many quests of varying challenge level. I like it once in a while when a coop game kicks my ass...means more replay value for me. Other coop games you end up figuring them out and you can win reliably after a while (example : Shadows over Camelot, or even Arkham Horror). Ok, you can always buy Arkham expansions but they are pricy and they really make the game setup more tedious and the sheer amount of rules you have to remember becomes borderline annoying.\n\nI won't deny the game can be hard, but there's many ways to play it :-)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61603-to-ffg-bad-guys-op-good-guys-up/?do=findComment&comment=604624","commentId":604624,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1331525345,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\n \n\nThat's probably because wirtten text doesn't deliver all of your intentions - joking, arcasm, cynism etc. For what it's worth I don't think your post did cross any line, and yes, it was helpful.\n\n\n\nThere's a saying that booored should think about before posting: It's not what you say, but how you say it.\n\n\nWhenever I read one of his posts, it puts me on edge.

Lore was the sphere that caught my eye, followed by Tactics. I decided to make a deck with two Lore Heroes and a Tactics one. I picked Denethor as the prime defender (his ability is also perfect), Glorfindel as the prime quester (and additional healer) and Legolas as the prime attacker (and a contributor to questing via his ability). It seemed a solid choice at first. Then, I played the Passage scenario. I lost, though I was still learning the rules and, of course, I didn't mind. I played again and won. Then, I decided to buy the Hunt for Gollum AP for the Songs and the Minstrels to add a splash of Leadership to the deck so as to empower it and make it ready for the challenges ahead. I played Hunt for Gollum and, after a strong start, the adventure started taking its toll. I lost. Soundly. I played again. Lost again. Easily. I tried the Journey scenario from the CS. Lost.

Let me tell you, it's definitely not only the best sphere for solo questing, but something more. It's godly. I made a deck with Eowyn (quester), Dunhere (attacker) and Denethor (defender). I played the above scenarios. Defeated all. Without much hassle, save, strangely, the \"easiest\" one, the Passage. I defeated it of course each and every time I played it, but with a worse score that the other two, where I always won with a negative score (I followed the old scoring system).\n\nThen, I decided that the deck can get even stronger. Dunhere is nice, but not very competitive, ceratinly not on par with Eowyn and Denethor. So, I bought Conflict at the Carrock, mainly for Frodo. I ditched Dunhere for Frodo and played all the scenarios at my disposal at that time, save the Dol Guldur one. Won each and every time, save the first time vs the Carrock where I made a terrible mistake and was extremely unlucky at the exact same time. Then, in a flash of insight, I thought that two top-notch defenders (Frodo and Denethor) are overkill in a deck with Spirit as a main sphere. And I replaced Denethor with Beravor.\n\nOh, God.\n\nLet me tell you, with that deck I absolutely destroyed and still destroy every scenario I play. Passage? Check. Journey? Check. Hunt? Check? Carrock? Check. I recently bought Khazad-Dum and played the three scenarios with that deck. I raped them. Once each, though I played only once each till now. I 'm considering the Nightmare mode, though, with two Will of the West in my deck, I doubt they 'll provide a greater challenge.\n\nI 've yet to play the Dol Guldur scenario, which almost everyone agrees in nigh on impossible for solo play, so I cannot comment on it yet. But let me tell you this: My Spirit / Lore with a splash of Leadership deck with Eowyn / Frodo / Beravor defeats every time the first two CS scenarios and the Hunt and Carrock AP. Most probably, the Khazad-Dum ones as well. I own only a CS, HfG, CatC and Khazad-Dum.\n\nThe game may range from very difficult to very easy, depending on the deck you make.

Nightmare can be more easy then normal game cose there is some tricks by Beravur to get very good card in your hand between quests. Me and my friend have couple of decks to win all quests already. What next???? There is no challenge anymore........\n\nSo what we do now, we make decks for 2 players game and we use 1 sphere only once.\n\nSo if i use spirit my friends cannot use it. And this is quite cool!!! We still win but is not easy and you really need to use your brain to win.Of course we dont play quest less then difficult 6.\n\nAnd we never use Beravur or Glimly.
