According to him, the piece (and, presumably, the card it will be on) is called \"Revealed in Wrath\", which makes me think that it will be one of our new Noldor themed cards in the new cycle, most likely Spirit or Leadership event. I will also add that this is one of my favorites pieces of art in this game ever, owing to my assertion in the art-themed episode of COTR (I wrote that last email) that the art is only getting better and better.\n\n \n\nApologies to FFG for posting it here in the forums (considering that they have taken down all the pieces of artwork that have \"leaked\" before the its card is released). Just take it as my personal revenge for giving us nothing in the past weeks in terms of previews and releases.\n\n \n\nSo, without further adue, here's the piece in question, and let the speculation begin!\n\n \n\n11350487_651481878287261_359834680101367 [https://scontent-gru1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/11350487_651481878287261_3598346801013677752_n.jpg?oh=8aa1b17be0f58906665318f7c784af92&amp;oe=55F45F9C]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180690-newfound-piece-of-art/?do=findComment&comment=1665299","commentId":1665299,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1434730782,"content":"Well done. Thanks for sharing. For those who might not know (though there may be few), this scene is from the Flight to the Ford chapter. The golden-hair figure is Glorfindel making sure Nazgul step into the flood/trap. Before I read the title of the piece, I thought we might get an ally Glorfindel, which would be superb. Now, of course it is going to be an event. I have no idea what it might do, however. I just hope it will require Noldor unique character to be in play -- just like Elrond's Counsel does.\n\n \n\nThe art is excellent, by the way. Especially the composition.\n\nEdited June 19, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180690-newfound-piece-of-art/?do=findComment&comment=1665300","commentId":1665300,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1434730861,"content":"My thoughts exactly Fingolfin Fate. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180690-newfound-piece-of-art/?do=findComment&comment=1665421","commentId":1665421,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1434736408,"content":"Yeah, Glorfindel, FttF -> Noldor themed card.

Now, speaking of art, I really like Giacobino's depiction of elves as well. I personally don't like that almost all elf art in this game looks either copied from the movies (Elven spear comes to mind), or heavily inspired by them. In the case of the spear, while there's no obvious plagiarism of the movies, it has that, IMO, cliched, tired \"intertwined vines\", slightly curved look to it (I'm looking at the spear itself), not to mention the golden layered armor and blue cloak, straight from the Last Alliance bit from the movies. I will admit though that those designs are effective and look good, but people seem to forget that it wasn't until John Howe made the designs for the movie that those \"intertwined vines\" became the standard design of the Elves in almost all media. Before that, we had other elven designs that looked pretty good (for example, take a look at Rivendell from the Ralph Bakshi animated movie).\n\n \n\nI would love to see some variation , especially from a game that claims to avoid inspiration from the movies (something at which it fails IMO).\n\n \n\nHere's some pics for reference: \n\n \n\nelven-spear.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/94/f4/94f43359-887b-4c64-91dc-39263aa9adaa/elven-spear.png]  \n\n \n\nelrondgilgalad1.jpg [http://lotroplayers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/elrondgilgalad1.jpg]\n\n \n\nGiacobino's design for Glorfindel looks somewhat like this, but hey, at least the sword is straight.\n\nEdited June 19, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180690-newfound-piece-of-art/?do=findComment&comment=1665901","commentId":1665901,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1434776559,"content":"When I saw the Spear, I thought immediately of the movie, too. However, the design for the movies is often so great that it is hard to avoid the influence. Like the Elven shapes resembling leaves or swans or organic shapes in general: so very well designed and crafted.\n\n \n\nAfter all, in one way or another, everything we do is based on something we have already observed (save instincts maybe)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180690-newfound-piece-of-art/?do=findComment&comment=1666052","commentId":1666052,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1434804406,"content":"Great find, thanks for posting. Super excited about what's in store for the Noldor. Can't guess what this particular card is going to do. Love the artwork - love Glorfindel, but the image is fantastic regardless! Currently reading about the Nirnaeth Arnoediad and siege of Gondolin in the Sil; I know Spirfindel often gets frowned at for being overpowered and a boring go-to option for Secrecy decks, but I've always played him for the theme and nothing else. Again, really happy Noldor are getting some attention."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180690-newfound-piece-of-art/?do=findComment&comment=1666212","commentId":1666212,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1434817707,"content":"> After all, in one way or another, everything we do is based on something we have already observed (save instincts maybe).\n\n \n\nYou're absolutely right about that, it's just that I wish they didn't rely so much on the movies to make the art.\n\n \n\nSpeaking of Glorfindel, I also really like him, even if he's not very interesting mechanically. He's still a great character and I'm glad that they made this \"mistake\" with him and not some obscure and random character (though I guess they stlll did with Hirluin), considering he's one of the most powerful elves in Middle Earth. I hope the new Noldor cards, and especially this event, will breathe new life into him.\n\nEdited June 20, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180690-newfound-piece-of-art/?do=findComment&comment=1666233","commentId":1666233,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1434819813,"content":"Yes, that is my point always when I justify Spirit Glorfindel to others. He was one of the mightiest (if not the mightiest) of the time, so that should be represented by the card. One way to do it is to give very high attributes and very high threat, like they did with Gandalf; the other way is this, I guess. I dislike when the power creeps somewhere a reader of the book could never guess it: like Hirluin indeed. Or the Outlands themselves, you never get that idea from the book that the Outlands get super powerful once they come together. They were (in a sense) lesser people to Gondorian, the heirs of Númenor; and the game does not portray that in the least.\n\n \n\nBack to Noldor. I really hope their ways are wicked. I am glad with what they did with Erestor but I hope there is more (variety) in store. And especially in the store soon."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180690-newfound-piece-of-art/?do=findComment&comment=1668081","commentId":1668081,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1434991847,"content":"Heh, I suppose since Glorfindel has gotten shafted in every single LOTR adaptation, it's about time he got to hog the attention!"}]}
