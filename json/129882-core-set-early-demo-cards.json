The design is different in some details, and Aragorn's abilty has been nerfed quite a bit. Not sure if y'all know about these, just in case you don't I will link them here.\n\n \n\nGo on this German site :\n\n \n\nhttp://www.heidelbaer.de/dyn/products/detail?ArtNr=HE339 [http://www.heidelbaer.de/dyn/products/detail?ArtNr=HE339]\n\n \n\nand click these pics HE339_hdr_lcg_demo_essen.jpg [http://www.heidelbaer.de/productimages/small/HE339_hdr_lcg_demo_essen.jpg] next to the core set box.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129882-core-set-early-demo-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1380978","commentId":1380978,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1419507723,"content":"Didn't seen that Theodred and Dunhere yet.

Willpower at the bottem, while it is now at the top. Theodred would have been a great hero against the Dunland scenarios! Having an ability the control your handsize is great. Also that treachery card that stays in your hand, I think that could be discarded. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited December 25, 2014 by gandalfDK"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129882-core-set-early-demo-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1380986","commentId":1380986,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1419509661,"content":"You mean Theodred?

(He initiates the attack, and then gets assistance on his valid target) but he does lose +1 attack.\n\n \n\nI think the Theodred is definitely worse, he's better at questing sure - but having to discard a card for the resource is a lot worse than getting it free for questing. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129882-core-set-early-demo-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1381038","commentId":1381038,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1419514009,"content":"Well, that thing about Theodred is arguable at best. First of all, his WP is still 1 so I can't see how he is better at questing. Second, his ability is limited to 1 per phase. Paired with, say, Bilbo and Beravor, he could produce helluva resources on the first turn, setting up a perfect second turn in a multiplayer game. Well, technically, he could do the same even without them, it's just without them his player would have nothing to play for himself :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nEdited December 25, 2014 by MyNeighbourTrololo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129882-core-set-early-demo-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1381093","commentId":1381093,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1419521396,"content":"Appears that traits such as Rohan and Dunedain were icons on the lower right corner of the card.
