You said there were other ways to heal Wilyador and I was trying to say that there aren't many other ways to do that. Not in a million years would I dismiss Lore of Imladris.\n\nBasically there are 3 ways to heal him outside of Athelas.\n\nRadagast for 1 - 5 HP(which takes a long time to accumulate and could be awhile before you will be able to play him).\nLore of Imladris for 5 HP when Rhosgobal is out of the staging area.\nGlorfindel for 1 HP and you'll lose him for the game.\n\nAt least with Radagast, it's possible to play him again after he is taken out of the game the first time, but it would take awhile before he has resources to use to heal Wilyador once.\n\nThis is why it's a 6 difficulty. You need to be tremendously lucky to draw enough Athelas or ways to heal Wilyador. Your biggest enemy in this quest is time.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61879-journey-to-rhosgobel/?do=findComment&comment=606057","commentId":606057,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1331819732,"content":"ahhh  my apologies Bomb, i am sometimes pretty teribble at getting peoples points on here"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61879-journey-to-rhosgobel/?do=findComment&comment=606095","commentId":606095,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1331824249,"content":" Tackling Rhosgobel is tough...the best way to go about (IMO) this is not only to think about healing, but also to make sure you can cancel the nasty damaging effects on Treachery cards in the deck. I have never tried to solo it, but in a two players coop game I ran Spirit+Tactics, and my gf ran Lore+Leadership. I used Eleanor to get rid as much as possible of the big Treachery cards, along with Tests of Will, and she made sure there was plenty of healing.\n\nGranted though, I was lucky...I landed Rhadagast early in the game and piled up on ressources for our final push. Also had a Dwarven tomb and a Test of Will so I knew I could at least use it twice. SO yeah...needs luck, but my point is it also needs Treachery control.
