Close to guaranteed ready every round in 4 player.\n\nBear suggests they will be developing the idea of shuffling Beornings into your deck. Ally Beorn from the core set does the same thing. Our developer loves to revisit old ideas and make them relevant when building up an archetype out of an old trait.\n\nSo... maybe we will see a card which lets you search the top X cards of your deck for a Beorning ally and play it at some cost?  We are going to get that effect with the upcoming skin changer ally, except it interacts with your discard pile. Perhaps we could see a similar card interacting with your deck. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285666-fire-in-the-night-two-more-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3524414","commentId":3524414,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1541423187,"content":"The bear is really good if considered in combo with the skinchanger or any other form of ally cheating like the offsphere elf-stone or a very good tale or red arrow.

Nonesense. Even without any ability at all it would definetely be better than Treebeard, quikbeam, gildor, any of the haradrim, hobbit Gandalf  or arwen which are typically regarded among the best allies on the game.\n\nAnd devoting deckspace for the skinchanger to bring the bear (or beorn ally) in is just a way to limit its power and the kind of deck that can run it.\n\nIt seem a sort of limited form of resource generation which is an offsphere ability for tactic.
