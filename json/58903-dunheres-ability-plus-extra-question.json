Since it doesn't, the only time you could attack would be during the combat phase. \n\n(answers) The answers for the other two questions are both \"yes.\" Yes, you can use Sneak Attack with Gandalf, and it becomes really useful in more difficult scenarios. Yes, you can play attachments on any character as long as you don't break the prerequisites. For example, some say play on a hero only. If it doesn't have a sphere restriction, you can attach your Leadership card to Legolas."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58903-dunheres-ability-plus-extra-question/?do=findComment&comment=579016","commentId":579016,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1326459072,"content":"@Budgernaut\n\nHmm, your opinion is actually a very good way of explaining why he can only attack during the Combat Phase. \n\n \n\nThank you both, Budgernaut and richsabre for your quick answers! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOne last thing:\n\nThe location Old Forest Road says that you ready a character after you TRAVEL there.

It does NOT dictate WHERE you can play those cards. Essentially, what this is saying is that you need a hero of the matching sphere to play the card, but when it comes to attachments you can play it on any eligible character in play. Unless the card specifies on what you can play it, you can play it on any character."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58903-dunheres-ability-plus-extra-question/?do=findComment&comment=580238","commentId":580238,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1326718095,"content":"well crap (again).
