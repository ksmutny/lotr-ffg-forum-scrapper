I'm considering not playing Will of the West anymore. In solo mode, at least, you often reach a point where you stop using miner's ability anyway, and the rest of your deck should be enough to tackle the quest.\n\nMultiplayer is a different story, as there's always more stuff to do with extra resources (giving them to a partner via Parting Gifts) and Will of the West can also be used on another player, if needed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64839-ziggy-miner-do-you-ever-run-out-of-cards/?do=findComment&comment=633740","commentId":633740,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1337579379,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nNot if you play with will of the west and dwarven tomb!\n\n\n\n./end of thread"}]}
