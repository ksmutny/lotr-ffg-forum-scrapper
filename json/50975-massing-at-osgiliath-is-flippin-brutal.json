at the event got a free copy of the encounter deck/quest cards.\n\nAs it's PoD and different cardstock, it doesn't use any cards from the base game or adventure packs, only the cards it comes with.\n\nThe three enemies you start with are pretty rough.  My copy's packed away at the moment, but off of memory one has only 1 attack, 0 defense, and 2 health, but all copies of him engage the player with the lowest threat at the start of the encounter step.  Which is nasty with core decks, as the lowest threat is the spirit player (which is the deck with almost no combat ability).  The second card has 3 attack, don't remember health/armor, but if he kills someone he gets shuffled back into the encounter deck.  The last card, the only bit I remember about him is that when he deals damage to one of your characters, you increase your threat by that much as well (I'm pretty sure that's what he does, at least; can't remember for sure).  Total of 16 threat in the staging area with 4 players at setup.  There's also a card that increases the threat by 1 for each Scout enemy in the staging area (all the starting enemies are Scouts), which is how my group got a turn-1 loss (two of those cards in a row meant even the Spirit player hit 50 threat).\n\nThere is one good thing, one of the cards in the encounter deck is an ally.  If he shows up as the normal encounter card, he goes to the first player, but gains Surge so you draw another card.  If he's a shadow card, he does 2 damage to the enemy and the defender can exhaust a character to keep him as an ally.  Despite the boost, the quest is incredibly hard, and you'll need either good constructed decks or ungodly lucky draws to beat it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50975-massing-at-osgiliath-is-flippin-brutal/?do=findComment&comment=511600","commentId":511600,"userName":"Mighty Jim
