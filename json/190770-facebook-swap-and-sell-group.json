Since it's a solo game players are are more apt to just hold onto the cards for years (decades?) even if they are not actively playing. There is no meta or local player base to keep up with.  Once in a while I'll see someone on the forums or Ebay selling a collection, but it is very rare."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190770-facebook-swap-and-sell-group/?do=findComment&comment=1842199","commentId":1842199,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1444420478,"content":"Also, there is a sales section on cardgamedb that you may want to take a look at.\n\nBoardgamegeek also has some sales sections."}]}
