It's the first episode, so it's a tad longer (about 6mins longer), but i'm aiming for quick and informative 15min videos about some lesser used cards in the game. I know the video is not perfect, but hoping you guys can get something out of it and like the idea for the series!\n\nIn the series we'll take some lesser (or maybe not) used cards, talk about their place in the cardpool, break down a deck i've constructed featuring a card, and finally get it a spin in a quest and give the verdict! \n\nIn the first episode i've decided to cover Last Stand, an event i've never seen played, and we'll see if it's actually pretty good, or does it have a good reason to stay in the binders! Please give me your feedback if you want to see more and better videos!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306492-how-good-is-a-new-youtube-series/?do=findComment&comment=3906445","commentId":3906445,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1583244491,"content":"You have my sword!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306492-how-good-is-a-new-youtube-series/?do=findComment&comment=3906599","commentId":3906599,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1583259836,"content":"Awesome!

Bilbo's Plan on the other hand seems too convoluted and possibly negative as an effect. Smoke and Think could be a really good card making Pipe decks kinda viable since getting to 2-3 pipes is not so hard especially with the new Spare Pipe going on any character (and searching for an event to get Smoke and Think even faster)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306492-how-good-is-a-new-youtube-series/?do=findComment&comment=3939638","commentId":3939638,"userName":"Felswrath","timestamp":1589494077,"content":"The Red Book is insane!
