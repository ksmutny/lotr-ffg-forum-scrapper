Much like Amazon, postage has been hit and miss thus far.\n\nLong story short - I think postage and availability will fluctuate, so I don't think you can lose with either direct from FFG or locally (Mil sims). I wouldn't bother with Amazon, the prices aren't that much of a saving and they tend to mail out a bit later than the local guys and of course they are always mailing out later than FFG direct.\n\nWhilst I have had a peek at local retailers here in SA - I find local retail shops are always charging a good $10 above what I can get things from via postage.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n "}]}
