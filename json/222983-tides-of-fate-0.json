If you allowed that, there's some pathological stuff you could start to argue for. Look at Harbor Master:\n\n \n\n\"Response: After a card effect adds any number of resources to the resource pool of a hero you control, Harbor Master gains +1 Defense until the end of the round.\"\n\n \n\nSo, some arbitrary card effect fires, and...\n\n \n\nMr. Pathology: ...all right, Harbor Master now has +3 Defense until the end of round.\n\nGame: ...huh?\n\nMr. Pathology: That card effect added 0 resources to each of my 3 heroes, so I use Harbor Master's Response thrice. +3 Defense.\n\nGame: GTFO.\n\n \n\nNeedless to say, I don't think this would be allowed.\n\n \n\nEDIT: Okay, so the FAQ on adding resources explicitly disallows this example. How about Boromir ally? \"Well, he took 0 damage, and 'any' includes 0, so he readies, right?\"\n\nEdited June 19, 2016 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222983-tides-of-fate-0/?do=findComment&comment=2273795","commentId":2273795,"userName":"awp832","timestamp":1466370225,"content":" there is a huge difference between these scenarios.   \n\nIf there was a card effect that specifically added 0 resources, you might have a good case for being able to trigger harbor master.   \n\n\"Made-Up Card:\nReady a hero, then add 0 resources to the resource pools of up to 3 heros you control.\"\n\nif the text was something like that,  then the scenario would be comparable."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222983-tides-of-fate-0/?do=findComment&comment=2273797","commentId":2273797,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1466370227,"content":"My guess is that 0 is excluded from \"any X\" calculations. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222983-tides-of-fate-0/?do=findComment&comment=2273808","commentId":2273808,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1466370849,"content":"You could select 0 for X in We Are Not Idle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222983-tides-of-fate-0/?do=findComment&comment=2274029","commentId":2274029,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1466388749,"content":"I think the key word is \"increase\" and not \"any.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222983-tides-of-fate-0/?do=findComment&comment=2274198","commentId":2274198,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1466409160,"content":"> Is it legal to play Tides of Fate after an enemy shadow card gives an enemy +0 attack?  -for example, the \"Many Roads\" as a shadow effect (Shelob's Lair quest) when there is no active location.\n> \n>  \n\nNo\n\n \n\nThe card specifies that it must increase the attack by any amount but 0 is not an amount.
