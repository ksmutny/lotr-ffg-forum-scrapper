He reckons that if you block a monster and then the card is destroyed teh block is still counted as defended.. while I think this is incorrect….\n\nExample…\n\nSleeping Sentry\n\n * Shadow: Defending player must discard all exhausted characters he controls.\n\nor\n\n Pathless Country\n\n * Shadow: Deal 1 damage to each ally in play\n\nThere are many other cards that can kill allies and heroes b4 the block happens… anyway, if these shadow effects kill the defender say a 4attack warg,,, then the attack is in fact undefended and the 4 dmg has to go on the hero… as the attack is now undefended.. correct?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67755-do-you-guys-play-destroyed-allies-still-block/?do=findComment&comment=661059","commentId":661059,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1342711206,"content":"Yes you right no defender on resolve attack is undefended."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67755-do-you-guys-play-destroyed-allies-still-block/?do=findComment&comment=661068","commentId":661068,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1342712176,"content":" Sounds like your friend is a M:tG player.  But yeah, Glaurung is right."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67755-do-you-guys-play-destroyed-allies-still-block/?do=findComment&comment=661070","commentId":661070,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1342712370,"content":"booored said:\n\nif these shadow effects kill the defender say a 4attack warg,,, then the attack is in fact undefended and the 4 dmg has to go on the hero… as the attack is now undefended.. correct?\n\n\n\nCorrect. If your partner doesn't believe it, cite p. 18 of the rules:\n\nIf a defending character leaves play or is removed from combat before damage is assigned, the attack is considered undefended."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67755-do-you-guys-play-destroyed-allies-still-block/?do=findComment&comment=661076","commentId":661076,"userName":"Shiv@n","timestamp":1342713050,"content":"the determination of defenders and the defense itself are two different phases."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67755-do-you-guys-play-destroyed-allies-still-block/?do=findComment&comment=661245","commentId":661245,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1342751659,"content":"yeah, I knew it.. it is just after a while he had me confused … lol…"}]}
