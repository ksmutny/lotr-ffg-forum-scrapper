The first quest stage states that enemies get +2 defense and can't be engaged, and to skip the encounter phase. Does that mean that I can't use card effects to engage enemies? Things like Knight of Minas Tirith or Hammer Stroke have no effect? What about the location that states I must engage an enemy to travel there? Can I engage through that card effect, or can I not travel to that location during the first quest stage? This quest had been kicking my butt, and I want to make sure I'm not making things way harder on myself. Thanks all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127470-question-about-breaking-of-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1340489","commentId":1340489,"userName":"Spurries","timestamp":1416452967,"content":"Any engagement in the first stage is not allowed. Basically power quest through the first stage and go from there. I'm not really sure the significance of skipping the encounter phase but I'm sure there is one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127470-question-about-breaking-of-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1340494","commentId":1340494,"userName":"jeffnorth86","timestamp":1416453660,"content":"Ok that's what I thought. I've been having some trouble getting through this in my campaign... Can't seem to get through that first stage."}]}
