We all know that the next Expansion is going to be Hobbit Saga and with it comes 5 heroes (1 for each sphere + Bilbo). Currently we have 7 Tactics heroes and 6 heroes in Spirit, Leadership and Lore. I for one would not be surprised to see FFG replace 1 set of player cards with 3 heroes. Meaning that Shadow and Flame AP would contain heroes for Leadership, Lore and Spirit. Giving us a total of 7 heroes for each sphere.\n\nFFG has thrown plenty of curve balls throughout this cycle when it came to the heroes they released ie. a 2nd copy of Aragorn and Glorfindel, putting out a 2nd tactics hero before giving us a spirit hero. (Plus for those of you that play AGoT LCG we just recieved 3 plot cards in the same pack instead just the normal one.) Nothing is set in stone to say the least.\n\nNow this is all speculation and I won't count on seeing 3 heroes in SaF but I just have this feeling FFG has one more curve ball to send our way in the Dwarrowdelf cycle. As for the hero (or heroes) that will show up, who knows? I thought it was going to be Glorfindel in the last AP and surpise surpise he skipped head to FoS."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65919-shadow-and-flame-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=643880","commentId":643880,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1339567840,"content":"interesting idea- this is my first lcg so ive no idea how likely ffg is to do something like this…………being honest id rather have the 3 player cards, some really decent ones though, it would just feel a little strange getting 3 heros in one pack\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65919-shadow-and-flame-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=643884","commentId":643884,"userName":"Sprenger","timestamp":1339568247,"content":"Im under the impression we will be fighting a Balrog so we could use all the help we can get! haha.
