They are perfect for testing player decks because you can craft the encounter deck exactly how you want. You can just build an encounter deck that sounds fun to you to intentionally wreck yourself or create really thematic decks centered around Wargs, Orcs, threat raising, direct damage, etc.\n\nDon't feel too bad about missing Assault on Dol Guldur!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286127-wizards-quest-and-woodland-realm-announced-for-retail/?do=findComment&comment=3534823","commentId":3534823,"userName":"ColinEdwards","timestamp":1542153691,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> Don't﻿ feel too bad about missing Assault on Dol Guldur﻿!\n\nWe have gotten a lot of replay out of AoDG by mixing the cards into Woodlands Realms; I love the boss fights.

In which case I would say the only reason to do so is if you want to play competitively with a friend who does not own the quest.\n\nBut if you only want to play cooperatively with the quick build rules, I'm not sure you could even legally use a second quest. Doubling up on a single encounter set could produce greater-than-three copies of a single encounter card, something which is disallowed in advanced builds.\n\nThe advanced rules are pretty fun, though, and they're much more fun with a second copy of the cards so you can go 2x of some nasties like Goblin Sniper."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286127-wizards-quest-and-woodland-realm-announced-for-retail/?do=findComment&comment=3535061","commentId":3535061,"userName":"ColinEdwards","timestamp":1542178917,"content":"> 4 hours ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> So you add cards from other encounter sets to the Woodland Realm/Wizard's Quest? :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]\n\nYeah, exactly.
