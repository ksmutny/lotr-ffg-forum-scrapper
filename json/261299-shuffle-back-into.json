Riffle shuffle mean that you take half of your deck and insert it on the other half. To get to a really clean situation 12 riffle seem needed. I was rarely courageous enough but doing 6 of it make a big effect;\n\n2- Since this technic, in some conditions, an ability to know exactly where cards are (if cards are ABCDEFGH at the beginning they were AEBFCGDH after first riffle, then ACEGBDFH, then ABCDEFGH.. see the problem? ^^) it can be considered not to be real shuffle. I was doing some regular shuffle (overhand shuffle) to break the series every two riffle when I was playing Magic tournament and I keep that use since it break the problem that can occur with riffle shuffle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/261299-shuffle-back-into/?do=findComment&comment=3039189","commentId":3039189,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1508684112,"content":"> On 10/20/2017 at 7:57 PM, Rouxxor said:\n> \n> When I try to know how to shuffle properly here is the feedback I got:\n> \n> 1- Riffle shuffle is king of the shuffle. Riffle shuffle mean that you take half of your deck and insert it on the other half. To get to a really clean situation 12 riffle seem needed. I was rarely courageous enough but doing 6 of it make a big effect;\n\nThese numbers are somewhat overkill, I think.\n\nThe classic mathematical result is that 7 riffle shuffles of a traditional deck of cards is \"good enough\", but even that is overkill for LotR, since not only are our player/encounter decks usually fewer than 52 cards, but also there are many duplicates. Persi Diaconis helped update his original heuristic for this problem here:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/0905.4698 [https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.4698]\n\nIn particular, the # of shuffles required to lose the position of a single card in a deck, if you are already ignorant of all the other cards' positions (a common situation in all card games), is usually quite low.\n\nPersonally, I tend to riffle shuffle things 4-5 times in LotR."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/261299-shuffle-back-into/?do=findComment&comment=3039211","commentId":3039211,"userName":"Moradir","timestamp":1508686040,"content":"And be carefull that the Eagles don't fly away when riffle shuffling ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png].
