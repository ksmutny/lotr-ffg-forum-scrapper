The subtle difference between this response and, say, leadership frodo, is that the triggering event is the engaging the enemy, not the readying. There is also no \"then\" to imply an order of events (i.e. engage enemy, ready, then apply boost). \n\nIt also helps then to engage more than one enemy with higher threat through card effect, as he can ready once and get a +2 or more boost."}]}
