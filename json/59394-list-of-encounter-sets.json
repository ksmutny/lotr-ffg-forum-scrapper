Is there a list somewhere of all of the released quests and which encounter sets they use? I am looking at purchasing individual encounter sets (here: www.toywiz.com/lotrlcgcorespidersofmirkwood.html [http://www.toywiz.com/lotrlcgcorespidersofmirkwood.html]) so I can have all my quests permanently put together, but I need a list before I purchase them.\n\nIf this doesn't exist, maybe I'll try and put one together this evening. It would be nice to have a checklist."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59394-list-of-encounter-sets/?do=findComment&comment=583555","commentId":583555,"userName":"Lohgrim","timestamp":1327317466,"content":"Â That's not a bad idea.
