For example, when a player uses A Test of Will to cancel the ‘when revealed’ effects of The Necromancer’s Reach, the players do not deal 1 damage to each character in play and then remove 1 damage from each character in play. Instead, no damage is dealt.\n> Similarly, if you use the Response effect on Raven-winged Helm to cancel the damage just dealt to Erkenbrand after triggering his Response effect, you do not place 1 damage on Erkenbrand and then remove it. Instead, the damage is not dealt at all. In which case, his cost has not been paid and you cannot resolve his effect.\n> Visually, it looks like this:\n> Damage is dealt by effect ——> Response effect cancels damage dealt ——> No damage is actually dealt\n> Cheers,\n> Caleb\n> \n>  \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181692-erkenbrand-and-damage-cancellation-official-response/?do=findComment&comment=1679404","commentId":1679404,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1435864632,"content":"I'm a little confused.

That means the damage still activates (for lack of a better word) but doesn't resolve. That's why you can still only activate Treebeard's ability 5 times, even if it never resolves once."}]}
