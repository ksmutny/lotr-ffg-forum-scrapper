Boromir is my favourite in the book but some of his adaptation actually makes the character even more rich, and I really liked the extended scene in the Two Towers where you get to see the brothers together, that was special which you did not get in the books.\n\nAnd ever since the films went out I was thinking you know one day they can make maybe six movies or a series, and then when the tv hit the golden era, I really started thinking, and then the Amazon announcement came. But I am super happy they do the Second Age. However, if they do that right, they can then do the Third Age, you know Angmar and the second rising of Sauron, and perhaps the whole War of the Ring, including the Battles in the North. It could be grand, the five seasons just a start if things go right but I can see fourteen or twenty with all of this material before we ever get to the Silmarillion.\n\nEdited March 27, 2019 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292774-happy-tolkien-reading-day/?do=findComment&comment=3661246","commentId":3661246,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1553817519,"content":"> On 3/27/2019 at 1:53 AM, TheSpitfired said:\n> \n> Don't get me started.

That was for me the worst writing in the whole trilogy. I really like him in the books, but in the movies he is just a bad guy.\n\nI do not see that at all with Faramir. He has got his loyalty, he still breaks in in the end to help the Quest, even though he is tempted by the Ring, so he wins a double moral victory there, as I see it.

And I like the Faramir version in the book. He is not my favourite but I like him. He is not my favourite in the movies but his plot does not bother me. As for the orders, I think Denethor’s knowledge about ‘mighty weapon’ or whichever way he puts it is something extra in the movies, I believe. Basically, the movies throw a better light on Boromir (though his redemption happens in the books) and a much, much worse light on Denethor, which I find a shame. I really like those passages in the book v with him and Faramir and Gandalf. He is still cruel but not mad. He only turns mad after looking into the Palantír when he loses all hope; but until then he tries to do his job, not ruin Gondor.\n\nEdited March 31, 2019 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292774-happy-tolkien-reading-day/?do=findComment&comment=3663631","commentId":3663631,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1554016830,"content":"> 16 hours ago, Vince79 said:\n> \n> I agree that Viggo came off better as Strider than as the Heir.  Probably my favorite scene of his was when he addressed the Dead in Dunharrow, he was owning his heritage there.  And at the end of Return of the King, when told the hobbits \"My friends, you bow to no one\".  But that aside, I don't know if I should blame him or the writing.  I remember him saying he had never read the LOTR before the job came up, so I don't know if he really had a good feel for the character.  Or maybe it was just the writing, I don't know.\n\nFunny you give these examples, I too find them his best of the latter movies. Also after the Dead Men refuse as Aragorn looks at the Corsair ships, his failing hope is very convincing. In a similar way he is very good with both Boromir and Haldir passing away. And though Jackson usually does a very good job with actors, I do not think he got the best out of Viggo. Sean Bean had much less screen time to play with and he achieved much more for Boromir’s character. So did the likes of Ian Holm but that could have been expected of such an accomplished actor.\n\nEdited March 31, 2019 by lleimmoen"}]}
