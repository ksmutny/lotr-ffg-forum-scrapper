That's the only one I can think of (Elrond enables you to play Lembas anyway), but there could theoretically be more in the future."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2808224","commentId":2808224,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1495832382,"content":"Won my second attempt.  Did a bit of turtling on 1A and was lucky to be able to keep recurring an easy location with Off Track.  I also had a couple of side quests come up which further enabled the strategy.  Both decks treated me pretty well.  Brood Mother is a tough kill."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2809203","commentId":2809203,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1495918169,"content":"This might be the first quest where I've really wanted to put side quests into my stack.
