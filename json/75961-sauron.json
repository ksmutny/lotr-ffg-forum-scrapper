So after Isildur cutted his finger he became an eye or di he assumed a poor human form? I ask beacuse i have seen debates wether if the eye was a metaphor and also the line that says Gollum that Sauron had four fingers makes me wonder if he assumed a human body?

After Elendil and Gil-galad defeated Sauron and Isildur took the Ring, Sauron's spirit fled the scene. Centuries later he began to rebuild his former strength in Dol Guldur and then returned to Mordor in physical form. The Eye represents Sauron's \"thought\" peering here and there in Middle-earth, though there is something physical about because when Frodo sees Barad Dur he seems some kind of orange eye (the exact words eacape me).\n\nThings get muddled in the movie because Gandalf says something about him not being able to take physical form, and because the Eye is everywhere. The four finger line is evidence enough, but even practically speaking, how would a spirit put on a Ring?\n\nThere are far better explanations out there, citing some of Tolkien's essays on how spirit beings operate in his world, but hopefully that gets you started. It's all I can do right now, typing on the iPad :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nedit: The quote is in the Mt. Doom chapter, and Frodo sees \"a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing Eye\". I reckon this is the line that Peter Jackson ran with when creating the Eye of the movies. Is it an actual eye, or representative of Sauron's power, or did Frodo alone see it because he was the Ringbearer (he says earlier that he sees a ring of fire with his waking eyes)? Anyways. Some food for thought, but the link below quotes Tolkien as confirming Sauron's bodily form so there is little to debate."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75961-sauron/?do=findComment&comment=737173","commentId":737173,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1356034350,"content":"Here you are…\n\nhttp://www.glyphweb.com/arda/faq/sauronshape.html [http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/faq/sauronshape.html]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75961-sauron/?do=findComment&comment=737212","commentId":737212,"userName":"flightmaster101","timestamp":1356040095,"content":"That gives me an idea for a card:\n\n \n\nSauron\n\nEngagement cost: 1\n\nthreat x\n\nAtt x\n\nDef x \n\nhp x\n\nx is the number of people on earth.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75961-sauron/?do=findComment&comment=737309","commentId":737309,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1356068152,"content":"yes- as shipwreck points out, its a metaphor that has unfortunatly stuck. if you look at an encounter card from HoN you will see the eye peeking through from the tower….i think its on the last quest.\n\nedit- completely forgot about the eye on the back of the cards…..duh…\n\ni had a forum thread going about it here [http://www.lotrplaza.com/showthread.php?22819-why-does-no-one-get-the-eye-metaphor]\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75961-sauron/?do=findComment&comment=737325","commentId":737325,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1356072131,"content":"Short version, Sauron definitely had a physical shape.\n\n \n\nI haven't read the source materials for a while, but I am very positive that there is no evidence there is a gigantic burning eyeball on top of Barad-Dur.\n\n \n\nThis is just my guess, but Sauron probably used Ithil Stone to gather informations that people/orcs thought he didn't know, used that said information to hand out few punishments, declared he is all-knowing and all-seeing and nothing is hidden from him, put Red Eye everywhere to remind his subjects that he will be 'watching' their every move (like how Gondorians use White Tree to remind themselves they are heirs of Numenor).\n\nAfter all, Sauron did few other tricks to make sure Easterlings and Haradhrims worship him as god (like burning his entire body to show that fire has no effect on him.)

Could be, but then why does Frodo see only one eye? And would not it be extremely far away and small for him to be able to see it (besides Sauron having to be, like, leaning over the edge of the tower so the eye is not inside the tower). It sounds strange IMO.

I really enjoyed the LotR Trilogy movies and The Hobbit movie that have just came out. I do sometimes complain about few minor details Peter Jackson has changed, but that is because I am a fan, not an anti-fan."}]}
