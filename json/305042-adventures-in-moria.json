This looks great, not only do we get the answer of when the first pack was being released but we get news of the second at the same time. For those that already have the first do you know if it's compatible with the Mirkwood build your own scenerios that came out before?Â \n\nIt seems like they are going to be making these packs for all of their cycles, something I am totally down with and would love to see some reimagined cards from the realms each cycle created (also mostly Dream-Chaser so FFG you guys can skip ahead if you want a bit haha).\n\nAnyhow it's not the final two packs but it is something and gives me hope for more content as we await Spirit Aragorn and news of what comes next at the end of the year.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305042-adventures-in-moria/?do=findComment&comment=3880246","commentId":3880246,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1580157405,"content":"I believe the encounter sets would be compatible with the Mirkwood sets.
