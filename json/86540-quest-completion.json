When do I consider the quest completed? Immediately or only after I have all of the location tokens.\n\n \n\nThanks\n\nPhil"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86540-quest-completion/?do=findComment&comment=816206","commentId":816206,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1374084840,"content":"the locations do not have to be completed to complete a quest stage or even a whole quest (unless it says otherwise of course)\n\nas soon as the troll dies you go onto 2b\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86540-quest-completion/?do=findComment&comment=816224","commentId":816224,"userName":"Phil43","timestamp":1374086267,"content":"Great thanks.\n\nStill didn't quite manage to get through though!\n\n \n\nGoing to try a Tactics/Spirit deck for a change next.\n\n \n\nPhil"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86540-quest-completion/?do=findComment&comment=816473","commentId":816473,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1374112740,"content":"Official (Retarded version)\n\nQuest cards instantly resolved as soon as there requirements are met, quest counters and any text qualifiers.. (like killing Shelob Spawn for example). This means that you can finish your quest with a ton of monsters out or unexplored locations. This is not only ugly, but thematically wrong.\n\n \n\nLimit the Encounter Deck Fix\n\nOne way many people get around this is to stop drawing from the encounter deck after the end game requirements are met. Then play until the staging area, location area and the combat zone is clear. Others like to reduce the encounter deck draw, so the game is still in motion. I like this better. So in a 2 player game you reduce to 1 draw, in a 3 player 2 draws etc. This way the quest feels completed and that you have finished.\n\n \n\nTry it.. looking at a clear table is so much more satisfying than doing a cowards will run to the end of the quest leaving all the threat you were to lame a player and deck building to deal with. One always leaves you thinking you somehow cheated.. a clear table feels like you have beaten the quest and answered all threats."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86540-quest-completion/?do=findComment&comment=816494","commentId":816494,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1374115411,"content":"That's the first I've ever heard that.   By \"many people,\" do you mean \"a person?\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86540-quest-completion/?do=findComment&comment=816498","commentId":816498,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1374115725,"content":"maybe it is just localized to my meta.
