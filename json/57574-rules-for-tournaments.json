To give you some ideas for how you might structure your tournament, you are welcome to read through the threads related to what I've hosted already. Probably the best place to start would be to check out my Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954] thread. From there you can link to the 2 completed Solo Player Tournaments and the 1 active 2 Player Tournament. Also, in my signature you can link to my tournament Ideas Thread and read how this process has developed and notice where it's heading (new announcement made today for next week's new solo player tournament). That said, I hope you'll join in on some of these tournaments as a player, as it's been a lot of fun so far, and the more the merrier. Plus that will give you experience for designing your own. And speaking of that...\n\nIt sounds like you are considering hosting a live tournament (different from hosting one online over the course of a week or month). In that case, you could modify some of the ideas I have used and provide all participants with a list of parameters before the tournament (quest, deck building restrictions, number of players, etc...) and then give everyone the same window of time on a given day (say noon to 4pm, or whatever) to use their pre-built decks to try the tournament quest as many times as they can during the given window, attempting to post their best score.\n\nAnyway, that's just an idea. If you do host your own tournament, I'd love to hear how it goes, what you learn from it, what went well, what didn't. I'd love to learn from your experience as I continue to host tournaments here. Also, did I mention you're invited to play in any of the tournaments I'm hosting here on the forums? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] Because you are. You can even invite your friends to join in too.

As this is co-op vs the rules game, slight mistakes in rule management will greatly bend the outcome of the scores.\n\nIn duel games, it is an excepted practice that players try to \"get in your head\" and trip you up or sneak past rules with out their opponent noticing.. but this is different, as the encounter deck can never speak up and say.. hang on.. you can not sneak attack Gandalf to lower your threat so that just revealed encounter card that came out during the quest phase no longer auto engages and then also use him to attack or block an engaged creature. The Hunt for Gollum deck can not say.. \"hang on.. only the 1st player is allowed to scry the encounter deck after questing in 1b, this is a independent decision and the 3 cards are hidden and not discussed between players.)\n\nWhile Juices events are fun, as is the quest log. I honestly think that the vast majority of scores are invalid due to rule violations. If you wish to run a proper live event there needs to be a ref at each game. On top of honest misplays, if it is a tournament and there is cash on the line, it isn't like a duel game were you check each other.. cheating will happen.\n\nAlso there needs to be some kind of rule to handle missplays. Like for example, because of the table talk rule (Witch also needs to be better defined) if you make a missplay and show a card, you have also violated the table talk rule.. you just can not put that card back in your hand, as now your partner knows you have it.\n\nSo we are thinking that after a missplay that reveals a card or cards, or a table talk violation means that the misplayed cards needs to be discard. You can not shuffle it back into the deck, as shuffling your deck is a powerful effect one that people normal pay resources to do, so this would mean people would misplay on purpose to put dud cards back in and shuffle.. so discard is the only option.\n\nTalking about \"Table Talk\" I think this is on of the best ideas in this game. I love the idea that your partner has to be competent and you need to play as a team but each player is a independent thinker rather than have 1 player basically control the other player. The Table Talk rules as they are are so vauge and loose that they are nearly useless and this needs to be addressed b4 torny play can really start.\n\nIMO, it needs to be way way way way stricter, or completely removed. Though I would prefer for stricter.. Like with the rules as they stand now you can not say card names, but it is meaningless.. like if I say the white wizard you know it is Gandalf. As the rules stand now you can basically tell your partner exactly what is in your hand and what you plan to do.... so the question is.. what is the point of the rule?\n\nIMO, all communication between players about cards that are not in play should be banned, so no alternative names, code names, nick names... etc etc. None of that... Like saying a convo like this should be legal..\n\nP1 - \"Hmm, if I block and it is a bad shadow card though, I might loose my hero.. maybe I should just block with my ally this time?\"\nP2 -\"Narr, do not worry about that shadow card\"\n\nThis is legal as it has no references to cards at all, you are just talking strategy and that is how I think it should be. That unless the card is on the table you can not talk about it in any direct way, including talking about its affect and its name or w/e...\n\nExample of illegal\n\nP1 - \"Look the staging area is already to high threat, we need to quest with everyone and then I can not defend and everyone in staging area will attack me!\"\nP2 - \"yea but I can lower your threat this turn so.. do not worry\"\n\nas you have just told him you have a greeting.. but just saying \"Narr, quest.. lets quest with all\" ... that would be legal.\n\nYou see.. I love the table talk rule.. it add so much .. you have to really trust your partner to know what they are doing and it brings into this game that thing you only get in duel games were awesome game changing events surprise you.. and your just like.. ******* awesome play dude!!\n\nAnyway... imo, the no table talk is a good rule.. but only if it is greatly increased, and defined, as now it is completely pointless. Also if it IS defined, then it also needs to be policed... and again.. for that you need refs at the table."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57574-rules-for-tournaments/?do=findComment&comment=567766","commentId":567766,"userName":"LEGA","timestamp":1323917500,"content":"Agree with booored.\n\nJudges are good idea, but we are all in different part of the world so it's very complicated to judge us).\n\nTable talks... When we started to play we didn't use this rule to understand the game. Then we just forgot about it. When we began to use this rule it became hard no to talk about our cards.\n\nE.g. we have some tournament (international). We play and make a full log (every small step). Then we send result and log to some judgment committee, they'll check it for correctness. So it is possible to discover if the game was correct. But yes, we can't log our table talks.

You can play wherever you want and then post your result(s) here to the forum.\n\nFor your ideas:\n\nHaving players watch each other could work. Sounds kind of tedious (imagining myself playing this way), but if your participants don't mind, it would help mitigate some of the issues boored brought up around ensuring players are being honest. You could have the watching occur every other turn, like you suggested, or have a player watch the entire game of another player and then switch places (maybe not as disruptive to a player's game flow). In general, it could also give an opportunity to bring in the \"getting in another player's head\" piece that boored brought up.\n\nWhy 2 points for a victory and 0 for a loss? Since there is no third option, why not just 1 and 0?\n\nI'm intrigued by the idea of success being based primarily on win/loss, only using the official scoring in case of a tie. That dramatically reduces the value of the scoring and may free people up to use a wider variety of play styles (i.e. turtling). Another option, if you want to value the scoring system more (and maybe you don't - which is also a fine choice) is that you could give 1 point for a win and 2 points for the player who scored the best score overall on that particular adventure (or 2 points and 3 points, if you like the 2 for a victory). That would spice up your scoring (like having 2 and 3 pointers in basketball).  Everyone who got a victory would get 2 points and only one player (per adventure) would get 3 points.  Or it could score more like soccer/football/futbol - 3 points for a win with the best score, 1 point for a win that was not the best score (like a draw in soccer/football/futbol), and 0 points for a loss. Anyway, room to play here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57574-rules-for-tournaments/?do=findComment&comment=567867","commentId":567867,"userName":"Maggical","timestamp":1323942873,"content":"The points are just arbitrary, but I like the idea to award more points to the one with the best score.

Then there are bonus points for the highest scores in victory, but also for the defeat by a lower margin.\n\nThus here we could have a similar system: fixed points for victories, plus/minus bonus depending on the adventure score."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57574-rules-for-tournaments/?do=findComment&comment=567900","commentId":567900,"userName":"Maggical","timestamp":1323947347,"content":"Rugby idea seems good, but can you put that into numbers?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57574-rules-for-tournaments/?do=findComment&comment=567902","commentId":567902,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1323948264,"content":"Maggical said:\n\nRugby idea seems good, but can you put that into numbers?\n\n\n\nI'll think about it, but this is close to what juicebox was describing.\n\nOne way is to make everybody play, giving 1 point per victory (or 2 points, depending on the weight of the victory over bonus points). Then we could look at individual game scores and give bonus points for the 10% best scores within the victorious games and within the defeats.\n\nOne difficulty is to smooth luck in the encounter draws. We know that some encounter deck sequences are deadly when others are easier. This could only be smoothed by playing several times the same scenario, or playing with random, but identical encounter decks for every player (but in that case players should not watch other games, because knowing the encounter deck sequence in advance gives a strong advantage; and this might be dull). Also, giving points for defeats also compensate \"bad\" encounter decks by rewarding players with the best result despite defeat.\n\nJust my 2-pence thoughts. I do not know if such implementation is really fair though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57574-rules-for-tournaments/?do=findComment&comment=567916","commentId":567916,"userName":"Maggical","timestamp":1323950538,"content":"Luck is part of the game, so bad or good draws of the encounter deck are a must in my opinion.

Duel games do this, as a way to round out the luck vs skill. I mean having a single game and getting some super unlucky draw that blows you out is not fun for the players. This is compounded if they have to travel to get to the comp.\n\nI really think the biggest problem for comps at the moment is the table talk rule and its lack of definition. HOw can you have a comp, when there is no consensus of what this rule even is?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57574-rules-for-tournaments/?do=findComment&comment=568166","commentId":568166,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1324007651,"content":" Why not \"simply\" count the wins and use the scores as tie breakers?\n\n \n\nFor example: Out of many competitors player A, B, C and D have risen to the top. A and B have won 5 out of 5 games, while C and D have won 4. But player A and C finished each game with a score of 100, while players B and D finished each game with a score of 200. The final rankings should then look like this (in my opinion):\n\n \n\n1st Player A 5/5 score 500\n\n2nd Player B 5/5 score 1000\n\n3rd Player C 4/5 score 400\n\n4th Player D 4/5 score 800\n\n \n\nSince winning is more important than the score you win with, you don't need to count any score on a lost game.

In my case I'm planning on 6 rounds, all solo playing against all 3 core set adventures and the first 3 adventure packs.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAnother idea to give players some maneuver room will be to have them have their 50 card deck and 12 extra cards that they will be able to switch with ones from their deck to adjust it for different quests, this can be good since it's really difficult to have 1 deck against all adventures. This idea is similar to the idea of sideboard on Magic, although I don't know if it will be good or not...\n\nJavier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57574-rules-for-tournaments/?do=findComment&comment=568263","commentId":568263,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1324033951,"content":"Maggical said:\n\n * 2 extra points to the best score of the round\n * 1 extra point to the second best score of the round\n\n \n\nWhat do you think? \n\n\n\nPersonally I am not a big fan of those.

In order to score a \"win\" against this quest, you need to go 2/3 or 3/3, you take the best score out of the wins, but if you played 2/3 get a small penalty for the lost game.\n\nRight?\n\n \n\nAnd in the end the person with the highest number of \"wins\" wins? With those scores for tie breakers?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57574-rules-for-tournaments/?do=findComment&comment=569612","commentId":569612,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1324357450,"content":"The way we are thinking of running it is a classic \"bracket\" system just like a normal duel game, exactly like in MTG or CoC event.\n\n7189420.jpg [http://www2.picturepush.com/photo/a/7189420/640/7189420.jpg]\n\n \n\nSo think of the \"encounter deck\" as a 2nd player that you are facing. Someone you need to beat in a best of three... this means you need to play 3 games max and win at least 2 of them. Your \"opponents\" in your bracket, have to do the same thing.. the team with the higher score goes into the next round. Just like a normal bracket comp.\n\nSo winning a single round of your best of three, gives a score (from official rules), loosing give no score. You need 2 winning scores to pass the round, and if both teams make it though, then the winner of the bracket is decided by whom has the highest score. Only 1 wining score is counted (obliviously the highest). If you fail the quest, and your opponent wins, you advance the round and scores do not matter. If both teams fail the quest they are both into the looser bracket, (if comp is big enough for a looser bracket) or out of the comp. If both teams pass but for a fluke have the same score, a sudden death round is played, highest score wins.\n\nIt is pretty simple, but I am not sure I see any problems.\n\nThe next bracket is a different quest. All quests are hidden. Like everyone plays the same quest in the same round, but no one knows prior to the round starting what quest they will be playing.\n\nWe are still deciding if you need submitted decks for the entire comp, if you can sideboard and other things.. but we are leaning to a single deck for the entire comp.\n\nI mean this is just work in progress but this is what we are thinking for our comp. I would welcome constructive comments.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57574-rules-for-tournaments/?do=findComment&comment=569616","commentId":569616,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1324358876,"content":"Thank you for explaining that.

Though we are planning to run it as double elimination, with a looser bracket. This allows players to have a good 6 games at absolute minimum.. that is a decent chunk of play time and enough that people will not be upset about getting knocked out \"before they got a chance to see what their deck could do.\n\nWe are also planning to enforce table talk rules.. but we are still a bit divided on exactly what they should be... though we are in agreement that the table talk rules is one of the more interesting and impressive rules in this game that makes it awesome.\n\nplueschi said:\n\n\nI still see some problems though: The KO system doesn't seem to fit well as getting a bye against a certain quest might be pretty big (especially given the probably(?) small number of participants).\n\nAnd the byes are not only limited to the first round since it is possible to only have 3 people enter the semi-finals, if on quarter-final game went lost for both players.\n\nAnd how do you determine the winner, if both players in the final fail the quest?\n\nPersonally I would \"simply\" score the number of wins and not eliminate players from the game, but do it more swiss like.

That is defiantly worth thinking of ... swiss style.. but the problem with swiss is that it is a format to just play and have fun, there are no winners. Each game is seperate event. Like you could as you say tally the scores up and get a overall winner, and I guess that is an option, but we really like the feeling of eliminations comps that as you progress you are meeting up with better players. In swiss you may as well be playing at home and emailing your scores in.\n\nHow about using pretty much the same deal , 3 game / top score per quest / +value to score per lost game. Highest Score wins... tiebreakers on draws. Then instread of a looser and winner bracket like in elimination use a split bracket system to sift the players in groups. So there is no \"elimination\" like before, and everyone gets to play all quest and use their score, but like double elimination you are pushing players that loose a round into a \"separate\" comp they need to fight out of to win. I think this might work best."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57574-rules-for-tournaments/?do=findComment&comment=569988","commentId":569988,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1324432804,"content":"Somehow the idea of an elimination tournament feels wrong for me in a cooperative game. Not only feels it somewhat artificial to have each player run a best of 3 vs the encounter deck, but also bothersome since you essentially play 6 games for one elimination instead of the \"usual\" 3.\n\nIf you want to have elimination, you could make a cut after a certain number of rounds. Like after 3 quests only the top 4/6/8 whatever remain in the competition. And then proceed to some finals from there on.
