How you can hate hobbits????  But actually i also not really big fan of those Hobbits deck in Decipher Lotr TCG. But in this game something switch inside me. I think i want to try build some hobbits deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54134-gollum-arrives-dead-marshes-preview-posted/?do=findComment&comment=536807","commentId":536807,"userName":"Vyron2","timestamp":1317723553,"content":" meccg had some of the coolest things you could do with hobbits! building a deck and destroying the one ring instead of winning the game by marshalling points is just awesome with hobbits...\n\nand in lotr tcg, you could build some decent decks with hobbits...\n\nall in all, if you don't like them, don't play them, but I think they have a very interersting approach to the standard - hack and slay, buffed heroes of middle earth...

Hazard limit of 2, all your creatures are basically useless and if you ever got play a creature, it got cancelled. Only good hobbit is a dead hobbit in my book.\n\nOne of the reasons Middle-Earth Quest rates so highly for me is that there are no hobbits in it. Okay, there is one \"Mad Baggins\" encounter card, but I can live with that."}]}
