(so did you understand when I did use my native tongue? Do I really need to explain why I´m trying to communicate with you in english?)\n\n2) Never said I misspelled it. I said I \"mixed it up\" which is quite more open to interpretation. Misspell could be one way of interpreting it. Swapped could be another.\n\n3) Clearly you have no problems behaving like an ass to people asking for help. Are you surprised people behave like an ass to you? Maybe even trying to deliberately provoke a response to get you to realize that very few people enjoy, in essence, being called stupid?\n\n4) You´re still trying to avoid the core of the conversation here, which is about respecting other people, who´s only fault is asking a question. Are you going to get around to that ever or are you too busy trying to cover your own assinine behaviour?\n\n5) As far as I´m concerned you owe pcjames an apology (don´t know if pcjames is still watching or cares though)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84985-question-about-the-underworld/?do=findComment&comment=803503","commentId":803503,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1371145430,"content":"OK, that was fun but it's time to move on.  I officially declare myself the only person allowed to troll nismojoe for trolling easy questions.  Nothing to see here folks, back to your hobbit holes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84985-question-about-the-underworld/?do=findComment&comment=803660","commentId":803660,"userName":"pcjames","timestamp":1371205507,"content":"eh ,i should clarify that the true intention of asking this question is the word \"one\" confused me in the rule i quoted,it should be a question about language,because english is not my native language,so,anyway,thank you for all guys."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84985-question-about-the-underworld/?do=findComment&comment=803721","commentId":803721,"userName":"nismojoe","timestamp":1371224283,"content":"pcjames said:\n\neh ,i should clarify that the true intention of asking this question is the word \"one\" confused me in the rule i quoted,it should be a question about language,because english is not my native language,so,anyway,thank you for all guys.\n\n\n\n  And now I apologize for my awesome first response.  Had you led off with English isn't your main language, I would not have been so hilarious."}]}
