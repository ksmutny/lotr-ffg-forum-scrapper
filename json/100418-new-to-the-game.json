I am having a go at passage through mirkwood and have put together a 50 card deck (spirit/leadership) I have chosen the characters that I have avaliable with the least amount of threat level (elleanor,theodred and frodo 22 threat) I will attempt to take them through all the quests that I have.\n\njust a couple of questions: can theodred give himself the resource when he quests?\n\nwhat does the X mean in the cost part of some of the cards? (stand and fight)\n\nthanks\n\nregards mic"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100418-new-to-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1000839","commentId":1000839,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1393816637,"content":"Welcome to the game!\n\n \n\nX varies, of course, and in the case of Stand and Fight, the card reads that X is the cost of the ally you wish to target with the effect. So, if you have a cost 4 ally in your discard pile and you wish to put it into play, X = 4. Hope that helps!\n\n \n\nAnd Theodred can give himself moneys :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited March 3, 2014 by shipwreck"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100418-new-to-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1000928","commentId":1000928,"userName":"guest314224","timestamp":1393827130,"content":"cool thanks shipwreck"}]}
