Limiting it to 1 per hero fixes this problem, no need for increasing the cost in my eyes.\n\n \n\n- While I agree that moving him to 2 resources puts him at a higher power rating than most of the new Silvan cards (stat-wise), I also think that his 3 cost makes him weaker than most of the Silvan allies. Since he has no \"enters play\" ability, he likely won't be targeted by the Silvan events, so he'll likely only get the stat boost once. If you compare him to Orophin, who also costs 3 and has ranged, Silverlode archer is losing by 2 stat points. Orophin being unique is a factor here, but Orophin also has an \"enters play\" ability. If he costs 3, I'm not likely going to play Silverlode Archer. If he costs 2, I almost assuredly will.\n\n \n\n- Yea I totally agree that Leadership has a ridiculous advantage with Sneak Attack. It's just that Gandalf has been on the decline lately, and this just shoves him out the door almost completely.\n\n \n\n- I don't really see that as an issue. In 3 or 4 player games where only 1 deck has a decent defender, then I can see that coming up, but in 1 and 2 player games, that's pretty rare. In the instance of a 3 or 4 player game, I kinda view this as a decent strategy that allows each deck to focus on their role better, even if it feels a little cheap; you're still giving yourself a single point of failure, which is a problem in itself. My biggest issue with Unexpected Courage right now is that its cost is low for its ability when compared to other readying abilities. Many other readying effects are 1-time effects and cost 0 or 1. Rohan Warhorse is some strong restrictions, so its cost of 1 seems appropriate. Steed of the Mark costs 1 each time you use it and also has some restrictions. Just to make it comparable to most other readying effects, I'd say making it cost 3 would be fair because you generally get 3 or more uses out of it per game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123002-what-if-core-set-revised/?do=findComment&comment=1278402","commentId":1278402,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1411751821,"content":"Those cards are absolutly amazing, but some of them i would edit:\n\n \n\n-Brok ironfist´s cost should be 5 to make it´s ability more usefull\n\n-Beorn´s hospitalitys art (i myself don´t like it, but it´s just my opinion of this card)\n\n-Gandalf´s search should be 1 (i think it would be too op otherwise)\n\n-Blade of Gondolin should have the old art, i like it more than the new one\n\n-Blade mastery should have cost of 1 instead of 0.\n\n \n\nAnd please do more of these they are so cool :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123002-what-if-core-set-revised/?do=findComment&comment=1278425","commentId":1278425,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1411752721,"content":"joezim007\n\n \n\n-Leadershit is a resource-rich sphere and stuff of that sphere tends to be on the pricier side sometimes.

Sorry, but right now I consider Unexpected Courage as a strong, but not overpowered card to give it such cost.\n\n \n\n- The only reason Silverlode Archer is better than the Silvan card designed for the synergy is because he has 1 more stat point than most of the 2-cost Silvan allies. The reason for that is because those Silvan allies are designed to pop in and out and consistently receive Celeborn's bonus stats. Silverlode Archer is specifically designed to stick around (especially with that cost of 3), so he won't be getting that constant stat boost. The only other 3-cost Leadership ally with such low stats is Son of Arnor, who is largely a dud. His ability is good enough that you want it on a higher-cost character, so I guess instead of lowering his cost to 2, I say throw him another hit point. He's in a small minority of 3-cost allies with only 1 hit point.\n\n \n\n- Even if Steed of the Mark did cost 0, it'd end up having a higher cost than Unexpected Courage most of the time anyway due to its ability's cost. Rohan Warhorse being Tactics should actually command a higher cost (supply and demand). The reason I want to nerf Unexpected Courage is because I think it's overplayed and gives us no reason to want to use the alternatives. Yes, 3 resources is difficult for a 2-sphere deck to pay for, but far from impossible. It actually can become easier if you pair it with Leadership and send Steward of Gondor over to a Spirit Hero. Unexpected Courage is a powerful card and in my opinion it totally deserves a cost of 3, with or without the \"limit 1 per character\" restriction."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123002-what-if-core-set-revised/?do=findComment&comment=1278527","commentId":1278527,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1411757287,"content":"Good job.

Just to compare it with a few other stat givers even from the same sphere:\n\n-Behind the Strong Walls - it restricted to Gondor characters, but it gives +1 Defnese and +X, where X is the stat you're going to use with next action of that character, as he just got readied;\n\n-Halfling Determination - restricted to hobbits, but grants +2 of every stat, including Willpower, so craved by Tactics sphere;\n\n-Khazad! Khazad! - restricted to Dwards, but grants +3 of attack and is free.\n\nSo, what Blade Mastery does is gives one of the Warriors +2 Attack OR +2 Defense ONCE per phase, meaning no overstacking. If you're gonna play it each round and trigger it's return-to-hand ability, you're essentially bringing yourself down to 2 resources per turn instead of 3.\n\n \n\nAs for the Blade of Gondolin, it's fine in comparison to other modern weapons. Modern weapons usually cost 1 and give +1 attack upfront, and either +1 conditional one (like enemy's engagement cost must be higher than your threat) or some bonus effect (like Dwarrowdelf Axe), and thats exactly where Blade of Gondolin falls in. Don't look at the Dwarven Axe, it died as soon Dwarrowdelf Axe got released. And lowering it's cost won't even help, as even then Dwarrowdelf Axe will do it's work better, it'll be a tough one to rework Dwarven Axe so it can fit as a valid choice into the modern arsenal of weapons."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123002-what-if-core-set-revised/?do=findComment&comment=1279113","commentId":1279113,"userName":"MightyRauros","timestamp":1411812236,"content":"Okay, I buy the argument for Blade Mastery!

The \"Favor of the Unexpected Lady Courage\" card is shuffled for potential re-use and offers 1 willpower while you wait to use it.

The core set has a lot of really powerful cards and for players who go out and buy three core sets, they can build really strong decks based on the scenario at hand. I have watched a large number of youtube videos and seen a lot of deck lists since I have started playing this over a year ago, but I have to take each with a grain of salt because even though I have every quest essentially, I only have 1 core set and I don't proxy. It has always baffled me that a lot of folks say they don't like how easy something like Easy Mode can make a game, but have no problem putting Glorfindel and LoV in 95% of their decks and then, along with friends, getting like 4 Unexpected Courage's on Beregond. Now it is definitely within the rules of the game to play it that way, but it isn't always the most fun or the most challenging and part of the reason, in my opinion, is because some of the cards are too powerful (when someone buys multiple core sets - because, again, that is when the most powerful cards come out, like unexpected courage, celebrian stone, etc.). \n\n \n\nI like the idea of hypothetically reducing some of the luster of some of the core set cards. For the record, I don't think that the core set itself had much problems, but I think when you consider how many people buy 3, some of those cards became too powerful.  I, myself, would have preferred a core set with three copies of every card and a little less powerful cards as a result, such as what Trololo and others have suggested.\n\nEdited October 9, 2014 by DC06675"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123002-what-if-core-set-revised/?do=findComment&comment=1293730","commentId":1293730,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1412843093,"content":"Appreciate and respect what you guys are saying but disagree. Out of curiosity why won't you proxy cards DC?\nI personally have 1 core and for around $20 bought a pack of cards that is x1 of each of the cards in the core set you get x2 of. I also proxy a second unexpected courage (but don't run three just the two) and proxy upcoming cards not yet released. This works super well and is very cheap and easy to do. It eliminates the issue of only having one core set as I find that other than unexpected courage the x2 of cards are better and more important than the x1 of cards in the core set.. The core set quests are also pretty **** hard (minus the first) if you only have the core set and would be even harder if core set player cards were weaker.\n\nAlso do you play nightmare? Certain nightmare quests require you to bring your absolute a game or you will get stomped. Without some of the powerhouse core cards (the way they are now) they would be hard to a point that I think would not be fun.\n\nEdited October 9, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123002-what-if-core-set-revised/?do=findComment&comment=1293732","commentId":1293732,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1412843697,"content":"Please, note that while I \"nerfed\" some spotlights of core set, I bumped a lot of weakling of core set to the adequate state, which kinda balances things out, especially for a core set.
