It's a description of an event. Saruman commits treason (does the White Council form a true legal entity? I'm not sure Eru will accept that technicality when it goes to trial).\n\n \n\nThe Darkest Betrayal is a betrayal that must have taken place at night, but it wasn't just dark it was the darkest. No betrayal has ever taken such low-light conditions before.\n\nEdited July 11, 2016 by Edheliad"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224523-the-darkest-betrayal/?do=findComment&comment=2304531","commentId":2304531,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1468262597,"content":"Plenty of betrayals have taken place in low-light conditions, but Tolkien stays away from those sort of stories."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224523-the-darkest-betrayal/?do=findComment&comment=2304548","commentId":2304548,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1468262949,"content":"Indeed.
