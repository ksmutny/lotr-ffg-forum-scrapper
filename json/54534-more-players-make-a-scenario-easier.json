So far, in my experience, only The Hunt For Gollum gets harder with more players and easier on solo (have yet to fail it playing solo). "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54534-more-players-make-a-scenario-easier/?do=findComment&comment=540254","commentId":540254,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1318320261,"content":"Kiwina said:\n\nEmyn Muil is arguably harder with more players because there are so many locations.  You'd add two-four to the staging area each round and only remove one at most without help from a Northern Tracker.\n\n\n\nYes is true but when you get the tracker in play the game start to be walk in the park most of the time (sometimes tracker come to late but is only in 1 time from 8)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54534-more-players-make-a-scenario-easier/?do=findComment&comment=540255","commentId":540255,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1318320394,"content":"In my opinion Hunt for Gollum is not become harder with more players is becoming longer yes.

Never felt nervous during Carrock, whereas in HFG, there is almost always the feeling that one single questing phase draw can kill you right there and then (multiple Clues + Hunters and it has bad Treacheries for late in the game if your threat is 35+, you can get reset back to stage 2b just like that).

I mean : Minimum 6 difficult. \n\nCarrock is easy for solo. But with 2 players start to be more difficult. I also beat it easy solo but 2 players can be really big problem.\n\nHFG was never problem for me cose any locations oriented quest kills by Tracker even one is enough.I really dont understand how they can make him so powerful????He is not only good for locations but also very good fighter and defender. And dont tell me he cost 4 and this is problem. With steward of gondor you can play him on second turn. In solo game i dont think you can build up good deck without steward of gondor anyway or???\n\nBut if we look on all quests and how is game going for me game is still to easy.Ok now is going to be better but still game target more casual players then proff. for now.Also card pool is quite limited  but i remember first set of Lotr tcg By Decipher there was much more different strategy(even with only 1 felowship set).\n\nI really want to have more different strategies with spheres and more hard quests. But ok if March and Return will be diffiucult 7 8 or 8 9 that ok. Eventually they should to increase difficulty cose new players cards make players deck more and more powerful.\n\nI dont want to have the feeling when after 4 or 5 first turns you already understand you win and now is only question if victory point and time.\n\nRhosgobel and Osgiliath change that and i like it.\n\nAnyway Dam is always nice to talk to you cose in my opinion you are there one i can call proff player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54534-more-players-make-a-scenario-easier/?do=findComment&comment=540800","commentId":540800,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1318398316,"content":"The_Big_Show said:\n\nGlaurung said:\n\n \n\nThe_Big_Show said:\n\n \n\nOsgilliath is another one like The Hunt For Gollum, it is reasonable solo but once you add  even just one extra player it gets tough.\n\n \n\n \n\nIn y experience Ogiliath is relly difficult solo.

But try 3 players there is more 3 scout and +3 cards coming from encounter deck.\nBut still quest is hard by 1 by 2 by 3. I heard by 4 is most hard ever.

But with 2 players start to be more difficult. I also beat it easy solo but 2 players can be really big problem.\n\nOnly quest I've played solo (or real-solo, just 1 deck) has been PTM. All other plays have been 2-deck, either solo or with a friend. However, Carrock has been not a problem in the least and these are the same decks that struggled against Anduin (3-3) and HFG (4-2 with very narrow squeeky wins). Even without threat reduction, you can fairly easily enter stage 2 with close to (or slightly over) 40 threat. Each party takes on 2 Trolls, so +6 threat assuming you can't Feint or kill Louis. And the Trolls shouldn't really last more than a two turns engaged, with Grim Resolve + For Gondor taking down three in a turn isn't hard.\n\nHopefully I'll be getting my MaO this week, but when I'll get around to playing it is another issue, I still have Rhosgobel and Escape from DG for 6 plays each (schedule has Rhosgobel still planned for this month) and should have Emyn Muil before I've played those so MaO might have to wait a while (stupid other games lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] ). Next month EM + Escape, then the next AP + MaO in December perhaps."}]}
