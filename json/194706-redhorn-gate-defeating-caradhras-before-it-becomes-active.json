You will remove Caradhras from your victory display and put it back into play as the active location. Cards in the victory display are not removed from the game and can still be referenced by effects. If players get too far ahead of themselves via card effects, they’ll find a return journey is necessary!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194706-redhorn-gate-defeating-caradhras-before-it-becomes-active/?do=findComment&comment=1913103","commentId":1913103,"userName":"Fluke Starbucker","timestamp":1448911181,"content":"I didn't see that initially.  Thank you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194706-redhorn-gate-defeating-caradhras-before-it-becomes-active/?do=findComment&comment=1913108","commentId":1913108,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1448911319,"content":"> I didn't see that initially.  Thank you.\n\n \n\nNo problem.  It's hard to keep track of everything at this point :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]"}]}
