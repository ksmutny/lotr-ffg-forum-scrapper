I am not talking about the quest itself. I am asking about the actual running of the event.\n\nWere groups/players randomly assigned? Or, did you pick your own? Teams of two only, or were there 3-4 player groups playing as well? Were there several tables specifically allocated for it? Was there a referee or two walking around to help explain cards? Was it an honor system, or a judge at each table? Etc.\n\nI ask partially because, of course, many people are hoping that FFG will work out some sort of tournament system for LOTR:LCG (like they initally said would happen). So, I am curious what were the official mechanics for this event.\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70137-battle-of-laketown-event-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=684407","commentId":684407,"userName":"lpknight21","timestamp":1346237139,"content":" You wrote down your deck that you will be playing with… if you were by yourself you were paired with someone. They wanted two player games although we had one three player game. Essentially everyone sat down at the 2 allocated tables for the event and played the quest… you could play as many times as long as it was in the allotted time frame. And there were some FFG guys walking around… namely Caleb Grace and Lucas… who are part of the design team for the game. They talked to me for a little while and watched our game develop… but no judges or anything like that… just casual play."}]}
