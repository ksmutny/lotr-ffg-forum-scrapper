No mistakes as i see.\n\nFollowing by night is really weird card. 90% of the games is just doing nothing. I play same like you (just choose second and nothing happens).\n\nVery solid dwarf deck.\n\nWas funny to see Bombur with axe killing orcs around!\n\nShow us more! RTR is very easy quest.It was no problem for you at all. Show how you deal with MIO or any quests difficulty 6 or more.I like to see it.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68163-youtube-vid-of-my-dwarf-solo-deck/?do=findComment&comment=665036","commentId":665036,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1343482413,"content":"Good and solid game with helpful infos for new players!\n\nOne minor mistake happened during the last round: you didn't activate Lonbeard Elder's response, after which he would have lost 1 WP.

Can you really choose the last option if there's no enemies engaged with you? I mean, it does say If able, and if no one is engaged I'd say that mean they are not able to attack.
