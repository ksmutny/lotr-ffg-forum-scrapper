If I only have one exhausted ally out and he happens to be defending against an enemy, does the damage that is now \"unblocked\" get distributed onto one of my heroes? This is the way I have been playing it, and I have a feeling this is correct...I just hate this card if that is so. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] It has happened many a time and is very frustrating!!! Especially when your defender is Beorn. Any help confirming my suspicion? Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52796-what-happens-to-damage-when-my-defending-ally-is-forced-back-into-my-hand/?do=findComment&comment=525162","commentId":525162,"userName":"GhostWolf69","timestamp":1315385667,"content":"If the Assigned Defender is Removed before Damage is Applied, the Attack is considered Undefended.\n\n/wolf"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52796-what-happens-to-damage-when-my-defending-ally-is-forced-back-into-my-hand/?do=findComment&comment=525173","commentId":525173,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1315387726,"content":" Indeed, I thought that, thank you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52796-what-happens-to-damage-when-my-defending-ally-is-forced-back-into-my-hand/?do=findComment&comment=525212","commentId":525212,"userName":"Style75","timestamp":1315398463,"content":"This is a cruel, cruel game and yet we love it so much.

Brought in Gandalf to block the Hill Troll, Gandy was the only ally out there, poof, back to hand, 6dmg undefended, bye-bye Theodred. Didn't help that Aragorn had defended against the HT a turn before and was sitting on 4dmg. Suffice it to say the game ended in defeat."}]}
