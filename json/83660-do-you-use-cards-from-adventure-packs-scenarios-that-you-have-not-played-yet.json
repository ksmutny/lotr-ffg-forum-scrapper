While I did open them and sort out the cards I have this weird thing that I like to beat a scenario with only the cards released up until that point.\n\nAfterwards I'll play it again with different kinds of decks using all the cards but I like to do it at least once (and not just a flukey win) with only the card pool that was available at the time. I don't view using newer cards as cheating at all and I actually think they have handled power creep pretty well (though a bit is always inevitable).\n\nI guess it's just a weird quirk I have that I like to do it with older cards first and experiment with the more limited deck building options before trying anything else. But that's what I find fun, if you think you would have more fun dumping all your packs into one to create your ultimate deck to run wild on Passage through Mirkwood do it.\n\nThe game is designed to be fun, play it the way you want."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83660-do-you-use-cards-from-adventure-packs-scenarios-that-you-have-not-played-yet/?do=findComment&comment=794293","commentId":794293,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1368248355,"content":"All the best cards are in the core set imo.
