During combat, Legolas kills an enemy, producing 2 more progress tokens and moving us on to stage 3, the Ambush.\n\nWhile revealing the 4 cards for the Ambush we draw 1 location, 1 treachery and 2 Crows. Does Thalin`s ability still trigger at this point, thereby wiping out the crows? There were no other enemies in play so this would give us a quick win on stage 3.\n\nHe was committed to the quest and the Crows were revealed from the Encounter Deck; there is nothing on Thalin`s card to specify which phase of the turn he does or doesn`t apply to.\n\nAssuming the answer to this question is yes,how do we feel about Thalin`s ability entering the last stage of Journey through Mirkwood; for instance if you have to pull Ungoliant`s Spawn out of the encounter discard pile, does Thalin still damage him?\n\nMany apologies if this has already been covered, I read the posts about Thalin vs. Surge but didn`t find anything on these scenarios."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63169-does-thalins-damage-ability-last-the-entire-round/?do=findComment&comment=618169","commentId":618169,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1334566734,"content":" A character is committed to the quest only in the quest phase.

You revealed stage 3 during the quest phase -- you hadn't moved on to the travel phase yet -- so the crows would be taken out by Thalin's ability.
