We in Germany will like not have that opportunity unless someone buys the English PoD's and runs a privat event (which still would miss the german version and the fellowship goodies).

You can make home proxy of some cards you own to your personal use and use them to build more deck. I can build this 12 decks challenge pretty easily with this restriction. The most problematic part will be boromir hero, galadriel hero, Arwen (hero and ally), Amarthuil hero and of course Glorfindel (hero and ally). And steward of Gondor.\n\nBut even without duplicating cards among decks it seem clearly possible because you have a lot of strategic where the main cards are different (all tribal decks, Caldara, Elrond, secret, Boromir core, Gimli&Legolas, hàma.deck, mono lore loot) but it can be hard to win. If using all cards and unfair strategy I'm sure I can build deck who will win :).\n\nBut in fact I will just need 6 decks because I will probably play this scenario with 3 tables of 2 players.\n\nI hope this scenario will be soon available in french too. I think I will buy one in english and then one more in french when it get released."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/244989-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas-is-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=2785308","commentId":2785308,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1494698122,"content":"> 12 hours ago, Authraw said:\n> \n> Good luck!
