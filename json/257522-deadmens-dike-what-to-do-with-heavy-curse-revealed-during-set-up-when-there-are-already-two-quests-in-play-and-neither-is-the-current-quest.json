(Counts as a Condition attachment with the text: “When a player plays a card, increase its cost by 1 if there is a card that has the same title in its owner’s discard pile.”)\n\nAs I am in Set-up and there are two quests in play, neither of which has yet been declared the current quest, what do I do with Heavy Curse? Attach it to the main quest? First player decides which quest to attach it to? Discard it because there is no \"current quest\"?\n\nHas anyone dealt with this before?\n\nAlso, is it fair to assume that the effects of multiple copies in play of Heavy Curse stack (I got hit by that several times in previous games). \n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts. \n\n \n\nffg_MEC38_67.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2017_08/ffg_MEC38_67.jpg.a40942f52a6d8a0a31b359fe9e294e05.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2017_08/ffg_MEC38_67.jpg.a40942f52a6d8a0a31b359fe9e294e05.jpg]\n\nffg_MEC38_66.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2017_08/ffg_MEC38_66.jpg.3658d7dfa444b8a2429ba3c0a92a96b0.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2017_08/ffg_MEC38_66.jpg.3658d7dfa444b8a2429ba3c0a92a96b0.jpg]\n\nEdited August 29, 2017 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/257522-deadmens-dike-what-to-do-with-heavy-curse-revealed-during-set-up-when-there-are-already-two-quests-in-play-and-neither-is-the-current-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2957824","commentId":2957824,"userName":"Emilius","timestamp":1504008872,"content":"During setup you are following stage 1B instructions, so the current quest is the main quest.\n\nAnyway, the choice of the current quest is done only at the beginning of the quest phase and finish at the end of the same quest phase.\n\nSo in the other phases the main quest is the active \"via the quest deck\".\n\n \n\nThe rules says:\n\nAt the beginning of each quest phase, if there are one or more side quests in the staging area, the rst player may choose one to be the “current quest” until the end of the phase instead of the quest card that is currently active via the quest deck. While a side quest is the current quest, any progress that the players make is placed onto that side quest and any card e ects that target the “current quest” target that side quest. Progress must still be placed on the active location before it can be placed on a side quest. Any progress that is made beyond the current quest’s total quest points is discarded; do not place progress on any other quest card in play. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/257522-deadmens-dike-what-to-do-with-heavy-curse-revealed-during-set-up-when-there-are-already-two-quests-in-play-and-neither-is-the-current-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2958378","commentId":2958378,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1504024543,"content":"Thanks for that, Emilius.\n\nShould've known to check the rules insert before posting. :-)"}]}
