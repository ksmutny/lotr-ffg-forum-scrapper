It's just because between the interesting effects on them, victory 1, the threat being equal to quest points and the fact they're the only locations in the pack without the Deep keyword, they match up to all the same elements on the other cards which are in the Caves deck. And since I know there was at least one mistake in the rulesheet (the discrepancy on when to flip the quest cards) I wondered if this was another such.\"\n\nAnd got this response from Caleb:\n\n\"You are absolutely right: Throat of the Mountain and Dagnir’s Hoard are supposed to be part of the Caves deck. I’m so bummed that I didn’t remember to include that in the rules! I’m sorry for the confusion. Thank you for bringing to my attention. I will include the correct rules in the next FAQ and make sure that reprints have the correct text.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294893-mount-gundabad-caves-deck/?do=findComment&comment=3732915","commentId":3732915,"userName":"Boromore","timestamp":1562080224,"content":"Good spot - I'd have never have worked that out on my own.

After re-reading the rules insert and card several times I kind of just shrugged and was like ok sure seems a bit gnarly for a normal non-nightmare encounter card but sure. Never saw throat of the mountain but yeah I just played as though Dagnir's Hoard was a normal reveal from the encounter deck. Luckily It was late game so the 7 threat meant more or less nothing but had it appeared early game that could have been awful. Will have to remember to include these two locations in the caves deck next time. Well spotted!!"}]}
