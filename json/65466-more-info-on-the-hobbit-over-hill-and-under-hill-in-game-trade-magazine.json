If treasures were numbered right after player cards and we were supposed to get 5 heroes (as hinted), it would mean we might be getting 15 player cards? Maybe 14 if Orcrist were not the first treasure (Glamdring may come first alphabetically). 14 would make sense, I think I read somewhere we're getting only 1 Baggins sphere player card (beside Bilbo himself), 3 for each of the original four spheres plus a neutral? What do you think?"}]}
