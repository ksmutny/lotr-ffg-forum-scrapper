If I get hit with a card like Undisturbed Bones (When Revealed: Each player must deal X damage to an ally he controls. X is the number of allies he controls.), can I assign the damage to the Sailor of Lune and in turn have the Sailor take no damage? Or am I simply not allowed to assign the damage to the Sailor and thus forced to assign it to another ally?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220672-sailor-of-lune-can-damage-be-assigned-to-it/?do=findComment&comment=2230495","commentId":2230495,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1463991491,"content":"The general rule is that when faced with a choice of that nature you must resolve it as fully as possible; meaning that you would have to chose an ally eligible to take damage, if possible.\n\nIt´s in the FAQ somewhere."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220672-sailor-of-lune-can-damage-be-assigned-to-it/?do=findComment&comment=2230656","commentId":2230656,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1464007525,"content":"> The general rule is that when faced with a choice of that nature you must resolve it as fully as possible; meaning that you would have to chose an ally eligible to take damage, if possible.\n> \n> It´s in the FAQ somewhere.\n\n \n\nWhile this may be what the developers decide, it's certainly not clear.  I've asked the developers a question regarding several damage effects and their respective resolutions with respect to Sailor of Lune.\n\n \n\nSome damage effects say \"Player MUST deal X damage\" (like in the Undisturbed Bones example) which is notably different than \"Player must assign X damage\".  There are also effects with two separate sentences like \"Choose a character.  Then, deal X damage to that character\".\n\n \n\nThere are a few other types I included in my email that I can't remember off the top of my head, but these types of damaging effects all have subtle differences and could likely have different rulings when applied to Sailor of Lune.  Hopefully I'll hear back soon so we can have a definitive answer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220672-sailor-of-lune-can-damage-be-assigned-to-it/?do=findComment&comment=2230699","commentId":2230699,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1464009587,"content":"I'll be interested to hear what response you receive, cmabr002.

To me, that doesn't necessarily mean the Sailor is an ineligible target.\n\n \n\nWell, it gets a little messy, to me.\n\n \n\nI think if a card says \"must deal damage\" you won't be able to target Sailor of Lune with it because it says \"must\", but you could also argue, that you must first assign damage to the target, and Sailor of Lune doesn't say it can't be \"assigned\" damage...\n\n \n\nThen there are cards like Dol Guldur Orcs.  \"Choose a questing character.\"  Okay, so you choose Sailor of Lune.  \"Deal 2 damage to that character\", but you clearly can't.  Is she ineligible to be \"chosen\"?  I think you can choose her...but can't damage her\n\n \n\nWe also have treacheries that say \"Assign X damage to characters committed to the quest where X is number of characters\".  Clearly it is completely broken if Sailor of Lune can be assigned 40 damage and then \"cannot take it\".  Perhaps that means you cannot assign any damage to Sailor of Lune...or maybe it just means you can only assign as much damage to Sailor of Lune as her remaining hit points...so she could soak up 2 of that damage if she was at full health...\n\n \n\nSo yeah...I'm looking forward to getting a response on these matters :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220672-sailor-of-lune-can-damage-be-assigned-to-it/?do=findComment&comment=2230792","commentId":2230792,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1464013563,"content":"If it's possible to assign damage to the Saiilor of Lune at all I'm pretty sure you can't assign more damage to him than his remaining hit points, that's been the ruling with regards to archery (which as I recall is assigned point by point then dealt all at once, so if you could assign beyond hit points you could take any mount of archery by just nuking a single chump ally)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220672-sailor-of-lune-can-damage-be-assigned-to-it/?do=findComment&comment=2230807","commentId":2230807,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1464013946,"content":"> If it's possible to assign damage to the Saiilor of Lune at all I'm pretty sure you can't assign more damage to him than his remaining hit points, that's been the ruling with regards to archery (which as I recall is assigned point by point then dealt all at once, so if you could assign beyond hit points you could take any mount of archery by just nuking a single chump ally).\n\n \n\nYeah, that's how it should be if you can assign it to her.  On a side note, is there a reason you can assign more damage to Frodo than his remaining hit points, or can you not?  If there is Archery 5, can Frodo eat it all, or can I only have him eat 2 of it?  Him being attacked is a little different than having damage assigned to him.\n\nEdited May 23, 2016 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220672-sailor-of-lune-can-damage-be-assigned-to-it/?do=findComment&comment=2230893","commentId":2230893,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1464017240,"content":"You can only assign Frodo 2 points of archery, as I recall, that's where the ruling I was talking about came from.
