Try right-clicking the table.\n\nMy personal preference is for OCTGN over TTS. It's just way faster for me to play. I can go from having a deck built in ringsdb to playing said deck in seconds. And once you learn all the OCTGN hotkeys for stuff there's no comparison."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278173-tabletop-simulator-vs-octgn/?do=findComment&comment=3382914","commentId":3382914,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1529759724,"content":"> 6 hours ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> OCTGN does allow you to save the game state.
