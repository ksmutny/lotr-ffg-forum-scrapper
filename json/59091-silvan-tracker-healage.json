Is A character only meant to be read as 1 single character per copy of the Silvan Tracker or is it meant to include that all eligible silvan characters can heal 1 wound based on the presence of a single Silvan Tracker?\n\nAny and all inputs are welcome"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59091-silvan-tracker-healage/?do=findComment&comment=580640","commentId":580640,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326789981,"content":"it means that when any card readies during the refresh phase with the Silvan trait it heals.

Don´t know if there are any more but I´d still say that´s a pretty decent start to base a silvan heal ability"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59091-silvan-tracker-healage/?do=findComment&comment=580647","commentId":580647,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326791908,"content":"exactly.. a start but not a real tribe yet... after some more player cards it will be a thing but for now I do not think it is really working.
