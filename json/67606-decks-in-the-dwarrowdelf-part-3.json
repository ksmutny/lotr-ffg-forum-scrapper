Not ground-breaking, but it was alright. Only one thing really bothered me: he repeatedly used the word \"stand\" instead of the word \"ready.\"\n\n\n\nFor me this was one of the things that bothered me also, official article should use official terminology.\n\nI didn't want to go much into detail about this deck but I might have to a little bit. For one, if this should be full Bilbo-player-type-deck, then I would expect all cards be centered around the theme, that being Noldor and Dúnedain of the North. Then I don't understand cards like Snowbourn Scout, Horn of Gondor and Steward of Gondor.\n\nAs for the mechanics, there are indeed some interesting decisions. Like the sole copy of the Sword, practically the strongest Aragorn's combo. Then Horn of Gondor with the total number of 9 allies (Valiant Sacrifice also not being particularly strong option for the same reason); more so with the Steward and very cheap card pool. And as stated, for mostly a solo deck, the inclusion of Rivendell Bow is again rather odd.\n\nI still see this as an alright supporting deck with the other player having Spirit-major deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67606-decks-in-the-dwarrowdelf-part-3/?do=findComment&comment=659808","commentId":659808,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1342523778,"content":"Angus Lee said:\n\nmuemakan said:\n\n \n\nChanged Aragorn to Loragorn and this helps with the high starting threat. \n\n \n\n \n\nCould you please elaborate how can this switch helps?  I know Loragorn can reset the threat level once in the game, but still the threat level is in the high level (32+)…\n\n\n\nI play a Loragorn and the Ninja Twins deck now and so am pretty familiar with how to get the most of them.  I had forgotten that Aragorn used the name Estel and will change my deck name now though.  But to answer your question…\n\nThe twins are killing machines, especially against low HP enemies like the goblins in Khazad-Dum.  When playing solo the big problem is usually gaining control of the board at the beginning of the game when you have extra event cards in the staging area.  But when playing with Loragorn you don't care about threat.  This gives the advantage that you can clear the enemies early and let your threat add up.  (You still must avoid location lock in the long term though.)  Once you have control of the board, every time a location comes out you basically save your resource token for Elladan (tactics twin) so that he can do a double attack later.  I always put Steward on Elrohir (leadership twin), so resources for him are not a problem.\n\nBut… you still need to be able to quest in the long term.  For that I like the Sword and the Stone.  Those items give Aragorn Leadership and Spirit icons, of which the Spirit is more useful.  Get your Arwen out asap to help with the questing (she'll have 3 WP if you have the sword out) and to give Elrohir a +1 def.  Now you can play Elrond's Council (and Ghaladrim's Greeting), but I usually wait until I have a couple of those in hand AND control of the board.  Then I activate Aragorn's Lore ability and drop my threat all at once.  If you have any 'boss monsters' to face at the end of the game you can now Unseen Strike them, and with the right attachments you probably have Elladan attacking for 5 by now anyway.\n\nSo it's a two part answer:  you can afford to let your threat increase early, and then you can use his ability later combined with some other threat reduction cards to really put yourself in a strong position for the later stages of the quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67606-decks-in-the-dwarrowdelf-part-3/?do=findComment&comment=659887","commentId":659887,"userName":"player2052423","timestamp":1342532601,"content":"muemakan said:\n\n Mehhhh, no preview….. and we should look for the last pack at a retailer \"in the next few weeks\".

I also added Gandalf, Erestor, and Faramir and got rid of the Sword that was Broken, Snowbourn Scout, and Dawn Take You All. I still kept in Keeping Count. I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but I think that it could do some damage in a two player game. For the Tactics Noldor allies, I don't think you need a ton of cards in your hand to make them effective, you just need dead cards in your hand. And you are already getting readying ability from the Twins. It is certainly a theme deck, but if you make some adjustments, it can definitely handle it's own."}]}
