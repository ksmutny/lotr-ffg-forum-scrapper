Then at the end of the quest the other side of the Campaign card tells you to choose one of the boons and one of the burdens to add to the campaign pool moving forwards. Likewise for the other quests, the Campaign card will tell you when to add certain boons and burdens.\n\nOther than that, you take your pick of the three different Fellowship Frodos, but you have to have one, in addition to your regular heroes, and you have to have The One Ring (except in Treason of Saruman). The other Fellowship sphere player cards are optional to include in your deck or not, as with any other player cards."}]}
