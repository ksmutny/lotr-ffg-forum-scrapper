What happens to excess Progress Tokens that Players generate during Questing, while this additional Requirement is not met?\n\nAre they placed upon the quest card anyway? Effectively generating more tokens than needed.\n\nOr are they ignored? Basically enforcing a maximum limit equal to the Listed Requirement.\n\nAny official answer here?\n\n/wolf\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54436-excess-progress-tokens-on-quest-card-possible/?do=findComment&comment=539278","commentId":539278,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1318158784,"content":"You know, I ran into this while playing Anduin and forgot to post about it. I just put the excess tokens on the card (well, I actually left them to the side for easier counting purposes).

That is why I wonder how it's done. I play it like that as well. i.e. just continue to add Tokens.
