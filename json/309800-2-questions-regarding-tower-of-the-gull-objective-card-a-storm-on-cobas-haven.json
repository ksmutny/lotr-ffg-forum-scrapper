I believe that the answer is \"yes,\" as even though the objective is under the player's control, it remains an encounter card and not a player card.\n\nhttp://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Tower-of-the-Gull-ASoCH [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Tower-of-the-Gull-ASoCH]\n\n2) Also, while under player control, Tower of the Gull refreshes at the end of every round, yes (i.e., it can be used once per round so long as it remains under player control)?\n\nWould someone be so kind as to confirm or correct my interpretations?\n\nCheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309800-2-questions-regarding-tower-of-the-gull-objective-card-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=3962027","commentId":3962027,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1594900714,"content":"1) Yes, since as you say it's an encounter card effect.\n\n2) Indeed, a player readies all the cards under its control in the refresh phase, even Objective encounter cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309800-2-questions-regarding-tower-of-the-gull-objective-card-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=3962030","commentId":3962030,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1594901300,"content":"Awesome!
