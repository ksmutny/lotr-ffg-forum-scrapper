I told him that is an easy thing, and also had a simple idea for such a mission. It does not have a very brilliant concept and is short, too. But maybe you want to try it yourself. It has only 4 new cards - just a single sheet to print.\n\nThere is an upload at Boardgamegeek:\n\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/155875/custom-made-quest-through-woods [https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/155875/custom-made-quest-through-woods]\n\nRight after the release of the core set there were some custom made quests in similar style (just new quest cards), but those were limited to the encounter sets from the core set. This mission uses the core set, Khazad-Dun and Heirs of Numenor. Because even HoN is quite old now, the enemies are kind of weak. Should be a walk in the park! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nHave fun.\n\nEdited November 21, 2017 by Flrbb"}]}
