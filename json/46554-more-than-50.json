I personally dislike having more than 50, but I think 54-56 is still fairly doable with a deck that draws well. The last game I played, I had 2 cards left in my deck at the end, I had drawn everything else. But that was a 50 card deck. Definitely lots of lore card draws for a deck that is over the minimum. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46554-more-than-50/?do=findComment&comment=466111","commentId":466111,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1305014467,"content":"There is no maximum, just as long as it is not so many you cannot shuffle it properly. I would never recommend going over the minimum as it makes it harder to get the cards you want/need."}]}
