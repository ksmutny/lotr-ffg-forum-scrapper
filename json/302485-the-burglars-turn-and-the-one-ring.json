Not sure on that one. But even if it were allowed, and even if you could flip The One Ring and get it pseudo-guarded by the active location—both questionable \"ifs\"—it still wouldn't work, as even how it attaches is in a Setup effect that wouldn't trigger if the Ring somehow entered play later in the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302485-the-burglars-turn-and-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=3832321","commentId":3832321,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1574175762,"content":"Let's see if the developer make a special rule for the one ring to let it be played in a burglar turn contract deck.\n\nIt is so fitting thematically it's a pity it can't be played by the rule."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302485-the-burglars-turn-and-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=3832510","commentId":3832510,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1574185485,"content":"That's what I thought as well, so we can't bring it but we may be able to select it for the loot deck? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302485-the-burglars-turn-and-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=3832704","commentId":3832704,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1574195599,"content":"It turns out this is the reason for the hiatus - it's going to take them that long to resolve all the rules issues caused by the contracts and The One Ring"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302485-the-burglars-turn-and-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=3832815","commentId":3832815,"userName":"AllWingsStandyingBy","timestamp":1574202681,"content":"> 7 hours ago, Halberto said:\n> \n> Let's see if the developer make a special rule for the one ring to let it be played in a burglar turn contract deck.\n> \n> It is so fitting thematically it's a pity it can't be played by the rule.\n\n\nExcept, from a practical standpoint, it doesn't really matter.  EVEN IF the One Ring could be taken as a Loot card, there's no reason to do so.  You would lose the advantage of gaining a Master card in your starting hand, and the One Ring itself doesn't do anything (except make it easier to lose the game).  So you'd need to fill your deck with the Master events to have the One Ring do anything, should it be claimed as loot during the game, but until then all of those Master cards in your deck are effectively blank.\n\nJust throw a Magic Ring in the loot deck and pretend it's the One Ring.   The Ruling Ring was a magic ring, afterall."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302485-the-burglars-turn-and-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=3833217","commentId":3833217,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1574262753,"content":"Test the magic ring to see if it’s the one ring?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302485-the-burglars-turn-and-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=3833421","commentId":3833421,"userName":"AllWingsStandyingBy","timestamp":1574279222,"content":"> 4 hours ago, Ywingscum said:\n> \n> Test the magic ring to see if it’s the one ring?\n\n\nDon't forget to travel to a location with Greater Items first, to grab Scroll of Isildur.  Really need that bonus to the test roll."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302485-the-burglars-turn-and-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=3833453","commentId":3833453,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1574282186,"content":"I know right wouldn’t want to get stuck with a minor ring."}]}
