I have 3 copies of ToT in hand. The Dúnedain character is exhausted.\n- I play ToT to exhaust Noldor and ready Dúnedain. Dúnedain now has 4 WP/Att/Def.\n- I play ToT to exhaust Dúnedain and ready Noldor. Noldor now has 4 WP/Att/Def.\n- I play ToT to exhaust Noldor and ready Dúnedain.\n\nAfter the last step does Dúnedain have 4 or 6 WP/Att/Def?\n\nIn other words, can Noldor's printed willpower be added to Dúnedain's stats a second time, or can the boost only be applied once?\n\nEdited August 9, 2017 by jnicol"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255905-can-tale-of-tin%C3%BAviel-stack/?do=findComment&comment=2919739","commentId":2919739,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1502266554,"content":"The boost can be applied twice.

As you note, triggering such an effect between declaring the a defender and resolving the attack means you can have the bonus apply to each of two defenses, instead of just the second. I have seen a lot of people completely miss this opportunity until it was pointed out. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255905-can-tale-of-tin%C3%BAviel-stack/?do=findComment&comment=2920511","commentId":2920511,"userName":"jnicol","timestamp":1502304761,"content":"The double boosted defence thing is very clever indeed.

The rulebook says there is an action window at the end of each step of combat. \n\n> Quote\n> \n> To resolve an attack against an enemy, a player follows these 3 steps, in order. Players may play event cards and take actions at the end of each step.\n> \n> 1. Declare target of attack, and declare attackers. A player does this by choosing 1 enemy with whom he is currently engaged, and exhausting any number of characters as attackers.\n> \n> 2. Determine attack strength. \n> ...\n> 3. Determine combat damage.\n> \n> ...\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255905-can-tale-of-tin%C3%BAviel-stack/?do=findComment&comment=2932706","commentId":2932706,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1503000787,"content":"Because I may have misread this.
