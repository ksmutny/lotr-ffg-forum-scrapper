So, if you defeated a side quest before resolving the quest, all the progress you made from questing successfully would be discarded. This is important to the identity of side quests: You must dedicate at least 1 entire quest phase to defeat a side quest. During the phase that your heroes are adventuring on a side quest, they cannot make any progress on the main quest.\"\nCheers,\nCaleb\nEdited April 22, 2015 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/164372-side-quests-vs-legolas-gondolin-blade-in-combat-phase/?do=findComment&comment=1587333","commentId":1587333,"userName":"Courchevel","timestamp":1429678858,"content":"Thanks GrandSpleen : counter-intuitive for me, but though perfectly in lines with the wording."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/164372-side-quests-vs-legolas-gondolin-blade-in-combat-phase/?do=findComment&comment=1591919","commentId":1591919,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1429901173,"content":"So I think is good choice of rule from Caleb.
