Sometimes i really wonder how FFG run the process. Almost any aspect have some problems.....\n\nLets hope they will fix it properly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53824-official-posting-of-scores-game-assistant-app/?do=findComment&comment=533888","commentId":533888,"userName":"xBeakeRx","timestamp":1317165503,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nI may be in the minority, but I find the current scoring system to be utterly and complete useless.
