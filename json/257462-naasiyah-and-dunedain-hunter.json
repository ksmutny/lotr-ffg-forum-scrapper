The Curious Brandybuck effect is a  \"put into play from your hand\" not a \"play this card\"-style effect so it's certain you can use it with without a Blue hero if you are so inclined."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/257462-naasiyah-and-dunedain-hunter/?do=findComment&comment=2961754","commentId":2961754,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1504160809,"content":"thanks"}]}
