Do you like broken decks, infinite loops and completely dominating games of Lord of the Rings LCG? Then you are in the right place! Because we're talking about the most busted combo since the Zigil Miner deck. In fact, in my opinion this is way worse than the Zigil Miner deck but I'll let you judge for yourself.\n\n\n \n\n\nNow, to start off, I did not find this combo. That well-deserved credit, as far as I know, goes to alogos on the BGG forums (alogos3 here). Give him geekgold if you see him on BGG. He posted about an infinite loop and said: \"If you want to access this dark and forbidden knowledge that ruins the game, PM me.\" Curious, I sent a PM and got a legit reply. After laughing a bit, sharing the combo with my friend (The Janitor on here) and us joking about hilarious ways to abuse it, and reading comments like this: \"There is no five card combo that breaks a game. Sorry, building up a five card combo takes too much effort in and of itself, particularly in a game like this.\" we decided we wanted to try it out. This is then simply the deck I built around the combo.\n\n\n \n\n\nAnyway, let's get to it:\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Deck\n\n\n \n\n\nBeravor\n\n\nBilbo Baggins\n\n\nThalin\n\n\n \n\n\nErebor Hammersmith 3x\n\n\nMaster of Lore 3x\n\n\nMaster of the Forge 3x\n\n\nGleowine 3x\n\n\nMiner of the Iron Hills 2x\n\n\nLongbeard Map-Maker\n\n\nWarden of Healing\n\n\nHaldir of Lorien\n\n\nGildor Inglorion\n\n\nGandalf 3x\n\n\n \n\n\nLegacy of Durin 3x\n\n\nHorn of Gondor 3x\n\n\nBorn Aloft 3x\n\n\nSteward of Gondor\n\n\nSong of Kings\n\n\nSong of Travel\n\n\n \n\n\nDaeron's Runes 3x\n\n\nPeace, and Thought 3x\n\n\nLorien's Wealth 3x\n\n\nWill of the West 2x\n\n\nWealth of Gondor 2x\n\n\nParting Gifts\n\n\nOut of the Wild\n\n\nBlade Mastery 2x\n\n\n \n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Breakdown of Parts\n\n\n \n\n\nHeroes\n\n\n \n\n\nBeravor-For drawing.\n\n\nBilbo Baggins-For drawing. Start yourself as player one.\n\n\nThalin-You need a dwarf hero, and Tactics color for the combo. Thalin is also less threat than Gimli, which is better to hopefully keep enemies off of you early.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo be clear, our games are almost exclusively two or three player games. That's where this deck and combo works the best. The other players' jobs are basically to stall until you lock into the combo. I was sending Bilbo and Thalin questing every turn (for a whopping help of two! Oh and Thalin's ability.) but that was basically it. It was up to my friends to quest, defend, attack, etc. although all they really have to do is make it a few turns, stopping things from getting so bad that you lose in those first few turns or that attacks or things get through to this deck. Any of these three heroes dying will severely damage the probability of getting the combo up, in play and done quickly. I'll let my friend post up his deck if he wants to, but his main parts to help do these companion deck tasks were: a Spirit/Tactics deck with Eowyn, Eleanor and Hama (hopefully with Feint early). Beregond was also involved in the three player games to sentinel block for me.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Combo\n\n\n \n\n\nErebor Hammersmith 3x\n\n\nMaster of Lore 3x\n\n\nLegacy of Durin 3x\n\n\nHorn of Gondor 3x\n\n\nBorn Aloft 3x\n\n\n \n\n\nSo, if it's not obvious to you what you need to do: Get out Legacy of Durin on Thalin and Horn of Gondor on Beravor as quick as possible. My friends' decks also ran copies of these two attachments to help us get them up faster. Then play Master of Lore and name \"Lore Allies\" to cost one cheaper. Now you can play Erebor Hammersmith for one, draw a card from Durin's Legacy, play Born Aloft on Hammersmith, use Born Aloft to send Hammersmith back to hand, gain a resource from Horn of Gondor, and repeat. Hammersmith gets you the Born Aloft back from the top of your discard pile, so, you can do this infinitely to immediately draw your entire draw deck once you hit the combo in your planning phase.\n\n\n \n\n\nDrawing Cards Stuff\n\n\n \n\n\nMaster of the Forge 3x-Really awesome since three of the cards in the combo are attachments.\n\n\nGleowine 3x\n\n\nGildor Inglorion\n\n\nGandalf 3x\n\n\nDaeron's Runes 3x\n\n\nPeace, and Thought 3x-Ridiculous card.\n\n\nLorien's Wealth 3x\n\n\n \n\n\nBeravor is two more cards for you each turn. This may seem like a lot of cards dedicated to drawing but I wouldn't change that at all. It doesn't matter how many slots are for this, it is the single most important thing. All you have to do is find those five cards, so we need to draw away. Peace and Thought is insane. There's games where you'll draw your 6 card starting hand, mulligan if it's not good, draw 2 more cards from start of turn and Bilbo and 2 more from Beravor, and then if one of those 10 is a Peace and Thought, have drawn 15 cards on turn 1. So, to that guy who said \"There is no five card combo that breaks a game.\" and \"building up a five card combo takes too much effort in and of itself, particularly in a game like this.\" you would be wrong. VERY wrong. Not only is this VERY doable but on average we were hitting the combo on about turn three and have even pulled it off as early as turn two. About the only thing that might stop you from doing it that quick often is resources but even that there are ways to help. Hopefully you get Horn of Gondor up early. Or a friend finds one of his Steward of Gondors to play on you. My friend also ran Miruvors to give me an extra resource quickly some games, plus you might be able to use your two extra Born Alofts (after you draw your whole deck) on your friend's allies to trigger Horn of Gondor a couple extra times. Also if your friends find their copies of Legacy of Durin or Horn of Gondor to play on you that will save you some. Try to save as many resources as you can but obviously work to find the combo. Mulligan at the start if you don't have at least two of the combo pieces. \n\n\n \n\n\nInfinite Resources Tricks\n\n\n \n\n\nSong of Kings\n\n\nSteward of Gondor\n\n\nWealth of Gondor 2x\n\n\nParting Gifts\n\n\n\n\nSong of Travel\n\n\nWill of the West 2x\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNow that you've drawn your whole deck, here's where things really go off the rails. Once you draw your whole deck, hopefully you have enough resources to play Song of Kings on Beravor, who then can pay for Steward of Gondor, to make her Gondor trait. Or maybe your friend found his Steward of Gondors to play on you. Now you can play Wealth of Gondor 2x on her to gain two resources, then pay one to play Song of Travel on her and one for Will of the West to shuffle the 2x Wealth of Gondors back into your deck. Pause to do your Hammersmith/Born Aloft bounce trick twice more to get the Wealths back, play them both again, repeat for a net gain of one resource each time. Repeat until you have infinite resources on Beravor. Now play Parting Gifts to move infinite resources to another hero on the table, Will of the West, Hammersmith/Born Aloft, repeat until every hero on the table has infinite resources. Now find your Lorien's Wealths again and loop those infinitely as well on the other players so that they can also all draw their whole decks. Depending on turn order the other players may or may not be able to play all of their characters and attachments like you but if not they'll be joining all of yours next turn.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Ridiculousness\n\n\n \n\n\nLongbeard Map-Maker- Um, him plus infinite resources pretty much takes care of questing…\n\n\nHaldir of Lorien-Ranged/sentinel plus Blade Mastery trick in Combat Phase covers an attack/defend for an emergency on your friends if the turn order on the combo turn made them not be able to get their allies out just yet.\n\n\nWarden of Healing-Infinite heals to everyone.\n\n\nOut of the Wild-This is just ridiculous. Infinite plays of this equals almost nothing left in the Encounter deck. Some quests it leaves nothing or like only a couple cards…\n\n\nBlade Mastery 2x-you can play this infinitely on every character in play in the Combat Phase, soo attack and defense are covered. Also useful for the Siege/Battle Heirs of Numenor quests.\n\n\n \n\n\nNow everyone has their whole deck in their hand and has infinite resources. You can now do basically anything you want. Aside from the last couple of tricks here, there's a BUNCH more stuff you can do and loop infinitely, I just let my friend include these other tricks to lighten the deck load. You'll have to loop Will of the Wests/Lorien's Wealths on the other deck so that they can keep doing their stuff infinitely as well. Some of the best: obviously The Galadhrim's Greeting to reduce everyone's threats to 0. The Riddermark's Finest to clear every location in play. Hail of Stones/Grim Resolve or similar damage tricks to clear every enemy in the staging area. Tactics Boromir/Fortune or Fate to kill every enemy NOT in the staging area. Fortune or Fate to get all heroes back that died in stalling for you. What's almost funny is you'll find a lot of stuff isn't even necessary. I mean, do you even need to kill every enemy in play with events when you have basically infinite attack/defense characters? Do you even need more than a few allies now that you have infinite events to do basically everything?  It's really your choice which tricks to include and which ones become simply arbitrary.\n\n\n \n\n\nMiner of the Iron HIlls 2x- This guy just is for if some of those stupid attachment treacheries make it onto any characters. Also they are other cheap dwarves you can use with Durin's Legacy in an emergency for a couple extra card draws if you're having trouble finding the main combo cards.\n\n\n \n\n\n~~~\n\n\n \n\n\nSo there it is. If everything went well, on about turn three you drew your whole deck, gave every player's heroes infinite resources, let all players draw their whole deck, dropped everyone's threats to 0, eliminated all locations and enemies in (at least) the staging area, eliminated almost the entire Encounter deck, played every one of your allies and attachments (and depending on turn order, your friend's allies/attachments), plus other tricks.\n\n\n \n\n\nObviously there might be some games where you don't hit the combo and then everything goes to hell. But it hasn't happened yet. And as long as you don't actually lose the game, you can always pull all the way back once you do hit the combo. Your scores will be ridiculous too, and are only limited by the +10 points per round rules. Our best scores right now are a 13 on Into the Pit and a -3 on BATTLE FOR LAKE-TOWN. With the new scoring system even. I didn't even know you could enter a negative score but the quest log lets you and even says \"use negative numbers if needed\". *Shrug*. There's a few quests that could still be problematic but almost all of them you will destroy. Ironically, the Battle for Lake-town, the hardest quest available, is probably the best one for scores with this because of all the victory points. You just have to hopefully not hit like the 'attack everyone' Smaug or other bad stuff early in that quest.\n\n\n \n\n\nI'm not quite sure how this will do solo. It probably depends on the quest. Obviously it will be harder, especially for early resources and blocking, but maybe still doable on many quests as long as you can survive. I'm not sure what I would cut to fit some of the other infinite loop trick cards though. Hilariously you don't even have to quest very hard (or at all!) as long as you find the combo before you hit 50 threat.\n\n\n \n\n\nMy main motivation for posting this, honestly, is to just bring awareness to the combo and to FFG. I kind of hate errata but obviously something here needs fixed. I'd hate to start going to those new game store events in January when the game night kits come out only to see this combo everywhere. It would kind of put a damper on the premiere of game night events right off the bat, in my opinion.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhat part should they even fix though? Legacy of Durin? Master of Lore since he seems like something that could be abused later on as well? Wealth of Gondor, though I think you could then still maybe do an infinite resource loop then with 3x errata'ed Zigil Miners, Lure of Moria and Will of the West once your deck is out. What also scares me is that certain other parts of this might end up being broken on their own without the combo. Mainly Wealth of Gondor. Like, you can easily draw through 15 cards on turn 1 with a Peace and Though and if you hit a second Peace and Thought in those 15, you could be through 23 cards by turn 2 without playing any other drawing cards or Daeron's Runes or other players playing drawing cards on you. 23 cards! That's almost half your deck. And this is post-Beravor errata. If we can get through our deck any faster with future cards, Wealth of Gondor 2x/Will of the West infinite resources trick will be ridiculous on it's own and you won't even need the Hammersmith parts.\n\n\n \n\n\nSorry if I over explained some stuff here. I really just wanted to make sure everyone, veteran or apprentice alike, was fully aware of what this deck is capable of. I'm honestly surprised more people aren't talking about this yet.\n\n\n \n\n\nAnyway, I would love to hear your thoughts. I'm sure some of you might even see ways to improve the deck and make it even more stupid, hah. Maybe my friend will post his deck as well, so you can at least see our version of a companion stall deck.\n\n\n \n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n \n\n\n-Matt\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76284-the-erebor-hammer-deck-the-most-broken-deck-since-ziggy-miner/?do=findComment&comment=739578","commentId":739578,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1356620202,"content":"Why would you want to do this, though?

I guess the motivation for doing it though would be good scores in the quest log or the prize support in the game night kits, etc. That kind of stuff. That's what worries me more than anything.

Stuff like the Zigil Miner, Will of the West etc, they're cards I didn't expect to see so early in a game's development. I mean, Will of the West is a core set card! Good lord, it makes you wonder sometimes whether the designers know what they're doing. I do remember the discussions about the Zigil deck where people were including loads of high-cost cards in their decks to get the resources they wanted, then they brought out scenarios that discard allies from play (Long Dark) and that use your high-cost cards against you (Foundations of Stone), which I've always thought were elegant ways of countering these ludicrous decks. It makes me think the designers do know what they're doing, and were just waiting for people to get comfortable with these crazy decks when they then make scenarios you don't want to play with them. So now there's a stupid idea of drawing your deck into your hand during setup or whatever, so what's the betting we'll be getting scenarios that say \"during the planning phase, reveal x cards from the encounter deck. x is the number of cards in your hand\" or \"each enemy (or location) in the staging area has threat equal to the cards in total in each player's hand\" and the like? Having the encounter deck copy the players could be interesting, too, so every time you bring an ally back from your discard pile, you have to put an enemy into the staging area or whatever. Basically, what fresh hell have they got in store for us now?\n\nThis doesn't really have any effect on the already-released scenarios, of course, but then up until they announced these new nightmare cards, I was firmly of the opinion that the designers thought we all only played the current adventure pack, and the other quests would gather dust once they were \"beaten\" etc. I dislike errata, either to cards or the rules themselves, so I hope they find some other way. The idea of mixing treacheries into the player deck sounds absolutely inspired, I'd like to see something like that happen. I don't want to give the impression that I think the game was badly designed from the start, but the fact that there are no upper limits has always really bugged me. Even the fact the rulebook suggests using alternatives when you run out of tokens etc - to me, if I've pulled all of the resources that were in the pool when I started, that's it, I don't go digging around for change to use! So I suppose if it came down to a rulebook erratum to introduce a hand cap or draw cap, I'd be happy enough with it.
