WWE has its Summerslam in August, doesn't really seem like summer anymore at that time. Also, the Finnish version (as well as the Spanish I think) were available at the end of August, so one could argue that it did come out during summer. Still waiting on the English version though in most parts, some stores do have it (based on BGG threads)."}]}
