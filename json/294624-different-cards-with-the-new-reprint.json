One is more simple, preserving the standard use case while preventing massive abuse of the effect. \"Spend one resource from attached hero's resource pool to give attached hero +1 attack (or defense, for blood). Limit 3 times per phase.\"\n\nThe second option is a much larger change, but leaves a card that is more interesting to play, I think, and preserves the massive attack potential of the existing effect while still removing the potential for abuse. \"Discard [blood/fire] to give attached hero +X [attack/defense] until the end of the phase, where X is the number of resources in the attached hero's resource pool.\"\n\nWarden of Healing: Nowhere near as bad as Blood or Fire, but it's still much too efficient. I think that it's base stats and effect are in the realm of just design around it, but it's reading response definitely needs a \"limit once per round\" errata.\n\nSteward:  Is probably fine.  Maybe make it enter play exhausted?\n\nCourage:  also probably fine, but I wouldn't mind if they made it \"limit one per hero.\"\n\nTest of will:  no errata.  It is probably the most meta warping card in the game, but I don't think that you can change it without destroying it, and the game needs it.\n\nVilya: extremely powerful. Broken? I don't think so. Needs errata? Probably not. If anything, give it \"attached character cannot be readied by player card effects,\" just to make the cost of the action less easy to overcome.\n\n> 8 hours ago, Yepesnopes said:\n> \n> And by the way! For when an errata on the northern tracker!? That is so OP that the whole location mechanics of the game is wrapped around it!\n\n That's another simple one. \"After northern tracker commits to the quest, place one progress on up to X locations in the staging area, where X is one more than the number of players in the game.\"\n\nI'm actually more concerned with Asfaloth. At the very least, make it restricted. There isn't much else to do without completely reworking the card. The best I can think of is to make it restricted, remove the \"2 progress if attached to Glorfindel\" ability,  and instead make it like Snowmane. \"If attached hero is Glorfindel, asfaloth loses the restricted keyword.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3696057","commentId":3696057,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1556994199,"content":"> 8 minutes ago, GrandSpleen said:\n> \n> How about: When Northern Tracker exhausts to commit to the quest, place 1 progress on X locations in the staging area.  X is the number of players in the game.\n\nHeh, great minds think alike.

And how often do you need the same defender to cancel more than one shadow effect in the same round? Because those are the only times the errata will make a difference.\n\nI don't pay attention to the shadows I discard, but I'd be surprised if I didn't cancel more than one shadow effect in the nearly every quest (putting readying on hero defenders is a high priority).  And in Carn Dum it happens frequently, even solo.  Losing a hero defender is by far my most common reason to scoop, so if you need to cancel two shadows *even once* in a quest, it can matter a lot.\n\nHow often do I intend to put two restricted attachments on a ABB target?  Let's see.  In Dori, Outlands and Dwarves, I want to put ABB on LeAragorn, also with Gondorian Shield and Celebrian's Stone (restricted, for no good reason).  Ring of Barahir gives him Lore for ABB.\n\nIn Dori and the Twins, ABB is meant for Elrohir, courtesy of Song of Wisdom.  Elven Mail, Gondorian Shield, and Armored Destrier are all restricted targets I like on him first -- Armored Destrier at least partially compensates for the nerf, except that the restricted ABB makes it less likely for it to be playable.\n\nIn Dori, Side-Quests and LeEomer (unpublished), ABB is meant for Fastred, courtesy of Song of Wisdom -- and he needs it with only 3 hp!  The intended restricted attachment is Raiment of War, which simultaneously buffs his defense and HP.  Oh, and it takes two restricted spots so it can't be mixed with ABB *at all*.  Thanks a lot.\n\nIn Dori and the Rings, Elrond is the ABB target.  He also is the target for Gondorian Shield and Elven Mail.\n\nIn Dori and Boromir, TaBoromir is the ABB target, courtesy of Song of Wisdom.  He is also the target for Gondorian Shield and Armored Destrier -- originally that was just to save threat, but after Boromir was nerfed it assumed new importance.  It could also mitigate the ABB nerf, except that they made it restricted and now there's not room -- he needs his shield.\n\nIn Dori and Rossiel, Rossiel is the ABB target, and also for Elven Mail and Gondorian Shield.  This is the fellowship least affected, both because Balin is in the fellowship and because she's not also a Steward of Gondor target, the Shield is just a flat +1 for her.\n\nIn Dori and the Silvans, Celeborn is the ABB target, courtesy of Song of Wisdom.  Elven Mail, Gondorian Shield, and Armored Destrier are all available.  Celeborn is also the Steward of Gondor target, as he is in a Leadership/Lore Silvan deck, together with Song of Wisdom he can.\n\nIn Dori and the Ents there are two possible targets -- LeFaramir is the eventual defender with Song of Wisdom (to help pay for Green ents), and he also wants Armored Destrier and Gondorian Shield.  The other target is Treebeard, an excellent lore defender to handle early defense if needed -- but he can't have restricted attachments and is now cut off from ABB.  The best lore defender -- no ABB.\n\nIn Dori, Traps, and Rangers LoFaramir is the ABB target, and only Gondorian Shield (limit 1) is an intended restricted attachment.  That's because this fellowship was constructed before Armored Destrier, an ideal card for LoFaramir to take advantage of his trap-enhanced *attack*.  But there's no way to put ABB, Gondorian Shield, and Armored Destrier together anymore.\n\nIn Grima meets Dori (unpublished) LoDenethor is the target along with Gondorian Shield -- once again, this was put together before Armored Destrier, which LoDenethor would absolutely want -- he wants to be ready post-defense, not only for another defense if necessary, but to use his ability.\n\nThe restricted hits hard, very hard -- my favorite ally target for ABB was Wellinghall Preserver -- decent defense, good hp, self-healing.  Freed from shadow concerns they can block some minor enemies.  No more.\n\nThis is, by far, the most popular card ever errataed, and both changes to it are major; but I think the restricted hurts more.  And the errata *cannot* be justified as being part of a broken combo.  This is straight up the designers saying \"Wouldn't it be great if Carn Dum were even harder to beat?\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3696304","commentId":3696304,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1557076619,"content":"By far the most popular?

There would be comparisons to Armored Destrier—pluses and minuses, people would say it's weaker, others would counter that it was a good option for Lore, etc.—but overall no one would call it a coaster.\n\nI certainly agree with you -- and in fact, it would be highly praised, because (absent ABB) all that you have in Lore to aid defense is Protector of Lorien (which costs cards), Dark Knowledge (which isn't much help) and Cloak of Lorien (restricted to elves).  Lore has heroes with good defensive bones and healing, but *absent* shadow protection the best defender in the core set (Denethor) or the best (conditional) defense in Lore (Rossiel) isn't going to live to be healed, having only 3 hp.\n\nNow if ABB hadn't existed, maybe in the many cycles there would be more lore cards that help out hero defense along the way, and this new ABB would be seen as a big thing, the great attachment that *finally* vaults Lore defense into top tier.  But that's not what happened -- Lore had ABB, ABB was fantastic, it didn't get anything else along the way.  You can, I think, fairly argue that a weaker ABB way back in the Mirkwood cycle might have changed other cards released along the way -- certainly that argument has been made for Steward of Gondor enough times.  But all those subsequent cards have already been released, and undoing an early \"design mistake\" doesn't change the fact that the subsequent quests and cards were designed in the context of the *original* card, and the more powerful the original card, the greater than influence is.  Carn Dum was *designed* knowing that ABB could ignore a whole stack of shadows, the errata has made that impossible.  Rossiel was *designed* knowing that ABB could completely protect her fragile body from shadows -- now it's partial.  Treebeard was *designed* knowing that ABB could make the high-threat hero one of the best defenders of the game, at the expense of not using his damage-enhanced willpower or attack -- now the self-injuring hero is completely vulnerable to shadows because he can't have ABB at all.  In short, even if an early game \"design mistake\" has affected subsequent development, undoing the \"mistake\" does nothing to change subsequent development -- unless you start doing positive errata, and that just doesn't happen.\n\nAside from taking both restricted spots, Armored Destrier works exceptionally well with the new ABB, since it can remove the shadow from a second defense while ABB protects against the first.  The downside is that it requires songs or sentinel-granting to get both on the same hero, except for Lore Aragorn.  Since Armored Destrier can't remove the *first* shadow, it's not really in competition with ABB.  Staff of Lebethron is more of a direct competitor, and was already the superior card for some quests, though it's certainly more narrow.\n\nI think the big winners in a multiplayer environment are likely to be Balin and Erkenbrand.\n\nBut any evaluation of errata should not just be limited to before/after -- the cost should also be taken into account.  *Any* errata imposes a cost by virtue of having cards not actually have the effect printed on them, this has been used to argue against the idea of positive errata for coasters, despite the expansion of the effective card pool that follows.  But when a card is not a coaster but a widely-used card, this effect is much, much larger.  ABB is in over 1500 published decks at ringsdb, and as an early card ABB has had much attention and study, along with recommendations to new players -- all of that is now obsolete.  The nerf to ABB is better than the nerf to Horn of Gondor (for example) in that its essential function hasn't changed and the \"common case\" of a single attack with a single shadow is exactly the same (at least if you can spare the restricted spot).  But that doesn't change the fact that hundreds of decks just got weaker, *without* any broken combo to require an errata.\n\nAbsent other cards and a handful of quests, ABB still is \"repeatedly eliminating drama that is supposed to be intrinsic to the framework\", because no Lore characters self-ready or defend without exhausting -- ABB still provides *complete* protection against a single shadow from a single attack.  It's certainly true that you can load up a hero with song of wisdom (if not lore), ABB, a host of readying effects and defensive attachments and repeatedly eliminate the \"drama\" of shadows against many attacks -- but now we are talking about the combination of *many* cards and much deck space to set up that scenario, a large investment in intentionally eliminating the drama.  And who suffers?  The person who did it?  No -- they did that *on purpose*, and were exposed to the intrinsic drama repeatedly while getting set up.  The other players watching the defender?  Possible, but making Beregond (non-Lore) more vulnerable to shadows won't stop him from taking as many defenses as possible, because that's what he's designed for and that's all he's good at doing.  (He's also less vulnerable to shadows because he starts with the highest def/hp, and exists in spheres with shadow protection events).  I was rather under the impression that meetup players *liked* having a player provide sentinel defense and would not be pleased for sentinel heroes to die more often -- perhaps that's not the case.\n\nI think it's worth protecting other players -- but I don't think it's worth protecting the *encounter deck*, which has no feelings to be hurt.  I don't want to see the designers nerfing cards just for the purpose of making the game harder, but that appears to be exactly the motivation for this particular change."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3696574","commentId":3696574,"userName":"Wandalf the

It *was* (part of) one method of making the game a lot easier and, notably, less interesting by removing the aforementioned drama - the game is designed on the assumption that shadow effects are something the players will have to deal with to some extent, and Burning Brand on the right target made it too easy to just excise that entire aspect of the game.\n> \n> To my mind, this Burning Brand errata is actually the perfect kind of errata, in that it blocks the broken case while leaving the common case untouched, as you yourself noted. From my own personal perspective it also rehabilitates the card to the point where as mentioned, I'm now much more likely to play it myself.\n\n1) I said Staff was better in certain quests, and it is.  In Wastes of Eriador you can't cancel shadows at night -- but you can discard.  In the Lonely Mountain, reattacks can be triggered by shadows even if you have ABB -- but not if you discard them (and due to Smaug's high threat, you can *always* discard).  In Road to Isengard shadows to Saruman can do their wizardy effects even if you have ABB -- but not if you discard them (and due to Saruman's high threat, you can *always* discard).  And for Mountain Warg's you can keep them engaged by discarding their shadow.\n\nStaff was just as good as the old-ABB in the case where you need to take exactly one attack from a high-threat enemy each turn (there are a number of quests like this), if you can afford the restricted spot.  Now it's better in that situation, because it's cheaper.  The new-ABB has lost some of its important advantages over Staff, but still retains some -- doesn't have to exhaust in advance of knowing the shadow, works against enemies of all threat levels.  But it's still much worse for Lonely Mountain.\n\n2) The decks are only weakened, but the commentary is obsolete.  We had not along ago a fresh in-depth description posted by Silblade of the Conflict at the Carrock player cards.  He quite rightly raved about ABB, gave it six stars out of five, and compared it to SoG, Test of Will, Unexpected Courage, and Feint (one of these things is not like the others, IMO).  Obsolete.\n\nThe decks aren't obsolete, but they are published -- they are fixed, and no longer work like they did when designed.  This is a significant cost to errata.  Could those decks be tweaked to remove restricted attachments no longer fitting, and/or include additional shadow protection to cover for ABB's weakness.  Sure.  They could also be tweaked to think that SoW/ABB is no longer worth the work and substitute different shadow protection instead.  They could even be reworked to abandon hero defense entirely.  You're welcome to rejoice in all that future deckbuilding in light of the revised ABB, but for me I mourn for all the work *already done* that has been affected, including some of my own unpublished decks.  All to fix a problem that *wasn't* a problem to me.\n\n3) Because I don't think being able to negate shadow cards *constitutes a broken combo*.  I see broken combos as something that *actually guarantees* victory, like the infinite resource/card combos that involved since-errataed cards like Master of Lore, Love of Tales, We Are Not Idle, and Horn of Gondor.  You've seen it before, Seastan posts a ridiculously powerful and uninteresting to play deck, and the next FAQ that comes along breaks one or more of the components to keep it from happening again.  This is worlds away from an effect that has been in place for *years* and was both widely used and widely enjoyed.  Stacking ABB with readying only gives you a finite number of shadow-free defenses, bounded by your readying, and merely makes defense predictable, as attack already is and questing can be in the presence of scrying.  Do you propose a limit on Erkenbrand's ability?  Do you consider the option given in the game rules to play without shadows at all \"broken\"?\n\n4) I'll have to take your word that \"any quest in the game can be reliably be beaten\" without ABB, because I certainly don't reliably beat all the quests in the game even *with* ABB.  I don't rember *ever* beating Carn Dum without ABB, which is particularly shadow-heavy.  But I also don't make hyper-efficient decks a priority.  Yes, in my Dori fellowships I will sometimes go to lengths to get ABB on a heroic defender, since Dori *requires* a heroic defender to take advantage of his ability, but I know full well that I could make the game easier by not bothering with Dori and trying to turn a 2 defense or 3 hp hero into a Beregondish defender, instead just using the original article from the get-go.  That's *my* choice -- I'm OK with self-inflicted difficulty increases on the way to a shadow-free super defender.  I'm less pleased with the designers taking away my end-state, not to protect *other players* in a pick-up game, but to protect the integrity of the encounter deck after all these years.  They're taking away something I liked.  I appreciate that you didn't like it, and you didn't play it, so it expands your pool -- but is it worth the cost to others?\n\nI agree that as errata goes, ABB *does* preserve the common case, and in that respect it's a better errata than what was done to the poor Horn of Gondor.  And the end result is a viable card, unlike poor Master of Lore.  But I don't agree that the uncommon case was \"broken\" instead of just not to your taste.  If the designers want to errata cards to address power level, I would prefer they target little-used cards to expand *everyone's* pool, not just nerf widely-used cards to make them more attractive to the few who consider them too powerful.  I'm not holding my breath."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3696704","commentId":3696704,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1557163214,"content":">

Targeting ABB is one way to bring that archetype more into balance.\n\nI don't see using Path of Need to clear the field of enemies as \"abuse\", I see that as its intended purpose.  It's a 4-cost 1-per-deck, and is meant to be game changing.  The same applies to non-exhausting defense on the expensive events Light the Beacons and Hour of Wrath (which thanks to the Hama nerf can only be played nine times in a row).  I *especially* don't see Path of Need as abuse in multiplayer when *everyone* cooperates to avoid overquesting to build up their build state.  It's a co-operative game.  I understand the need for errata where a *single deck* can force a win or monopolize combat in a multiplayer situation.  But when *all* players at the table cooperate to keep Path of Need in play to clear the board of enemies, that's what they've *chosen* to do and it's simply not a problem that needs to be fixed.  And *no* solo \"abuse\" needs to be fixed at all.\n\nThe same is true of Beregond's normal action in a four player game, where the players cooperate to get Beregond set up for shadow-free defense with plenty of readies -- if they cooperate to do that, so what?  Beregond + 4x Unexpected Courage + Song of Wisdom + Gondorian Shield + A Burning Brand is an eight card combo involving three spheres and four copies of a single card, a single deck isn't going to make Beregond bulletproof by itself (nor would it necessarily be unwelcome -- isn't bringing Beregond to the table what you *want* your friend to do in multiplayer?).\n\nAnd what are we bringing the superdefender Beregond more into balance *with*?  Yes, it raises the difficulty level, but that by itself is not intrinsically good.  But compared to other defending heroes, with the obvious exception of Beorn and Erkenbrand, the ABB nerf will bother Beregond *less* than any other hero -- he can get to 6/5 sentinel with a single cheap/free attachment, leaving a restricted slot free that other heroes need to get anywhere near Beregond's lofty stats.  He's also not native Lore, so weakening ABB weakens Lore defenders relative to Beregond.  Beregond will be fine, and in a 4-player game will require little supplemental shadow cancellation and healing to survive handling multiple defenses per turn, even with the change to ABB.  Meanwhile, Fastred can no longer do Raiment of War/ABB *at all* in my two-deck fellowship, and he will die from ordinary common-case defense.  Was making Super Beregond slightly more fragile so important than Fastred deserved this?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3697117","commentId":3697117,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1557236606,"content":"> 59 minutes ago, Boromore said:\n> \n> [...]To me, I think ABB was a combo - almost in itself.

It's ABB. I picked Beregond as an example because I happen to see him abuse it the most. But lore Denethor could be used too - he's only 1 less starting defense, but he's got the trait match for Gondorian Shield and is in-sphere for ABB. Lore Bilbo was another culprit due to Fast Hitch. The problematic combo is not Beregond+ABB, it's readying+ABB. And out of those two options, nerfing ABB is way cleaner and easier with less far-reaching consequences.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> The last time I beat Carn Dum\n\nCarn Dum's \"thing\" is its shadow effects, so it makes sense that nerfing ABB would have the biggest impact against this quest.

Spirit has plenty of in-sphere shadow cancellation. Tactics has some too. Trying to shoehorn ABB onto Fastred with a Song of Wisdom would slow my deck down quite a bit and probably make it worse.

Who knows, maybe your dependence on ABB has made you overlook some more efficient options, and your decks will actually improve as a result of the errata.\n\nI've never thought of Fastred as an archetype, let alone top tier, just as Dunhere and LeEomer's best friend.  I've played Fastred without ABB/Raiment of War -- I did use Raiment of War in my mono-spirit Dunhere/SpBard/Fastred deck for the solo September league, and that was a lot of fun, thanks to SpBard I could use Raiment of War and Hauberk of Mail, with the Mirkwood shadows and Hasty Stroke that was sufficient for me (non-nightmare).  But my Black Serpent fellowship (using all cards from that AP) used both, and my not-yet played Dori, Side-Quests and LeEomer relies on both cards for Fastred.  He's only 3/3, he needs Raiment of War just to get where Beregond *starts*, and Rohan's defensive Golden Shield is strictly inferior to Gondorian Shield for Fastred.  It always annoys me when erratas damage a deck/fellowship before I get around to playing it, and since I have so many decks in that state it's almost inevitable it will happen.\n\nSpirit has a lot of shadow cancellation events, Hasty Stroke being the most important (and given my fondness for hero defense, I'm leaning towards Hasty Stroke being more important than A Test of Will).  But I prefer repeatable effects to one-time effects.  Forcing me to abandon the deck I *want* to play via errata is a cost *even if* I change the deck to being more efficient.  My decks aren't usually optimal in the first place."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3698290","commentId":3698290,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1557366468,"content":"> On 5/7/2019 at 2:06 PM, Seastan said:\n> \n> II have watched multiple decklists from myself and others get Beregond loaded up with ABB and enough readies to handle defense for all players all by itself in short order.

Beregond will still be the dominant defender in the game, and with his 4 base defense it seems he was designed to be. I'm not arguing that the errata will equalize the defender playing field. I'm arguing that it will make the whole \"defend everything on the table with one character\" strategy weaker.\n\nIt's true that Beregond tends to shrug off +X attack shadow effects, but many (the majority of?) shadow effects are not that simple. Here's a list of shadow effects from a recent scenario, The King's Quest:\n\n1. Shadow: Attacking enemy makes an additional attack against you after this one.\n2. Shadow: Discard an attachment you control.\n3. Shadow: Deal 1 damage to the defending character.\n4. Shadow: Defending character cannot ready until the end of the round.\n5. Shadow: Attacking enemy gets +1 Attack.\n6. Shadow: If this attack is undefended, discard an ally you control.\n \nBeregond only shrugs off 5 and 6 (and maybe 3 if you've got healing out). And given that 4 could mean an instant loss if you are counting on Beregond defending for the table, you need to save ABB for that one and accept every instance of 1, 2, and 3.\nEdited May 9, 2019 by Seastan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3698351","commentId":3698351,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1557376689,"content":"> 3 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> With that said, I would greatly prefer that cards deemed unbalancing for competitive one-deck be handled with a Restricted list for that format rather than spoiling the fun for everyone with an errata.\n\nThat's sort of what they're doing.

It feels almost like you are cheating. And if you are playing in things like the solo league then you feel dishonest playing it that way. And it's similar and even worse if it's an unprinted change.\n\nIn another game, X-Wing, which my wife and I used to play before this game, my wife's favorite build was Palpatine in a Shuttle with two wingman. She played it dozens of times against me. And we almost always played just the two of us. Beat me many times and I beat her a few back. But she was still getting into the heavier games at that time. \n\nThen one year they nerfed Palpatine and changed his effect to be \"more balanced\", we could still play the old way and we tried to but it ruined it for her and she eventually lost interest in the game. It felt like we were cheating or playing it wrong or making up your own rules to make it easier. And destroyed her favourite squad while at it.\n\nThis has the same effect on us. My favourite character is Boromir and when I read they changed his to once per phase I felt similar and he became less fun for me because I felt like I was again making up my own rules. We didn't and still don't have even half of the card pool so threat reduction isn't really possible so he wasn't abused. And even if I had everything and could make him raise his threat forever and the game gets too easy then I just change it up and play something else, it's a cooperative friendly game. But still when I play him now either I'm looking at his card and mentally attaching restrictions to him which is lame. Or I'm playing him with my \"made-up\" rules of no limit and feel bad. Kind of ruined the entire card for me. \n\n \n\nSo do we keep playing him the old way? Sure but it's definitley become less fun using him and I feel like I have to play him a different way if I want to be legit. So = less fun to do as you said and be statement 1.\n\n \n\nI don't want my wife and friends to lose interest in a game as their favorite combos are altered. That's not enjoyable to any of us and actually detracts from and ruins parts of the game because it's more to keep track of and you feel bad when you play it the old way.\n\n \n\nAlso how many erratas do you really want? If they changed every single card in the game would that actually be ideal? How is one supposed to keep track of all of that and wouldn't you feel bad if you won with a certain card or cards and afterwards realized/remembered it doesn't play like it has been changed to? I know we would.\n\n \n\nWhat would be far far better in our opinion is just coming out with OPTIONAL restricted card pool/hero lists or specific erratas for an event. It lets guys that for some reason need help balancing a cooperative game be able to have alternate worse cards. And keeps things simpler and more fun for the casual players like us that help grow the gamer base instead of getting overwhelmed with extra text to remember or have to feel bad because we aren't playing it right, or not come out to larger events because the way we play is different then the way it's supposed to be now. \n\n \n\nEither way we reject erratas on player cards and hope they stop with them or change it to optional perhaps rotating lists and leave our physical cards and games alone. And we'll keep playing the old way while trying to not become disenfranchised with the game because of these changes.\n\nEdited May 13, 2019 by GILLIES291"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3700726","commentId":3700726,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1557726133,"content":"> 8 hours ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> Statement 1: A player that dislikes an errata and plays without it suffers no harm to their enjoyment.\n> \n> Statement 2: A player that likes an errata and chooses to use it receives a benefit to their enjoyment.\n> \n> Support for Statement 1: This is a co-op game, and as such no one is forcing anyone to play a particular way.*\n> \n> Support for Statement 2: True by definition.\n> \n>  \n> \n> By the above, I conclude that errata has at worst a neutral effect, and at best a positive effect.

Errata do have a kind of psychic cost to them. (But I'd say that the contribution of errata to misbegotten wins is pretty minimal, compared to the hairball of rules that make up this game at this point, heh)\n\nI guess I subscribe to an auteur perspective on this game: I want to play the game that the designer intends, since Caleb, though imperfect like all of us humans, has almost always earned my trust in him. He shapes the game with every new release—essentially all of us (who are not playtesters) have no idea what ends up on the cutting room floor, after all.

But the bigger problem is, that there are so many translation errors in the older cycles of German version, especially in Heirs of Númenor, that you would never be able to play the game properly without knowing. E.g. Ithilien Road reduces the attack value to zero instead of the engagement cost, this totally alters the quest and makes the first rounds trivial in Into Ithilien. And there are a lot of similar errors."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3701100","commentId":3701100,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1557773235,"content":"> 14 hours ago, GILLIES291 said:\n> \n>  \n\nYou have some good points here regarding Statement 1.\n\nFrom my understanding, the main counterargument is this kind of \"guilt\" you feel if you play a card that has been errata'd the original way. And I sympathize with this. By nerfing a card, the designers have deemed it too powerful, so by playing with the original text makes it seem like you are playing on easy mode.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings or anyone else's. You feel the way you feel. But maybe I can help by framing errata a bit differently.\n\nI would suggest rather to interpret errata this way: That the designers have deemed the card too powerful given the current state of the card pool, going forward. You should feel 0 guilt playing with original text against any of the previous 100 quests that have come out so far. Why? Because they let the card stand as is for all those years. If they made the past quests too easy, they would have errata'd it long before. By waiting until now to do it, they are effectively saying that the rest of the card pool is developed to the point where we have so many readying effects, with likely many more to come, that A Burning Brand can be too easily abused.\n\nThousands of players have been playing the original text of A Burining Brand against the current collection of quests for years. The errata doesn't invalidate any of those wins any more than an errata in a competitive game invalidates the last year's tournament champion who happened to use the card. If players want to copy the old championship decklists in a competitive game and play them against each other, one could argue that they should in fact use the original text rather than the ettata'd text. Why not apply the same logic to old quests?\n\nNow yes, the cards are going to be reprinted with the updated text. They need to be, because the game is still alive, and future content is going to be balanced around the errata'd text. For a new player entering the game, picking up both old content and new, it would be a negative experience for them to complete some new content only to realize they were playing incorrectly because they did not have the updated text. I honestly think this would be a worse feeling for a new player than the slightly increased difficulty in not having the original Burning Brand when playing old scenarios.\n\nSo I really feel that nobody should feel any guilt at all when playing old content with the original text.\n\nAs for future content, you might say that your enjoyment of those scenarios will not be as high as it would have been, because you will feel guilty about playing with the original text. That's fair. I would feel guilty too. But keep in mind there would be nothing to prevent a designer from loading up every quest insert with a bunch of extra rules to counter all the overpowered decks. Errata is simply a lot cleaner way of ensuring that their new scenarios don't get immediately stomped. We saw this when the Boromir deck rose to power and the designers countered with new scenarios all having shadow effects that prevented the defender from readying (which ended up harming other archetypes even more). Then Boromir was ettata'd, and now hopefully we will start seeing these effects die out.\n\nNow, future content does not exist yet. So it's not possible for our enjoyment of it to go down from where it currently stands. This is where Statement 1 is coming from. If you won't find enjoyment from new content when playing either version of ABB, you are free to avoid purchasing it. The designers do not owe us new content that can be well handled by ABB. They don't owe us anything at all.\n\nNevertheless, despite having these discussions every time a new FAQ is published, many of them containing plenty of errata that I myself wish was done differently, it's easy for me to say that the game is in the best state it's ever been, and my enjoyment continues to go up every year. Boromir was my favorite card in the game. But I'm now enjoying newer cards more than I ever did Boromir. It's a living card game. Let it live."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3701417","commentId":3701417,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1557813737,"content":"I appreciate you taking the time to explain it a different way.

You couldn't have nerfs to long-released cards early in the game life, because it was early in the game's life. But anyway, I'll grant whatever point you're trying to make here because I don't think it matters. \"The developers have never done X before, so they should not do X now\" is not a convincing argument, in my view.\n\nThe time that elapses between release and errata impacts the cost of errata.  But it's got me curious about how long has elapsed for errata over history.  Unfortunately the pre-errata text is not given, so some of my descriptions may be off.\n\n4/20/2011 core released\n\nFAQ 1.1 (6/24/2011) -- no player cards\n\nFAQ 1.2 (10/28/2011) -- no player cards\n\n11/20/2011 Dead Marshes released\n\n1/6/2012 Khazad Dum released\n\n3/12/2012 Road to Rivendell released\n\n5/16/2012 Long Dark released\n\nFAQ 1.3 (8/1/2012)\n\nBeravor (core) -- once per round\n\nProtector of Lorien (core) -- capped at 3.\n\nZigil Miner (KD) -- only 1 resource per match\n\nThis is the first errata, and these can all be considered \"power nerfs\".  Beravor/Protector had been around for a bit over a year, but this is the first FAQ after the release of Zigil Miner.  Beravor/Protector both preserve the common case.\n\n8/8/2012 Shadow and Flame released\n\n8/17/2012 OHUH released\n\n11/26/2012 HoN released\n\n2/22/2013 OtDS released\n\nFAQ 1.4 (2/27/2013)\n\nFeint (core) -- protect one player\n\nThicket of Spears (core) -- protect one player?\n\nNarvi's Belt (KD) -- not sure what changed here.  Exhaustion?  Phase instead of round?\n\nOut of Sight (Long Dark) -- protect one player?\n\nNori (OHUH) -- add from your hand?\n\nThror's Map (OHUH) -- make Travel Action.\n\nMaster of Lore (HoN) -- only discounts one card\n\nThis FAQ is the first since Shadow and Flame, which I think prompted the changes to the two core cards.  Master of Lore was victimized by an extreme combo and was poorly done IMO.  This was the first chance to fix Nori/Thror's Map, both of which affected power though Thror's Map was *extremely* powerful in its original form.\n\n5/31/2013 Druadan Forest released\n\nFAQ 1.5 (7/26/2013?)\n\nRavens of the Mountains (OTDS) -- look at instead of \"reveal\" (positive errata)\n\nOTDS was released so close to the last FAQ that this is probably the first chance to fix what was an unusable card.\n\nOctober 2013 Blood of Gondor released\n\nFAQ 1.6 (2/6/2014)\n\nErebor Battle Master (Long Dark) -- +1 attack per ally\n\nExpert Treasure Hunter (OtDS) -- limit 1 per hero\n\nThese can both be looked at power nerfs, especially for EBM.  ETH had been out for close to a year, EBM for over 20 months.\n\nJune 2014 Dunland Trap released\n\nOctober 2014 Nin-in-Eleph released\n\nFAQ 1.7 (1/20/2015)\n\nWill of the West (Core) -- remove from game when used\n\nO Elbereth Gilthoniel (Shadow and Flame) -- title fixed\n\nA Watchful Peace (HoN) -- ??\n\nTrained for War (Druadan Forest) -- ??\n\nBlue Mountain Trader (Dunland Trap) -- limit once per round\n\nWill of the West was part of an extreme combo and the change preserved the common case.  This was the first chance to fix Blue Mountain Trader, and the change preserved the common case.  I don't remember the original form for the other three, but I don't remember them generating discussion.\n\nFAQ 1.8 (1/26/2016)\n\nHorn of Gondor (Core) -- character destroyed instead of leaves play\n\nLove of Tales (Long Dark) -- make exhaust, restricted\n\nBoth cards were part of an extreme combo, and Love of Tales preserved the common case.  Horn of Gondor changed *the common case* instead of exhausting and IMO a very poorly down errata.  Horn of Gondor had been out over four years.\n\nFAQ 1.9 (10/16/2017)\n\nWandering Took (core) -- limit once per round\n\nBoromir (Dead Marshes) -- ability limited to once per phase\n\nOut of the Wild (Road to Rivendell) -- add to victory display\n\nHama (Long Dark) -- ability limited to three times per game for group\n\nWe Are Not Idle (Shadow and Flame) -- exhaust heroes instead of dwarves\n\nCaldara (Blood of Gondor) -- ability limited to once per game\n\nWingfoot (Nin-in-Eleph) -- exhaust\n\nWandering Took, WANI, Out of the Wild, Wingfoot were all part of extreme combos, all changes preserved the common case except for WANI, which was dramatically weakened after over five years in wide use.\n\nHama was part of a combo with Thicket of Spears, which was errated over four years ago (with Feint) so that Hama could continue to use it without breaking multiplayer.  Hama had been out for over five years.\n\nCaldara had been out for four years, but had more recently become popular because of a couple new cards (one specifically designed to work well with Caldara) and a favorable ruling.  It was a straight power nerf and changed her archtype.\n\nBoromir had been out for almost six years and was very popular, and it was a straight power nerf.\n\nFAQ 1.10 (2019)\n\nA Burning Brand, Legacy of Durin, Erebor Battle Master, who knows what else.  Legacy of Durin has been involved in previous extreme combos, the other two not.\n\nPoor Long Dark, receiving errata in five different FAQs.\n\nIt's true that you couldn't nerf \"long-released cards\" early in the game because nothing had been out long, but it's striking that *only* long-released cards are receiving errata.  Blue Mountain Trader appears to be the *only* card after 2013 to be fixed in the next available FAQ.  Beravor was errata-ed in the *first* FAQ that errata-ed player cards, that's not the same sort of thing that was done to Boromir."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3701599","commentId":3701599,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1557843579,"content":">

In summary, playing with original text against any scenario released before the errata should not really be considered \"against the rules\", since it was allowed at the time. It should only be considered against the rules for future content. But in that case, it is up to the individual to decide if they will get enjoyment out of it. If they decide to stop collecting more content and just play with what they have, then their enjoyment hasn't gone down.\n\nAnd yes, I believe everyone in the thread saying that it still will. I am trying to help them reconsider. Just as a thought experiment, suppose the developers themselves came out and said \"When playing progression style, feel free to use the original text of a card for quests released before that card's errata.\" If they said this, then would you agree with me that errata should cause no loss of enjoyment for anyone?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3701748","commentId":3701748,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1557857720,"content":"Errata by its very nature will often cause someone to lose enjoyment. It's changing the rules, dethroning common favourite cards, and presenting the option to either play with our own made up rules (which we see as the old and original way) or lose out on favorite heroes and key player cards. \n\nSure I could use heroes other than Boromir, and I have. But he is my favourite hero and thematically raising your threat to try to help multiple times in a round was always great fun. Then when I found out he had been changed it dimminished and spoiled a lot of that fun. For those of us that want to play by the rules and updates, it's hard when thing we enjoy get the nerf bat. Especially when often it's because one player just made a super powerful combo and was abusing it and publicizing it. You can break a lot of heroes and cards in the current game with the right set ups. But now it almost makes you not want to publish powerful and interesting new decks for fear that your design will inspire a future errata. \n\nAnd it all boils back down to a cooperative versus a competitive game. Comepetive games needs it more because of large group events and LOTR is recently been straddling the line especially with the latest POD packs being versus ones. Which is why I think those events or scenarios would benefit from a banned list rather than physically altering the vast majority of everyone else's games and enjoyment.\n\nSo you can't please everyone and erratas targeting old cards, when most of us New players only have a few and older cards, really just ramps up the difficulty and hurts our gameplay. Yes I know you said we shouldn't feel bad playing by the old way, but we do. And newer players that buy a new pack will have no choice but to play vastly underpowered versions of those cards.\n\n \n\nI can say that the Horn of Gondor errata made trying to play a pure tactics fellowship with just the core set that much harder. My first adventure pack I picked up was Dead Marshes to get Boromir and thankfully I didn't know about his errata and the version I have doesn't have those changes so I was able to enjoy the fighting chance he gave my tactics groups with the limited card pool against difficult scenarios. Same with Hama who was just being a fun option that is difficult to abuse going to \"well he is pretty much garbage now, it's not like he could really do anything other than getting feint or eagle searching back\". Caldera doesn't actually make sense for us to play even written the old way because we hardly have any high cost spirit allies, limiting her to once per game just made us laugh and put her in the will never play anytime soon pile. Which is unfortunate. So those three heroes are borderline unusable to us average new players unless you had tons of adventure packs and could try to build something still semi-good but limited and specific."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3701766","commentId":3701766,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1557859360,"content":"> 23 minutes ago, GILLIES291 said:\n> \n> I can say that the Horn of Gondor errata made trying to play a pure tactics fellowship with just the core set that much harder.\n\nWhat do you mean with that?

I wonder why Hobbit-sense has not gotten an errata yet as it also prevent enemies from attacking. Narvi's Belt could be used to generate Baggins ressources as rees263 already pointed out. Nori reduced your threat after a dwarf character entered play under your control. Combine this with Sneak Attack or A very good Tale und you got some crazy threat reduction. I am not familiar with the old combo of Master of Lore, so I cannot comment this card. Maybe you can explain it to me.\n\n> Quote\n> \n>  \n> \n> A Watchful Peace (HoN) -- ??\n> \n> Trained for War (Druadan Forest) -- ??\n> \n> Blue Mountain Trader (Dunland Trap) -- limit once per round\n> \n> Will of the West was part of an extreme combo and the change preserved the common case.  This was the first chance to fix Blue Mountain Trader, and the change preserved the common case.  I don't remember the original form for the other three, but I don't remember them generating discussion.\n> \n>  \n\nA Watchful peace allowed to bring a location back to the encounter deck that had victory points, potentially abusing some cards. Trained for War was changed so it could be used on quests that had key-words other than Siege like Dire or Defense. Blue Mountain Trader allowed free ressource trading between players (and heroes of different spheres) thus trivializing the planning phase. Imagine like A Good Harvest in ally form for all players.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Horn of Gondor (Core) -- character destroyed instead of leaves play\n> \n> Love of Tales (Long Dark) -- make exhaust, restricted\n> \n> Both cards were part of an extreme combo, and Love of Tales preserved the common case.  Horn of Gondor changed *the common case* instead of exhausting and IMO a very poorly down errata.  Horn of Gondor had been out over four years.\n\nLove of Tales is limited once per hero instead of restricted, but you surely meant that. Sure, you can no longer generate three ressourcs on a single hero when playing a song, most of which can be paid by any hero. I never tried this combo, so I cannot say, whether it was extreme or not.\n\nI never had a problem with the Errata for Horn of Gondor, seeing as it was intended to fascilitate chump blocking. This way it would no longer combo with the silvan events, which it was not designed for as this was too powerful. Normally by chumping you sacrifice an ally to save a hero, silvan events only give you benefits from the event itself and replaying the returned ally. Seeing that most silvans only cost 2 ressources, HoG paid for half your cards already.\nIt also no longer synergizes with Sneak Attack, which used to be clearly intented by the developers (look at some older news, back when they still wrote other articles that just announcements), but in my opinion this is not bad. After all Boromir used his horn when he was in dire need and not because Legolas went scouting into the woods.\n\n> Quote\n> \n>  \n> \n> Wandering Took (core) -- limit once per round\n> \n> Boromir (Dead Marshes) -- ability limited to once per phase\n> \n> Out of the Wild (Road to Rivendell) -- add to victory display\n> \n> Hama (Long Dark) -- ability limited to three times per game for group\n> \n> We Are Not Idle (Shadow and Flame) -- exhaust heroes instead of dwarves\n> \n> Caldara (Blood of Gondor) -- ability limited to once per game\n> \n> Wingfoot (Nin-in-Eleph) -- exhaust\n> \n> Wandering Took, WANI, Out of the Wild, Wingfoot were all part of extreme combos, all changes preserved the common case except for WANI, which was dramatically weakened after over five years in wide use.\n> \n> Hama was part of a combo with Thicket of Spears, which was errated over four years ago (with Feint) so that Hama could continue to use it without breaking multiplayer.  Hama had been out for over five years.\n> \n> Caldara had been out for four years, but had more recently become popular because of a couple new cards (one specifically designed to work well with Caldara) and a favorable ruling.  It was a straight power nerf and changed her archtype.\n> \n> Boromir had been out for almost six years and was very popular, and it was a straight power nerf.\n> \n>  \n\nWANI was a power nerf, but a needed one, as generating a dozen ressources with a single card (and potential readying with Lure of Moria) is just plain overpowered. Traffic from Dale is a similar card, but at least it is limited to once per round and having allies with attachments is more difficult to achieve than spamming dwarves.\n\nHáma and Thicket of Spears just trivialized combat for a single player, as you no longer needed to defend non-immune enemies. You just engaged everything and let them rot. I cannot say whether this was the best way to nerf the situation but at least it no longer restricted Caleb in the invention of new tactics events. Not even spirit can play a single event for the rest of the game.\n\n> Quote\n> \n>  \n> \n> A Burning Brand, Legacy of Durin, Erebor Battle Master, who knows what else.  Legacy of Durin has been involved in previous extreme combos, the other two not.\n> \n> Poor Long Dark, receiving errata in five different FAQs.\n> \n> It's true that you couldn't nerf \"long-released cards\" early in the game because nothing had been out long, but it's striking that *only* long-released cards are receiving errata.  Blue Mountain Trader appears to be the *only* card after 2013 to be fixed in the next available FAQ.  Beravor was errata-ed in the *first* FAQ that errata-ed player cards, that's not the same sort of thing that was done to Boromir.\n> \n>  \n\nI am fine with errata to Legacy of Durin and Erebor Battle Master. Five attack for a single ally (with Dáin) is enough, I see no justification why a dwarf should be able to one-hit everything in the game. Granted you need some work to achieve such a power level, but it is not as if you had to exhaust all other dwarves to use his ability or something. The nerf to Legacy is similar to the one of Nori.\n\nBurning Brand again is one of those cards trivializing the game, which I should be fine with nerfing, though I will have to adjust my deck-building and approach on shadow effects. I wonder why Elrond or Warden of Healing have not received an errata.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3701825","commentId":3701825,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1557863193,"content":"> 35 minutes ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> There's also Gandalf in the core set that can trigger it, and when the tactics deck is in a fellowship the other deck might have Sneak Attack.\n> \n> The real hit from the Horn change comes right away in the Mirkwood cycle when the Eagles come online -- they're expensive and they leave play by design.  Mirkwood also introduces Rohan's discard mechanic, if tactics is playing with spirit.  Progression style, Mirkwood was probably peak Horn of Gondor usefulness until Silvan becomes a thing.\n\nWell, Gillie mentioned core set only, so Eagles and Rohirrim would not count, though I somehow forgot about Gandalf, who is similar to Beorn.

While some cards may be rather dependent on the card pool you have available, that's the case whatever their errata status, so let's disregard that for the moment. The only errata'd card I might consider underpowered following its errata is Master of Lore, and even then not 'vastly' so. This is the thing that annoys me most when people start complaining about errata - a lot of the time they seem to only consider the card in relation to its pre-errata state rather than to other cards in the pool, the actually reasonable means of assessing whether something is over- or underpowered. Which again, they're not underpowered, certainly not vastly so."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3702355","commentId":3702355,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1557933361,"content":"> 15 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Winged Guardian is expensive *because* you have to keep feeding it.  I saved a lot of resources (progression) when I was able to replace Winged Guardian with Defender of Rammas.  Vassal is cheap but temporary.  And yes, it's nice when they go away and buff Eagles of the Misty Mountains (cost 4), and when you get down your Support of the Eagles (cost 3).  And you can also play Descendant of Thorondor (cost 4) and Landroval (cost 5). \n\nAs soon as you pay to keep Winged Guardian around, Horn of Gondor is not helping you and never did, so the errata changed nothing in that regard. If the Guardian is destroyed, you will still get the ressource. The only difference is, that you no longer get a ressource when you choose not to satisfy the forced effect, but in that case, why were you using the Guardian instead of a chump`? And Support of the Eagles even lets you use the Guardian like an attachment, so no extra cost for keeping him around at all.\nLandroval is expensive, yes, but compared to Fate or Fortune, which costs the same with a similar effect, you also get a decent ally. I have already mentioned,\n\n> Quote\n> \n> that spirit could really use some extra ressources when discarding all those Rohan allies, and Lore allies tend to become more expensive\n\nbut some of you chose to ignore that part of my sentence completely. I can see a certain habit in these times, where quotes are cited without context to create a straw man.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> But don't worry about those high costs, because ally Radagast (cost 5) will help you pay for it.\n\nWhile Radagast himself is expensive, he also provides 2 willpower, which in that card pool is worth about 2 - 3 ressources, particularly in tactics, where Eagles of the Misty Mountains are the best, when it comes to questing with 2 willpower. If you want more willpower, use a different sphere. So you are paying 2 - 3 ressources for his ability, which is reasonable.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> One of the reasons I was so excited about Radagast is his staff's cost reduction.  There's a reason that Mablung is in the stereotypical Eagles deck (Gwaihir edition).  They're about the least affordable tribe in existence.  But even without that, Tactics doesn't lack for expensive cards, like Citadel Plate and Beorn.  Yes, tactics needs resources.\n> \n>  \n\nSo there is your answer: if you need more tactics ressources, include Mablung. This might not work in a progression deck, that is why he was developed. And what do you think would happen, if you could get even more ressources besides Mablung's response? Games need to be balanced. Of course you are free to add Steward of Gondor and some other cards to enable playing it into a tactics deck.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> And since mono tactics isn't viable until Heirs of Numenor (and even then only in Siege/Battle quests), Horn of Gondor certainly will have leadership/lore/spirit cards on the table.  The biggest problem with the original Horn of Gondor isn't its utility, it is its rarity -- only one in the core set.  It wasn't a reliable source of resources, but it was nice when it was present.\n\nI assume, you mean mono tactics solo one-handed. In that case SoG and Song of Kings will give you many ressources. And while there is only one Horn in the core set, the rules allow up to three in a single deck, so proxying would be a solution. Just assume your Power in the Earth is a stand in for the Horn, or copy it, or buy additional core sets.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> The big problem with the Horn of Gondor is that it didn't exhaust, that's the feature that let it be part of infinite card/resource combos.  And oddly, they decided to fix it by nerfing the *common* case but not requiring exhaustion.  Now even self-discarders don't generate a resource -- Boromir can sacrifice himself without the Horn giving a peep.\n\nI would rather get additional compensation for sacrificing several allies in the same turn, than making many Rohan allies free in conjunction with Théoden or getting free ressources out of The Tree People. For example:\n\nAt the beginning of the planning phase you have three ressources, one silvan ally in hand and O Lórien and Horn of Gondor in play. Reduce the cost to play an ally by 1 with O Lórien, pay a ressource, play the one ally and trigger his enter play effect. Use The Tree People to bring the ally back to your hand, the Horn generates a ressource (back at 3) and search for an ally in the top five cards in your deck, bring it into play and trigger its enter play effect. Pay 2 ressources to bring the original ally back into play and trigger its effect again. Congratulation: You now have paid 2 ressources for 2 allies and 3 enter play effects (e.g. reduce your threat by 2 and draw an event card). Throw in a Galadhrim Weaver to shuffle The Tree People back into your deck and then tell me, whether this combo is overpowered. Even if the Horn exhausted, like you want it to, you could repeat this combo for a couple turns.

And that makes me a bit sad. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3702664","commentId":3702664,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1557959744,"content":"> 6 hours ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> As soon as you pay to keep Winged Guardian around, Horn of Gondor is not helping you and never did, so the errata changed nothing in that regard. If the Guardian is destroyed, you will still get the ressource. The only difference is, that you no longer get a ressource when you choose not to satisfy the forced effect, but in that case, why were you using the Guardian instead of a chump`? And Support of the Eagles even lets you use the Guardian like an attachment, so no extra cost for keeping him around at all.\n> Landroval is expensive, yes, but compared to Fate or Fortune, which costs the same with a similar effect, you also get a decent ally. I have already mentioned,﻿\n> \n> but some of you chose to ignore that part of my sentence completely. I can see a certain habit in these times, where quotes are cited without context to create a straw man.\n> \n> While Radagast himself is expensive, he also provides 2 willpower, which in that card pool is worth about 2 - 3 ressources, particularly in tactics, where Eagles of the Misty Mountains are the best, when it comes to questing with 2 willpower. If you want more willpower, use a different sphere. So you are paying 2 - 3 ressources for his ability, which is reasonable.﻿\n> \n> So there is your answer: if you need more tactics ressources, include Mablung. This might not work in a progression deck, that is why he was developed. And what do you think would happen, if you could get even more ressources besides Mablung's response? Games need to be balanced. Of course you are free to add Steward of Gondor and some other cards to enable playing it into a tactics deck.\n> \n> I assume, you mean mono tactics solo one-handed. In that case SoG and Song of Kings will give you many ressources. And while there is only one Horn in the core set, the rules allow up to three in a single deck, so proxying would be a solution. Just assume your Power in the Earth is a stand in for the Horn, or copy it, or buy additional core sets.\n> \n> I would rather get additional compensation for sacrificing several allies in the same turn, than making many Rohan allies free in conjunction with Théoden or getting free ressources out of The Tree People. For example:\n> \n> At the beginning of the planning phase you have three ressources, one silvan ally in hand and O Lórien and Horn of Gondor in play. Reduce the cost to play an ally by 1 with O Lórien, pay a ressource, play the one ally and trigger his enter play effect. Use The Tree People to bring the ally back to your hand, the Horn generates a ressource (back at 3) and search for an ally in the top five cards in your deck, bring it into play and trigger its enter play effect. Pay 2 ressources to bring the original ally back into play and trigger its effect again. Congratulation: You now have paid 2 ressources for 2 allies and 3 enter play effects (e.g. reduce your threat by 2 and draw an event card). Throw in a Galadhrim Weaver to shuffle The Tree People back into your deck and then tell me, whether this combo is overpowered. Even if the Horn exhausted, like you want it to, you could repeat this combo for a couple turns. And then, when you or another player have to chump block, you no longer get a refund.\n> So your proposal enables some crazy shenanigans, while shooting yourself into the foot.\n> \n> And besides: Boromir also did not use his Horn because some elves played Ring around the Rosie.\n\n1) You don't benefit from Horn of Gondor *when* you pay to retain a Winged Guardian after defense, but the resource you pay to retain a Winged Guardian could have been generated by Horn of Gondor.  For example, needing two defenses and lacking resources, you can let one Winged Guardian go and use that resource to retain the other -- or chump with a Vassal and pay the Winged Guardian with that.  And if you can't afford to keep a Winged Guardian, Horn of Gondor gets you an extra resource to help pay for a replacement next turn.\n\nWith the current Horn of Gondor, if you defend with Winged Guardian and intend to let it go (either because you're broke or trying to buff an Eagle of the Misty Mountain), you're actually hoping for a bad shadow to kill it outright.  I find that a bit peverse.\n\n2) Yes, if you keep a Winged Guardian around just to use his 4 defense for Support of the Eagles, there's no additional cost -- but you need 5 resources to get that combo, and once you get Misty out (another 4 resources) you'll want that to be the buff target.  And you might need more defense than the Support of Eagles hero provides....\n\n3) That Landroval is expensive (like other eagles) is the point of needing more resources.  Yes, Fortune or Fate is expensive too.  It's also a rarely-used sideboard card that was never popular outside of the brief heyday of pre-errata Caldara decks.\n\n4) Yes, Radagast provides 2 willpower, and willpower doesn't come cheap in Tactics.  But as you point out, you don't use Tactics to provide willpower, so that hardly matters.  Radagast's role in an early Eagles deck was to help pay for Eagles, and to a lesser extent heal eagles (the two cheap Eagles are unhealable).  But with a 5 resource investment, he takes 5 turns to payoff, and that can be a hard sell.  In the solo-capable Gwaihir edition of the Stereotypical Eagles Deck, Radagast drops out completely.\n\n5) What happens when you mix Horn of Gondor and Mablung?  That actually *is* the case in the Gwaihir edition (cost 5) of the Stereotypical Eagles Deck.  And you need all the help you can get, because the deck still has a lot of expensive cards.  Nor do I think it makes sense that a resource generator in Tactics should be nerfed just because another resource generator is subsequently introduced, especially when it's a hero -- heroes constrain deck design far more than cards in the deck.\n\nEven with both generators, Eagles decks were among the least popular and least powerful archetypes in the modern card pool, though I think hero Radagast and his staff will give the trait a much-needed boost.\n\n6) \"Games need to be balanced\".  In a cooperative game, neither decks nor cards *need* to be balanced, nor is it necessarily *desirable* that they be balanced.  Vilya decks are far more powerful than Eagles decks, and that's OK!  I've created and played a lot of Dori fellowships, nearly all of which would be more efficient if I subbed Beregond (either version) instead.  But that wouldn't make it more enjoyable to me, so I don't -- I specifically started the Dori fellowships because of his bad reputation as one of the worst heroes in the game.  Turns out he's actually fun and useful, just not in Beregond's class.  But that's NOT a reason to nerf Beregond!  It's not required that all hero defenders be \"balanced\", nor is it even desirable to do so.  It's not required that hero defense, ally defense, and chump defense be \"balanced\", nor (IMO) is it even desirable to do so.\n\n7) Yes, I'm saying mono tactics isn't solo-viable until later in the history of the game (TaTheoden and *especially* TaEowyn).  That means that Tactics is either going to be in a deck with other spheres or at the table with other spheres.  Horn of Gondor was the only resource generation outside leadership for quite a while in the game's progression.  It's true that you can play Steward of Gondor without leadership with Song of Kings or (more likely) Good Harvest, but again there's no reason that the existence of one generator should make the other generator be nerfed, *especially* when in the common case SoG is much better -- not restricted, 2 resources per turn, grants Gondor, and can give you the resources when you usually need them, in the planning phase.\n\n8 ) It's true that IF you are at the table with multiple chump-blocking players, Horn of Gondor is more powerful in its current state than if it had retained its original form (or even downgraded to discard) and exhausted.  But if your strategy isn't chump blocking, Horn of Gondor isn't going to be worth packing in its current form; the rare payoff isn't worth the deck space (and being Restricted doesn't help).\n\nBut if it exhausted, the common case would still be preserved while being totally unusable as part of an extreme card/resource loop.  And it could then be a reasonable resource generator from the beginning of the game, where resource generators are certainly needed.  Even if that generates a resource *every turn* in Silvan decks, so what?  One resource per turn from a unique, restricted item is not remotely game-breaking.  Nor is a single effectively free self-discarding 2-cost Rohan ally in a Rohan deck.  Silvan and Rohan decks aren't as powerful as Vilya decks, nor would they be if Horn of Gondor had a saner errata (most Silvan decks don't even use Tactics).\n\n9) Boromir did not use his Horn because of disappearing Silvans.  But he also did not use it because one of his compatriats died.  He used it to *summon aid* and *intimidate the enemy*, both of which worked, just not quick enough to save him.  Rewarding players for characters *dying* (or disappearing) isn't actually a thematic fit for the actual Horn of Gondor.  I also note that Boromir bore a long sword, a shield, *and* the Horn, so the Restricted is also not a thematic fit for the actual Horn of Gondor."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3702685","commentId":3702685,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1557961570,"content":"> On 5/14/2019 at 3:33 PM, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> I will answer your question marks as well as voice my opinion about some errata.\n> \n> Thicket of Spears and Out of Sight used to be a multi-target Feint, they used to prevent all attacks from engaged enemies against any player. I wonder why Hobbit-sense has not gotten an errata yet as it also prevent enemies from attacking. Narvi's Belt could be used to generate Baggins ressources as rees263 already pointed out. Nori reduced your threat after a dwarf character entered play under your control. Combine this with Sneak Attack or A very good Tale und you got some crazy threat reduction. I am not familiar with the old combo of Master of Lore, so I cannot comment this card. Maybe you can explain it to me.\n\nThis was, I think, the first of the draw-your-deck combos.  It went like this:\n\nGet Master of Lore, Legacy of Durin and Horn of Gondor in play.  Have Born Aloft in hand or top attachment in discard and Erebor Hammersmith in hand.\n\n1) Master of Lore names allies, reducing allies cost to 1 (minimum of 1).\n\n2) Play Erebor Hammersmith for 1 resource, draw a card, and get Born Aloft from discard if necessary.  Play Born Aloft on the Hammersmith.\n\n3) Discard Born Aloft to return Hammersmith to hand, get your resource back.  Go back to step 2 (until your entire deck is drawn.)\n\nNaturally, the designers in the wisdom broke the combo by nerfing poor Master of Lore, though he didn't make Hammersmith free.  They subsequently nerfed Horn of Gondor (adding exhaustion would've broken loop) after it showed up in another game-breaking loop -- though sadly, not by making it exhaust.  And now Legacy of Durin will be exhausting (which I prefer to the HoG fix) which at least preserves the common case.\n\nRecursion and/or attachments that don't exhaust is at the heart of every extreme combo, both can be easily fixed while preserving the common case -- make the attachment exhaust (Love of Tales) or remove the event after playing (Will of the West).  I don't consider shadow protection an extreme combo, but if you do and consider it errata worthy making ABB exhaust is *certainly* the correct way to errata IMO.  (Adding the Restricted is just nerfing for the sake of nerfing, though.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3702701","commentId":3702701,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1557962494,"content":"> 4 hours ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> You might have understood me wrong.

Together with O Lórien and the usual events this would result in a free ally every round and two other effects, one from the event and one from the ally.\n\nThe main objection to Horn of Gondor errata isn't that it was done *at all*, but that it changed and weakened the common case.  Changing Horn of Gondor to exhaust could have, and should have been done to fix the Master of Lore loop instead of picking on the master, (and as was done with the Love of Tales loop).  Horn of Gondor was in yet another loop before its errata IIRC, as was inevitable when it didn't exhaust.\n\nBut you're overstating the effect for Rohan and Silvan.  Theoden can't make \"many Rohan allies free\" with HoG because he can only discount one ally per turn.  With Gamling you could make Escort from Edoras free every turn, but everything else would have to be paid for, and Gamling + Horn for effectively a 4-wp quester isn't outrageous.\n\nThe original Horn can do well with Tree People, but O Lorien only discounts one card per turn, and once you play Tree People it's in the discard.  Playing a Weaver gets it back in your deck, not your hand.  Now with ElvenKing and Galion you could make money off the original Horn, but only one per turn because Elvenking exhausts.  I'll agree Silvan shenanigans had potential for serious resource generation with the original Horn of Gondor (though most Silvan decks didn't use Tactics), but that could've been easily fixed with exhaustion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3702827","commentId":3702827,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1557984749,"content":"> 6 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> 9) Boromir did not use his Horn because of disappearing Silvans.  But he also did not use it because one of his compatriats died.  He used it to *summon aid* and *intimidate the enemy*, both of which worked, just not quick enough to save him.  Rewarding players for characters *dying* (or disappearing) isn't actually a thematic fit for the actual Horn of Gondor.  I also note that Boromir bore a long sword, a shield, *and* the Horn, so the Restricted is also not a thematic fit for the actual Horn of Gondor.\n\nThat!\n\nSo, now that Erebor Battle Master has shown that a card can be errated twice (at least), may be we get a right version Horn of Gondor finally... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3702866","commentId":3702866,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1557994605,"content":"> 17 hours ago, PocketWraith said:\n> \n> OK I have to object to this. While some cards may be rather dependent on the card pool you have available, that's the case whatever their errata status, so let's disregard that for the moment. The only errata'd card I might consider underpowered following its errata is Master of Lore, and even then not 'vastly' so. This is the thing that annoys me most when people start complaining about errata - a lot of the time they seem to only consider the card in relation to its pre-errata state rather than to other cards in the pool, the actually reasonable means of assessing whether something is over- or underpowered. Which again, they're not underpowered, certainly not vastly so.\n\nBut I literally said: \"And newer players that buy a new pack will have no choice but to play vastly underpowered versions of those cards\"\n\nFor sure there are other cards out there, that are comparable to what the post errata cards are. But how many of the more senior players here had Boromir save their hides more than once by being able to ready more than a single time per phase? Or had the extra resources from Horn of Gondor to afford the key cards and pull off a win. Or just actually use Master of Lore in a deck? Hahaha. \n\nBut seriously we are finishing a saga campaign right now and the two brand new players pairing up with my wife and I are using strong Dwarf decks with all of these recently errata-ed cards. And now my whole play group loses out on what was helping us scrape through with our limited card pool because people couldn't regulate their playing experience and FFG didn't want to create a restricted list for the rare competitive game nights that they have. \n\nThese errated cards are vastly underpowered compared to their original incarnations. And in a competitive game I can see why there is a need for errata, in a cooperative game I can't. If you really wanted to break your game with the master of Lore loop then go on. Doesn't sound very fun to me. But it literally affects no one but the person playing it. Where errata-ing something every time a player finds a new combo is just silly to me as it only does the following:\n\n-starts to complicate newer players getting into the game\n\n-increase the difficulty for players like me that don't have the whole card pool to utilize on older scenerios that were balanced with those player cards\n\n-add mental fatigue to keep track of changes to be playing \"legit\".\n\n-take away strong combos for newer or less hardcore players that don't enjoy getting the floor wiped with their depowered heroes by Carn Dum and the like.\n\n \n\nI think erratas are really just a lot of rubbish that don't have a place in a cooperative friendly game. At this rate are we going to rebalance every card in the game? I'm sure everyone can list off dozens of cards that could be toned down, so where does it stop? Vilya? Gandalf? Elrond? Warden of Healing? Steward of Gondor? Sword that was Broken? I could go on and on but the line must be drawn here! \n\nNah we won't be following the errata anyways but it sure is annoying that people feel the need for errata because they can't regulate their own experience and the developers then have to create continuous errata.\n\nEdited May 16, 2019 by GILLIES291"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3702896","commentId":3702896,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1558003069,"content":"> 2 hours ago, GILLIES291 said:\n> \n> FFG didn't want to create a restricted list for the rare competitive game nights that they have.\n\nSuch an easy fix that would end all this errata discussion and avoid this pro- vs against erratas factions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3702901","commentId":3702901,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1558004239,"content":"The new errata incoming to Legacy of Durin and Erebor Battle Master at least preserve the common case; WANI changed functionality, imposing a cap would've been much friendlier.  Dwarf decks are the first power deck to come online in progression play, so nerfing its power level has disproportionate impact on new players (to the extent new players can play progression, always iffy given the reprint schedule)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3702915","commentId":3702915,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1558007206,"content":"> 35 minutes ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> The new errata incoming to Legacy of Durin and Erebor Battle Master at least preserve the common case; WANI changed functionality, imposing a cap would've been much friendlier.  Dwarf decks are the first power deck to come online in progression play, so nerfing its power level has disproportionate impact on new players (to the extent new players can play progression, always iffy given the reprint schedule).\n\nThis reminds me of something I've been wondering: I did progression play myself when getting into the game, and loved it.

It's 3 or 4 years since I obtained the whole card pool and started buying expansions as they were released, but before that I would pick up packs almost completely based off of what could be got for a good bargain at the moment.

You just engaged everything and let them rot. I cannot say whether this was the best way to nerf the situation but at least it no longer restricted Caleb in the invention of new tactics events. Not even spirit can play a single event for the rest of the game.\n> \n> I am fine with errata to Legacy of Durin and Erebor Battle Master. Five attack for a single ally (with Dáin) is enough, I see no justification why a dwarf should be able to one-hit everything in the game. Granted you need some work to achieve such a power level, but it is not as if you had to exhaust all other dwarves to use his ability or something. The nerf to Legacy is similar to the one of Nori.\n> \n> Burning Brand again is one of those cards trivializing the game, which I should be fine with nerfing, though I will have to adjust my deck-building and approach on shadow effects. I wonder why Elrond or Warden of Healing have not received an errata.\n\nThere must be some scenario-specific reason why Watchful Peace bringing back VP locations is problematic, because for the most part VP locations are obnoxious beasties you don't want to see again.  I took a brief look at VP locations and nothing jumped out of me.  Overall the errata preserves the common case, and it's a rarely used sideboard card in any case.\n\nDid the original wording of Trained for War exclude keywords, making it a rare positive errata?\n\nBlue Mountain Trader's errata was expected as soon as the card came out, and came in the form people expected, preserving a common case.  BMT didn't allow free redistribution between players (a maximum net transfer of one no matter how many exchanges were made), but within each player was equivalent of a solo Errand Rider that didn't exhaust.  I don't the effect was game-breaking (unlike Good Harvest, it couldn't be used to play a sphere you didn't have), and more importantly it required *cooperation* to work, so it could not affect anyone who didn't wish to be affected.  But all the same, the form of the errata was well done.  This was also a card that was errata-ed at the first opportunity after printing, I'm much more sympathetic to those (\"Whoops, we didn't mean to do that\") than to errata of long-standing cards--I think it's quite possible that the designers didn't realize its potential int he first place.\n\nThe key change for Love of Tales wasn't the 1 per hero (that's limiting, but since it's not unique you can still have multiple copies in play), but the exhaustion -- that nerfed the card/resource loop by restricting the resources.  Really, *any* attachment that generates resources and doesn't exhaust (or have a hard per round limit) is just waiting for the right combination to break the game.  This was not a surprise nerf, but the limit 1 per hero was not necessary after exhaustion was added.  Post-nerf it's returned to obscurity, though it at least is a reliable (and free) generator in a song-heavy deck.  It's a shame that the lesson about exhaustion wasn't followed for Horn of Gondor.\n\nOriginal WANI in conjunction with Lure of Moria works out to a net resource gain if you have more than 3 dwarves, and are willing to burn the powerful Lure of Moria event (or can easily recur it).  WANI/Lure of Moria/Legacy of Durin could be used for a draw-your-deck loop, so some limitation on WANI and/or Legacy of Durin makes sense -- but aside from the novelty value, if you can make a massive amount of money because you have a massive amount of dwarves on the table, you *already* are in a winning place and are just doing \"win more\".  My grief against the WANI errata isn't that it was limited, but that it was *changed* to be a much less useful card -- the common case was not preserved.  Put \"limit 3\" on it instead and it can still be used to help you get five dwarves out quickly.\n\nThe original errata to Thicket of Spears shows clearly that the designers had no problem with Hama \"trivializing combat\" for a single player.  The larger problem is that thanks to Mablung and TaAragorn, Hama-deck could steal other players' enemies as well and trivialize combat for *multiple* player.  The problem with the errata is that it doesn't preserve the common case -- rather than focusing on preventing the recursion of powerful cards, it incents Hama to *only* recur powerful cards by giving him a per-game limit.  Sending Thicket of Spears to the victory pile, or turning a Hama-recurred cards into an attachment which is removed or bottom-decked after play would've limited recursion of *specific* cards while still allowing Hama to do what he was designed to do.  As it is, the nerf pretends that while Hama playing Thicket of Spears every turn cannot be born, even at the cost of using the only card drawn and all of the resources generated, playing Thicket of Spears nine times is just fine (3x + 3 Hama + 3 tome).  I don't think the design space opened by allowing nine plays (or more in combination with other cards) but not every turn actually exists.  Honestly, if there's an event that's problematic in *any* sphere to recur repeatedly, it needs to go to the victory display after playing.\n\nTactics Gimli takes issue with your claim that one dwarf should not be able to one-shot everything.  The nerf to EBM capping at five preserves the common case, but strikes me as unnecessary -- if you have an obscene number of dwarves to generate obscene EBM attack values, you probably don't *need* EBM for obscene attack values.  It's preventing a win-more that was fun, but pointless.  At least EBM's cap doesn't leave him inferior to a same-cost card, like poor Leaflock.  More concerning to me is that with the change to EBM *and* Legacy of Durin on the heels of the WANI nerf, there's the appearance of a concerted effort to nerf dwarf decks in particular, as if there weren't other archtypes just as powerful or even more powerful.  Since dwarf deck is the first power deck progression-style, this hits new progression players hardest and I don't see that as a good

I'm comparing that card to that card as for newer players we don't have the whole card pool so we are limited to resource generation from things like Horn of Gondor and the like initially. You are comparing it to the pool as a whole. I stand by that Horn of Gondor is vastly underpowered compared to original Horn of Gondor. Likewise with the new versions compared with the original versions of Boromir, Hama, Caldara, and the other erratas. So if one only has the dead Marshes as a first expansion, then Horn of Gondor and Boromir for example are vastly underpowered compared to what they would have been for a new player. But power levels are subject to persona opinion so we can agree to disagree.\n\n \n\nI definitely played somewhat progression style as we were getting started.

But it allowed you to trade your tactics ressources into spirit ressources (when the trader returns back to you) and your partner could turn his leadership ressources into lore ones. This is the equivalent of having all songs of all spheres you control on all your heroes.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> The key change for Love of Tales wasn't the 1 per hero (that's limiting, but since it's not unique you can still have multiple copies in play), but the exhaustion -- that nerfed the card/resource loop by restricting the resources.  Really, *any* attachment that generates resources and doesn't exhaust (or have a hard per round limit) is just waiting for the right combination to break the game.  This was not a surprise nerf, but the limit 1 per hero was not necessary after exhaustion was added.  Post-nerf it's returned to obscurity, though it at least is a reliable (and free) generator in a song-heavy deck.  It's a shame that the lesson about exhaustion wasn't followed for Horn of Gondor.\n\nYou are right, I remembered the errata wrong. Still, what would several copies of Love of Tales mean on a single hero? That he love songs even more than another hero? Thematicly I cannot see a justification. When you already use songs, most ressources can be spent as fit anyway, at least for playing cards, so you could just as well spread the Love for Tales over all your heroes (by making them lore beforehand).\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Original WANI in conjunction with Lure of Moria works out to a net resource gain if you have more than 3 dwarves, and are willing to burn the powerful Lure of Moria event (or can easily recur it).  WANI/Lure of Moria/Legacy of Durin could be used for a draw-your-deck loop, so some limitation on WANI and/or Legacy of Durin makes sense -- but aside from the novelty value, if you can make a massive amount of money because you have a massive amount of dwarves on the table, you *already* are in a winning place and are just doing \"win more\".  My grief against the WANI errata isn't that it was limited, but that it was *changed* to be a much less useful card -- the common case was not preserved.  Put \"limit 3\" on it instead and it can still be used to help you get five dwarves out quickly.\n\nI am not sure, I can follow you. If you want five dwarves, you already have at least Thorin and Ori in play, and probably also a third dwarven hero. With two dwarven allies, or one ally and Bombur hero, you have already reached the magical number of five dwarves. So this only leaves the case of a single dwarven ally, so you are missing out on a single ressource. Granted, this might make a difference, but not as severe as you made it sound.\n\n> Quote\n> \n>  \n> \n> The original errata to Thicket of Spears shows clearly that the designers had no problem with Hama \"trivializing combat\" for a single player.  The larger problem is that thanks to Mablung and TaAragorn, Hama-deck could steal other players' enemies as well and trivialize combat for *multiple* player.  The problem with the errata is that it doesn't preserve the common case -- rather than focusing on preventing the recursion of powerful cards, it incents Hama to *only* recur powerful cards by giving him a per-game limit.  Sending Thicket of Spears to the victory pile, or turning a Hama-recurred cards into an attachment which is removed or bottom-decked after play would've limited recursion of *specific* cards while still allowing Hama to do what he was designed to do.  As it is, the nerf pretends that while Hama playing Thicket of Spears every turn cannot be born, even at the cost of using the only card drawn and all of the resources generated, playing Thicket of Spears nine times is just fine (3x + 3 Hama + 3 tome).  I don't think the design space opened by allowing nine plays (or more in combination with other cards) but not every turn actually exists.  Honestly, if there's an event that's problematic in *any* sphere to recur repeatedly, it needs to go to the victory display after playing.\n> \n>  \n\nAs I already said, I cannot say whether this was the best way to nerf the situation.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Tactics Gimli takes issue with your claim that one dwarf should not be able to one-shot everything.  The nerf to EBM capping at five preserves the common case, but strikes me as unnecessary -- if you have an obscene number of dwarves to generate obscene EBM attack values, you probably don't *need* EBM for obscene attack values.  It's preventing a win-more that was fun, but pointless.  At least EBM's cap doesn't leave him inferior to a same-cost card, like poor Leaflock.  More concerning to me is that with the change to EBM *and* Legacy of Durin on the heels of the WANI nerf, there's the appearance of a concerted effort to nerf dwarf decks in particular, as if there weren't other archtypes just as powerful or even more powerful.  Since dwarf deck is the first power deck progression-style, this hits new progression players hardest and I don't see that as a good thing.\n\nWell, Gimli needs a lot of attachment to one-shot the Balrog or Smaug. Nevertheless, Gimli is a hero and thus unique, the Battle Master is not. You could nearly see it equivalent to a Battle Master giving +1 Attack to every dwarf ally you control, only concentrated on a single ally. Some say, Dáin is overpowered...\n\nIf you consider Leaflock in a poor shape, then what about Denethor? I am not concerned about nerfs to power decks. We still do not know, what Caleb is planning and what might be nerfed next time.

In my opinion Eagles are strong enough and buffing Eagles of the Misty Mountains is enough reward, there is no need to earn a ressource, as I already said before.\n\nI did not mean many as in \"many per turn\", rather as in \"more than just Snowbourn Scout, Escort from Edoras and the Riddermark's Finest\". But Gamling, Horn, Théoden and Riddermark's Finest would allow you to put 4 progress per round for a single ressource, or 2 progress for free. It is said, with the existence of Asfaloth the number of progress needed to clear a location has been increased to at least three. The combination above would be a bit more work and if you are willing to pay something extra even more effective.

But the point is, that the Horn would make one Silvan ally per turn free with O Lórien and one of the events. Of course you could argue that Heir of Valandil also makes an ally free per turn, but being engaged with three or more enemies is riskier. And King of Dale needs a lot of card draw, as Dale allies without their proper attachments are weak.\n\nA Silvan solo deck might usually not use tactics, but someone else could."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3703156","commentId":3703156,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1558028092,"content":"> 19 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> 1) You don't benefit from Horn of Gondor *when* you pay to retain a Winged Guardian after defense, but the resource you pay to retain a Winged Guardian could have been generated by Horn of Gondor.  For example, needing two defenses and lacking resources, you can let one Winged Guardian go and use that resource to retain the other -- or chump with a Vassal and pay the Winged Guardian with that.  And if you can't afford to keep a Winged Guardian, Horn of Gondor gets you an extra resource to help pay for a replacement next turn.\n> \n> With the current Horn of Gondor, if you defend with Winged Guardian and intend to let it go (either because you're broke or trying to buff an Eagle of the Misty Mountain), you're actually hoping for a bad shadow to kill it outright.  I find that a bit peverse.\n\nAs I said, buffing a Eagles of the Misty Mountains is already reward enough. I prefer my Winged Guardians alive, as they have something the Eagles or a Defender of Rammas have not: Sentinel. Anecdotal side note: This year at the Lure of Middle-earth, someone at my table had a mono tactics deck and pondered whether he should pay for the Guardian or let it buff the Eagles. I asked him to pay because of Sentinel, which saved our lives.\n\nAnd when I chump with a Vassal I will get my ressource with the current Horn of Gondor, so I am not sure, what you wanted to say with that part.

And if memory serves, you were the one to start the solo league which is competitive by design, even though restricted in deck building. I am not denying that Vilya or Beregond is more powerful than eagles or Dori respectively. But the game has a certain economy with ressources and card draw versus the encounter deck.

You are right, that Restricted makes no sense on the Horn, as the only other restriced ressource generators are Sword of Númenor and Orcrist, both require killing an enemy.\n\n \n\nEdited May 16, 2019 by Amicus Draconis"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3703166","commentId":3703166,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1558028916,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> Black Rides has some friendly VP locations like Bag End, Woody End, Bamfurlong, Midgewater, The Troll's Camp etc. Returning those cards for the next staging step would make the game easier.

You could nearly see it equivalent to a Battle Master giving +1 Attack to every dwarf ally you control, only concentrated on a single ally. Some say, Dáin is overpowered...\n> \n> If you consider Leaflock in a poor shape, then what about Denethor? I am not concerned about nerfs to power decks. We still do not know, what Caleb is planning and what might be nerfed next time. He surely is not errataing cards out of boredom.\n> \n> Tolkien describes Vilya as \"the mightiest of the Three\", thus second only to the One Ring. A powerful artifact justifies a powerful. But I was thinking of his unlimited healing bonus, which doubles the effect of the Warden of Healing. You say a limit is reasonable, but not needed. Sounds paradox to me. Regardless, I will disagree on this point.\n\n1) Yes, I can see where recycling Bag End would be very profitable, between zero threat, card draw, and stalling in stage one.  Of course, the designers could've made recycling Bag End less attractive for recycling by giving it high threat, since it starts as the active location.  It's not immune, so you can still swap it out and stall on stage one as long as you like.\n\nThematically, Frodo could return to Bag End for any reason he likes -- he is not, at this point, intent on reaching Rivendell ASAP and he is still hoping that Gandalf will show up before he leaves the shire.  He delayed leaving Bag End as long as possible and in fact left Bag End before returning for his final departure (that's when he overheard the Gaffer-half of the conversation with a Black Rider).  Stalling on stage one and putting off leaving Bag End as long as possible would be *highly thematic* -- but I'll grant that exploring Bag End a few times would make the scenario much easier.\n\n2) I'm not sure why you're still trying to reword the effect of BMT.  It's unlimited resource redistribution within a player's heroes.  This is not the same as Good Harvest, and it's also not exactly the same as having Songs of each sphere you control on each hero.  For some cards/heroes, it matters *which* hero has the resources, and how many.  The equivalent would be an Errand-Rider in solo play who doesn't exhaust for his action.\n\n3) If you must have a thematic justification for the existence of multiple non-tangible attachments on the same character, I don't see what's wrong with someone loving Tales twice as much as someone else who also loves Tales.  Sam probably fits that description well.  Similarly, I don't think there's anything wrong with one hero having more Unexpected Courage than another hero -- Sam also fits that description well.  I regretfully acknowledge that it's probably a good idea to break unlimited resource/card loops and that means resource-generating attachments *should* exhaust -- but I don't think there's any reason to go on to further nerf those cards based on arguable thematic arguments, especially when the card (like Love of Tales) isn't especially powerful in the common case anyway.\n\n4) Five dwarves isn't useful just for Thorin, Ori, and to a lesser extent Oin, it's also useful for a number of allies.  But let's take a hypothetical case with both Thorin and Ori -- Thorin/Ori/Nori, tri-sphere deck, want to get to 5 ASAP.  There's two 1-cost allies (Sellsword and Record-Keeper), one of which will go away if you can't pay to keep them.  There's a lot of potential 2-cost dwarves.  In this case, the ability to use a 1-cost ally for WANI makes a huge difference on whether you can quest/fight and still have five dwarves at the beginning of the next round for Thorin and Ori.  I've used WANI to exhaust *only* a single Record-Keeper so I can get Zigil Miner out for my five, leaving all heroes ready.  That's not possible anymore, but it's worth burning WANI just to setup quickly on the most important turn -- the first.  Yes, when I get a huge swarm of dwarves out I can use WANI for huge piles of resources, but who cares?  If I've got a huge swarm of dwarves, I don't *need* lots of resources, I'm already in control.  WANI's top end is win-more.  It's using WANI for 1-2 allies at the beginning of the game that made the most difference, and that option is gone even though it wasn't overpowered.\n\n5) Some do say that Dain is overpowered, though LeBoromir with Visionary Leadership does the same thing for Gondor.  So what?  If EBM is hitting for ten, you've still got ten dwarf allies and are very likely already in complete control.  EBM only gets ridiculous when the outcome isn't in doubt.  And when the outcome *isn't* in doubt, EBM isn't that powerful.  That's why I think the EBM errata isn't necessary, even though the errata also doesn't do much harm for the same reason.\n\n6) Yes, Denethor (ally) is also a lame card.  Some people regret cards they consider overpowered -- I regret cards that are too weak.  I don't know what Caleb has in mind, but errata that purely affects power level can make a playable card unplayable if nerfed too hard, while errata enhancing weak cards impacts practically no one attached to the current version while actually expanding the effective card pool.  I think it's more elegant (and avoids the cost/annoyance of errata) to get new cards that synergize with old bad cards, but the few positive errata that have been made were uncontroversial and welcome.\n\n7) *If* you were going to limit Warden of Healing, putting a limit on the readies would be the most reasonable errata -- it preserves the common case, while restricting a rare case (e.g. paying repeatedly for Gloin's healing so that he can take any number of undefended attacks -- with Elrond at the table and Song of Wisdom or Narvi's Belt on Gloin he can pay for his healing completely with Elrond + Warden of Healing, as long as he has sufficient hp).  Does that edge case justify errata to Warden of Healing?  It takes some setup, but can match Super Beregond *without* needing readies, and has the potential to monopolize defense in a pickup game.  If it were deemed obnoxious enough to errata, restricting the ready on the Warden would be the least obnoxious way to do it IMO.  But in no way do I consider the amazing efficiency of Elrond + Warden of Healing (the common case) to be a problem that requires fixing the *common* case.\n\nEdited May 16, 2019 by

Many players did so, and their wins have not been invalidated by the errata.\n\nIt may be easy for you to say that and we will keep playing the old way because I won't tell the more casual players about the errata. It does make my wife and I feel bad and annoyed because as dale points out it's like the developers have stated \"oh this card is too strong, even in its progression style, because they altered the cards in the packs that contain it. This is how the card should have always been.\" A new player that picks up burning brand and eventually progresses to Carn Dum is going to have a **** of a time trying to win against that scenerio without it being the old way. And why would someone want to make up different rules for their new card as it's printed? How would casual players even know they have the option to change the text on their cards to something more favorable that used to be? And would they want too? Or would it feel to much like cheating? \n\n \n\nWe experienced this in Star Wars Imperial Assault where on the second mission I was controlling the Imeprials and the Rebels could not get through this locked and reinforced door. They were attacking it with everything they had and could at most do 1-2 damage against it a round. They lost utterly. I was so perplexed as to why it was such a hard mission for them and then after looking into it later I discovered that they had errata-ed and toned down these rebel saboteur characters to no longer be able to pierce through the doors defenses. They had done it for the competitive scene and it worked for that. But for the mostly cooperative game it imbalances it to the point of being actually near impossible to achieve, and completely impossible if this specific mission was randomly selected as the second mission. There was no guide saying \"oh by the way this is what this card used to say, feel free to change it for this mission\" anywhere.\n\nBack to LOTR: It took me many many many tries to beat Carn Dum and a sentinel multi-readying Song of Wisdom Burning Brand Boromir is what finally helped us get through it. And even then it was still not easy. Now officially those things are no longer allowed. And for newer players with the new text on Boromir and Burning Brand... God help them against that scenario when they get there progression-wise.\n\n \n\nYes I'm sure you or someone else will say you can build another tailored perfectly tuned deck to take on a particular scenario, but that's not fun for us. Part of the enjoyment of this fantastic game comes from playing who we want to and with whatever decks we want. We can control our own difficulty levels and can help balance out some of the much weaker hero choices through strong \"OP\" cards like Burning brand. And if that's too much for other players due to the rare competive versus events then add a restricted list to that rules set. That would be far far more easier then buggering up everyone else's game, taking away fun combos to help out newer or less hardcore players, and not adding mental fatigue to an already heavy game.\n\nSeriously how clean would a simple \"When constructing fellowships for competive mode, the following cards are not allowed to be chosen/have the following restrictions/have their cost increased by # : boom insert list here\"\n\nThat way you guys going to play the competitive event could have the upgraded challenge but you wouldn't make my more casual group forced to make a choice between following the rules or feeling bad because we are making up our own rules and trying to justify it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3703239","commentId":3703239,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1558035395,"content":"> 39 minutes ago, GILLIES291 said:\n> \n> Back﻿ to LOTR: It took me many many many tries to beat Carn Dum and a sentinel multi-readying Song of Wisdom Burning Brand Boromir is what finally helped us get through it.

The idea that his ability was too strong in progression style is laughable. I don't know if anyone even used his ability when we only had the core set available. The errata was obviously done to squash combos that developed later in the card pool.\n\nIn fact, it's a pretty low blow to the designer's intelligence to say that the card has been too strong from the beginning and they only just realized now.\n\nTo repeat what I said above, reprinting a card with new text is not necessarily an admission that the original design was wrong, or that any win with the old text are invalid. It is needed so that new players that buy that pack have the correct version of the card for modern content.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Back to LOTR: It took me many many many tries to beat Carn Dum and a sentinel multi-readying Song of Wisdom Burning Brand Boromir is what finally helped us get through it.

I never heard from the wave of new players that were unable to solo Shadow and Flame without Hama, or Three Trials without Boromir. If a new player is really hitting a wall beating Carn Dum without ABB, they will either skip it, like they probably did with Dol Guldur, or simply look online at one of the many published decks that have beaten Carn Dum without ABB.\n\nEdited May 16, 2019 by Seastan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3703484","commentId":3703484,"userName":"soullos","timestamp":1558053655,"content":"I found it curious that they errated earlier cards in the life of the game now (if needed, really, it stings to see the errata but I can see why it was done.

Errata that are released at the earliest opportunity.  These are presumably errors that snuck through playtesting.\n\n2. Errata that are released at the first opportunity after a quest or quests is released, because of a specific interaction seen with a player card and the mechanics/cards of that release.  Whether the interaction was forseen or not discovered until after release, it was deemed better to change the player card rather than call out the interaction in the quest-specific rules.\n\n3. Errata that are released to break a specific player card combination, in the first FAQ after that combination is discovered/publicized.  These are presumably fixing something broken, but the newly discovered combo may or may not involve any newly released cards.\n\n4. Errata that are released well after the original card without an obvious broken combination -- power nerfs presumably prompted either by increased strength in a larger pool or by a change in designer attitudes -- if memory serves, most of the errataed cards were not originally released by Caleb.\n\nIt's a bit of a judgement call where these lie -- was Beravor/Protector of Lorien nerfed in FAQ 1.3 because it was the first FAQ to actually use errata, because Beravor + 3x-per-player UC + Protector of Lorien generated massive willpower, or just as a power nerf?  I'll leave those two out of the list, and A Elbereth Gilthoniel because I'm not sure of the context, but here's where the others would fit IMO :\n\n1: Zigil Miner, Nori, Thror's Map, Master of Lore [combo piece], Ravens of the Mountains,  Blue Mountain Trader\n\n2: Feint, Thicket of Spears, Narvi's Belt , A Watchful Peace, Trained for War\n\n3: Will of the West, Horn of Gondor, Love of Tales, Wandering Took, Out of the Wild, Wingfoot, We Are Not Idle\n\n4: Erebor Battle Master, Expert Treasure Hunter, Boromir, Hama, Caldara, A Burning Brand, Legacy of Durin, Erebor Battle Master again.\n\nThe essence of the ABB superdefender is all present in the very first cycle -- Unexpected Courage, Song of Wisdom (if not Lore), A Burning Brand.  The premise that 4 safe defenses are fine (up to 13 if players cooperate) but more than that is abusive is hard for me to swallow.  Here's the repeatable readying attachments (that can ready after a defense) in release order:\n\nUnexpected Courage (core)\n\nFast Hitch (Dead Marshes) [hobbit only]\n\nMiruvor (Shadow and Flame) [requires putting back on deck and using your draw to repeat]\n\nSpare Hood and Cloak (OHUH) [requires somebody else having and exhausting]\n\nHeir of Mardil (Celebrimbor's Secret) [requires Noble and getting a resource, unique]\n\nShadowfax (Treason of Saruman) [requires Gandalf, unique]\n\nArmored Destrier (Temple of the Deceived) [requires Sentinel or Leadership, takes a restricted slot]\n\nMagic Ring (Crossings of Poros) [limit 1 per hero and 1 per deck, raises threat]\n\nElvenking (Fire in the Night) [requires Silvan and return to hand of Silvan ally, unique]\n\nRing of Thror (Ghost of Framsburg) [requires Dwarf, unique, guarded]\n\nIn the case of Mighty Beregond, the easy readies are UC, Armored Destrier (wastes a restricted slot), and Magic Ring (1 per deck, 1 per hero).  There's a host of events or temporary attachments that ready, but there were plenty of those when Tactics Beregond came out.  In the common case, the super defender is where he's always been.  There's two exceptions that can dramatically increase the number of readies:\n\n1) Erestor + Miruvor.  Miruvor as repeatable ready has the unattractive feature of costing you your only draw for a single ready, and only Bilbo and Gleowine got you past that.  But Erestor/Arwen/Defender guarantees you can draw all three Miruvor and pay for at least two -- guarantees all three if the defender has spirit.  Looking at the decks using Beregond/ABB/UC (not that many), this is a reasonably popular combination.  However, at this point it's not exactly a new combination, we're on the third cycle since Angmar and there's been two FAQs since this popped up.\n\n2) Spare Hood and Cloak + Long Lake Trader.  This isn't nearly as efficient as Erestor/Miruvor, since it requires a LLT for every cloak and also a suitable target to use it (likely the North Realm Lookout).  Outside a Dale deck it's a three card combo to provide a single repeatable ready -- inside a Dale Deck the excellent Redwater Sentry really reduces the value of having a hero defender in the first place.  I only saw one deck that bothered with this combo.\n\nIndeed, looking at the ABB/Beregond/UC decks, except for the Erestor decks the norm for readying was Unexpected Courage supplemented by a handful of temporary readies depending on sphere (Behind Strong Walls or Desparate Defense).  If readying too much is a problem, you don't have to fix all readying cards at all -- you would just have to put \"limit 1 per hero\" on the very few non-unique/restricted attachments that provide repeatable readying, all of which were released before Beregond.  I'm not necessarily saying that the designers *should* do this, though it's the logical extension of TaBoromir's nerf.  It'd be a much bigger hit to SuperBeregond in 4-player than nerfing ABB, I think.  My point is rather that if the Miruvor/Erestor/UC combo providing up to seven defenses (and getting to key cards quickly) wasn't deemed \"abusive\" enough to fix in FAQ 1.8 and 1.9, I don't think the single ready from Magic Ring and the expensive setup of the Long Lake Trader combo remotely crosses the line for the next FAQ.  In terms of the common case, most new players have only a single Unexpected Courage anyways.\n\nGoogle tells me that way back when FAQ 1.3 nerfed Beravor, making UC limit 1 per hero was suggested as an alternative errata.\n\nEdited May 17, 2019 by dalestephenson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3703723","commentId":3703723,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1558095537,"content":"> 14 hours ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> Look at Wandering Took, from the Core Set, which received an errata limiting it to once per round.

This makes on average less than 2.5 ressources per card, which is less than you generate per round (up to 4 without the Horn). And I would not even waste my money on Landroval or Descendant in most cases.\n> \n> [6 -- \"balance\" between decks/cards not only not needed, not even necessarily desirable]\n> \n> You keep saying this is a cooperative game, when the designers introduced competitive scenarios to the game. And if memory serves, you were the one to start the solo league which is competitive by design, even though restricted in deck building. I am not denying that Vilya or Beregond is more powerful than eagles or Dori respectively. But the game has a certain economy with ressources and card draw versus the encounter deck. If you hand out too much of them, the game becomes too easy.\n> \n> [7 -- existence of other resource generators don't justify nerfing a different generator]\n> \n> There is a reason, as I said above: game economics.\n> \n> [8 -- changing the common case makes Horn of Gondor less worthy of inclusion]\n> \n> You answered it yourself: If you deem Horn of Gondor unworthy, leave it out of the deck.\n> \n> [9 -- current trigger for Horn of Gondor isn't actually thematic]\n> \n> But in that case the Horn should generate a ressource when an enemy is revealed or engaged (which is already done by Mablung). You are right, that Restricted makes no sense on the Horn, as the only other restriced ressource generators are Sword of Númenor and Orcrist, both require killing an enemy.\n\n1) You are correct that *if* you need sentinel, because you're playing multiplayer (almost guaranteed, if you're mono-tactics) and need to defend cross-table, keeping your Winged Guardians around is preferable.  In a solo deck the value of sentinel is extremely limited, and while mono-tactics Eagles decks had to wait for later cards to be solo-viable, Eagles in a tactics-dominant deck were solo-capable before then.  Consider the Return to Mirkwood deck used for Beorn's Path, something I recommend *every* new player follow as far as possible.  It has Eagles (3x Vassal, 3x Guardian, 2x Misty, 3x Eagles are Coming).  I can tell you from experience, tactics resources were tight.  It also has 3x Gandalf and 3x Escort from Edoras and (of course) the lone copy of Horn of Gondor from the core set.  If it came up, it was very useful.  If Beorn were redoing it now, I doubt it would make the cut.\n\nBuffing Misty and getting a resource is obviously better than buffing Misty alone.  It's not remotely game-breaking, though, and wasn't even powerful enough to make Eagles a popular archtype -- Vassal/Guardians account for a maximum of six buffs during the entire game, and it's usually much less.  No effect in the game is \"reward enough\" to discourage looking for synergies with that effect.\n\nIt's true that if you chump block with Vassal you get a reward from Horn of Gondor in its current form.  But in its original form you get a reward from Horn of Gondor whether he defends *or* attacks, so a hypothetical exhausting HoG with its original reward is worth including in an Eagles deck, and the current version is typically not.\n\n2) My usual procedure with Support of the Eagles is to try to get a Vassal and/or Guardian out first, not using them, and then get out Support of Eagles on the real target -- as you might expect, also trying to get the real target to ready.  Then I get Misty out, let the Vassal go (keeps attack at 3) then let the Guardian go (keeps defense at 4) -- any Eagles discarded after that just bump it higher.  Misty is a backup combat action, if I've got readying on a hero with a Support of the Eagles (or better, three of them) it may end up being an expensive quester.  It's an expensive setup, and without other cards leaving play doesn't provide a huge return on the original Horn -- but if that's all you have it's better than nothing.\n\n3) Who plans on having a hero killed?  Landroval's expensive insurance, but because he's an Eagle he shows up in Eagle decks for thematic reasons, while a Veteran Axehand does not.  Landroval's strictly superior to Axehand, having more willpower, attack and hit points plus a useful-if-things-go-badly ability.  He's also much more expensive.  I don't view \"Tactics players should just play cheaper cards instead\" as a valid reason for nerfing a Tactics resource generator.  Tactics has some expensive cards, why not give Tactics tools to help pay for them?\n\n4) However useful 2 willpower may be (and in tactics, providing willpower usually *isn't* a big concern), it doesn't pay for cards.  Radagast helps pay for Eagles, which are expensive, but he costs 5 up front and so takes 5 to break even.  That's why he drops out of Eagles decks and isn't found at all outside them.  Radagast's Staff coming in the next pack should make him much more attractive, as that is well worth the money to get in play.\n\n5) I believe 2.5 per card is one of the most expensive per-card values in all my Stereotypical Decks.  It has no cost reducers, but it does have a card (The Eagles are Coming) that can draw expensive Eagles into your hand.  With Mablung the 3-4 resources covers the card you draw at the beginning of the turn, but you start with 7 cards and no resources.  It will be one of the slowest decks in the series to empty its hand.\n\n6) Yes, the designers have introduced a competitive mode into this cooperative game, and soon it may actually be available for purchase at a store near me -- that doesn't change the fact that it is designed and 99.9% played as a cooperative/solo game -- in fact, at last year's Fellowship event I ended up playing the quest *cooperatively* instead of competitively.  Handling \"balance\" for the tiny share of play in competitive mode would be much better handled with a restricted list than errata that hampers the vastly larger pool of cooperative players.\n\nYes, the solo league does introduce a competitive element into cooperative play.  But there aren't a lot of us playing in it, I think most who play do it for fun rather than trying to design the most efficient deck possible, we explicitly use an out-of-the-rules variant with the tokens to guarantee wins against each scenario (eventually) and use arbitrary tiebreakers in the common case where no tokens at all are needed.  I am *totally* uninterested in any league rules (let alone errata) to ensure that the decks used in the league are of equivalent strength, and incoming errata *complicates* the league rather than improving it.  It's possible someone in the league is using the new A Burning Brand already....\n\n\"Too easy\" and \"too hard\" is purely subjective, and easily controlled by player decisions of what to put in their decks *and* what mode of a quest to play.  With the exception of lone players ruining a pickup multiplayer game, there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON for the designers to worry about a particular combination being \"too strong\", as cooperative players who think it too strong can just not play it -- it follows that when *fixing* the possibility of a lone player doing an extreme combo, the least damage would be done by preserving the common case and trying to errata to only affect the extreme case.  Exhausting Horn of Gondor would've done that way back in the Hammersmith/Born Aloft combo, they didn't fix it and so it got exploited again.  I'm not complaining that they errata-ed Horn of Gondor, I'm complaining about *how* they errata-ed Horn of Gondor.\n\n7) I don't believe in a fixed \"game economy\", but if I did, the *usual* usage of Horn of Gondor did not break it even before errata.  Certainly an exhausting Horn of Gondor that reacted to leaving play would not.\n\n8 ) Yes, I am leaving Horn of Gondor out of decks.  I used to use it -- now I don't.  There are still circumstances where the card is useful to somebody, but they took a card that *was* useful to me and made it not useful to me.  My effective card pool got smaller because of the errata.\n\n9) I would love to see an actually thematic effect for Boromir's Horn, but it would have to be renamed to exist as a player card.  Mablung generates when engaged -- a Horn that generates a resource when *revealed* would be kind of cool, and should exhaust when it does so."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3703788","commentId":3703788,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1558101657,"content":">

But give that deck you suggested a try and see how it works out. Paying 3 cost for Gandalf by recycling Tomes is not the same as paying 1. You're also \"wasting\" all your Word of Commands fetching more copies. The deck you're describing sounds fully devoted to the Gandalf recycle strategy.

As you know, I'm not concerned about \"balance\" or \"monopolization\" when players cooperate or play alone.\n\nOf course, even if you accept that the Hama/Thicket combination was a problem needing to be fixed, it doesn't necessarily follow that the errata Hama received was the best way to fix it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3704347","commentId":3704347,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1558185402,"content":"> 15 hours ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> [on Radagast/Hama/tactics deck]\n> \n> I do agree that the Hama errata doesn't necessarily prevent all abuse of his ability.

It is possible to have a card pool in which a 2 card combo is well-balanced while the same combo reduced to 1 card is seen as overpowered. \n\n7 attacks back-to-back with one Miruvor is impressive, since it requires using all five consumables in the deck on consecutive turns.  No, I don't think that's sustainable.  I didn't watch the video, but I did see in the deck description \"For one attempt I had a bunch of enemies engage me all in one turn, and Beregond defended five or six times, putting Unexpected Courage to shame, and next turn I just reshuffled my deck and drew into all the same readying cards and did it all again.\"  The first burst of defenses seems easy enough, since if you don't need the consumable readies they'll accumulate until you need them for a burst of defenses.  But I'd think drawing most (or all, for seven defenses) after a reshuffle would require either remarkable luck or a huge pile of resources to exploit Elven-Light with.  How many turns does this deck take before you've run through it four times?\n\nIf you include one copy each of UC, Magic Ring and Miruvor it's slightly easier to set up as 3x UC -- there's three cards either way, Miruvor is cheaper and Magic Ring is neutral.  If Miruvor/UC were 1 per hero you could get setup faster by including 3x of Miruvor and UC in your deck, at the cost of deck space.  But though it'd give you 3 readies, it's at a higher cost than 3x UC, since Magic Ring costs threat and Miruvor costs draw.  Still, you can get additional draw and SpBeregond can get your threat back.  4 + consumables can't be prevented.  7 defenses with just UC and Miruvor could be, if that much readying is a problem that needs to be fixed in the first place.  ABB nerf doesn't fix that -- you were just saying you took 7 back-to-back, and the only shadow cancellation is in the sideboard with only the 2x Lembas for healing.  When you can defend for 6-11, there's an awful lot of shadows that can be ignored.\n\nIt's a fair point that ABB + Song of Wisdom is a two card combo that also has to be played in the right order -- but giving sentinel to a Lore hero is a one card combo and there's two different cards that can do it (three if Elf/Dwarf), still not that common.  I think a larger problem rests with the Lore defenders themselves:\n\nDenethor is fragile (3 hp) and has an ability that needs him ready at turn end and is most powerful in solo.\n\nElrond wants to use an exhaustion on Vilya.\n\nRossiel is fragile (3 hp) and needs setup to defend for 4 instead of 2.\n\nTreebeard has excellent defensive stats, but his ability lets him boost willpower/attack only and he can't have restricted attachments.\n\nAnd that's the entire set until Radagast comes out, who actually is a good defensive candidate at 3/4, especially since he can also quest for free and has no other exhaustion demands other than Word of Command.  Though being Istari does hurt him with the potential defensive attachments.\n\nI suspect the lack of sentinel Lore heroes isn't because of ABB in particular, I think it has to do with stereotyping sentinel as a leadership/tactics thing.  The only three spirit/tactics sentinel are all repeat heroes that had their first version as sentinel also.  (OTOH, there's only one sentinel lore ally, and spirit has three, though Jubyar's got his own shadow protection going.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3704674","commentId":3704674,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1558241889,"content":"> 39 minutes ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> I think a larger problem rests with the Lore defenders themselves:\n\nThis is my point though.

I don't expect to see many competing for that role in the same sphere. But lore is the only sphere with none.\n\nFor \"defense ability\" I was thinking specifically of 3+ defense with defense-related ability, which excludes Frodo and Rossiel.  I just forgot about Dain, and his ability doesn't link into traditional spirit strength (though it obviously links with dwarven mining, which has its key cards in spirit).  I also specified abilities -- sentinel can be a useful trait, but a 3 attack/2 defense hero with sentinel is not what I consider to be a dedicated defensive hero.\n\nDistinct may not be the right word to group the two Beregonds together, but they deserve to be grouped together.  I don't see releasing Beregond in Spirit as happening because Spirit needed a first class defender, I see releasing Beregond in Spirit to be a consequence of needing to release Beregond in Flame of the West -- he *had* to be in that box, and neither Lore nor Leadership makes sense for Beregond in the context of Book V.  The three named individuals chosen to be first class sentinel defenders (Beregond, Grimbeorn, Erkenbrand) have no connections to Lore.  Now it's perfectly true that the designers didn't have to release a Beregond hero at all, they could've had a (Tactics) Beregond ally and moved LeEomer up a box, and that would've been just as thematic.  But to buy that the designers aim was specifically to provide Spirit a first-classs defender while neglecting Lore, I'd need to see an *invented* hero in that role.\n\nFastred comes close in that while he's not invented, there's nothing at all known about it him save his death and nation.  But given Rohan, putting him in Spirit is the most natural sphere (and Lore least likely), and his ability specifically synergizes with Rohan-attacking-staging -- plus he reduces threat, which puts him firmly in Spirit.  There is exactly *one* hero who was FFG invented on your list of defensive heroes, and that hero is in Lore.  Further, the other Lore hero on your list (Aragorn) actually has an ability that naturally belongs in Spirit!  While there's an imbalance, the FFG-invented hero and the out-of-expected-sphere ability are both butressing Lore.\n\nWhen you release a 3+ defense sentinel hero, I don't think you're signaling that it's meant to be that sphere's best defensive hero (was that really the purpose of releasing Grimbeorn in tactics) -- I think it's just signaling that it's meant to be a candidate for the best multiplayer defensive hero, period.  With such a small sample size drawing broad conclusions from Lore's exclusion doesn't seem warranted to me.\n\nIf the designers are going, sometime in the future, release such a player in Lore, what would it be?  Woodmen needs help and is lore-heavy, I think that's the best candidate for an invented defensive hero.  Dwarfdom's best defensive hero (stat-wise) already has two hero versions.  There's three 2/5 dwarves, but Bombur is already in Lore and Gimli has two versions -- I would love to see a lore Dori hero, which I think would be sentinel if ever made.  There's a bunch of 2/4 dwarves not in Lore (Nori, Balin, Dwalin, Thalin), but one is invented and one died in Moria. Gloin's a defender in Leadership, but has poor defensive stats and would not be a defender elsewhere.  Plus with the possible exception of Bilbo-carrying Dori and the ineligible exception of Balin, none are as prominent in the canon as Dain.  (Gimli is so prominent that he would get a third version if any dwarf did, but so far only Aragorn has met that hurdle.) I think Bofur is the best bet for a brand new dwarf defender since he lacks a hero version -- both his ally versions are terrible defenders, but that doesn't mean much.  Ithilien Rangers are concentrated in Lore, but Faramir, Mablung and Damrod are most prominent and already have hero versions; Anborn is probably next most prominent and doesn't have a hero version.  Dunedain could use a first-class defender more than anybody and has reasonable representation in Lore.  I'm also expecting a new Eastern tribe to be in the next cycle if they go East instead of dipping down into Mordor, as I hope/expect.\n\nEdited May 20, 2019 by dalestephenson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3705347","commentId":3705347,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1558361344,"content":"> 19 hours ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> Will Radagast really be better than Denethor for defending?

And with Bard, Son of Brand it is not so hard to bring off-sphere attachments out.\n\nBard is great for off-sphere attachments, but Bard himself is off-sphere to LoDenethor and Radagast, and if you're going off sphere to bolster defense (which you pretty much are required to do in any sphere except monoSpirit with spBard) you can just include tactics or leadership normally.  If you're looking to set up a multiplayer Super Defender, then LoDenethor (prior to the ABB nerf) has an advantage over LeDenethor and Radagast fully-loaded because he can do G. Shield/Ancestral Armour/ABB combo without a prerequisite card (Song of Wisdom for LeDenethor, Diligent Noble for Radagast) -- but you can't do it anymore, and you still need sentinel + readies, and you could start with a bunch of other more sturdy defenders in the first place, etcetera.  Bilbo might be the best pre-errata Lore super defender just because of Fast Hitch.\n\nPost-errata and outside the super defender role -- say as the primary defender in a solo deck or even in a two-deck fellowship, I like Radagast better than LoDenethor.  Two more threat, but that's a negligible factor in defender quality.  Ancestral Armor is great, but so expensive, setup with G. Shield/ABB seems more likely.  Once setup, that gives an advantage to LoDenethor in that 5/3 is better than 4/4 defensively.  But it's not enough (in my mind) to offset being able to survive a 6-strength attack *before* getting a Shield on.  In Lore itself the defensive options are the same for both, of course, and the healing favors the higher hp hero.\n\nBut the biggest factor in my mind is their respective abilities.  LoDenethor's ability is blocked by defending, while Radagast's ability is compatible with defending.  And especially solo, Radagast's potential to quest for 2 for a resource (or free, once he gets his staff) and still defend looms large for me -- as does the prospect of guaranteed card draw with the Wizard Pipe + Messenger Raven (or ETH).  Radagast can defend + help you elsewhere.  Denethor can defend at the expense of not being able to help you elsewhere.  Now to be clear, the synergy and anti-synergy of their abilities with defense don't affect the defense *itself* unless you're using Protector of Lorien, it's just the reason that I think Radagast will be more attractive than LoDenethor in a splash-Lore-primary-defender role.  I think Radagast is going to be good fun even (or especially?) outside an Eagles deck.\n\nOne other point in the favor of Radagast as a defender is that his staff can be used to return a (non-unique) enemy to staging.  In general that's not optimal behavior, but it *does* mean that he can prevent an attack as needed, and that's a handy thing for a defender to have in his back pocket (unrestricted attachment, can only go on Beregond).  It can also be used to play Loyal Hound for free, and that's also a handy thing to have around for a hero defender.  I think that outweighs Denethor's ability to benefit from out-of-sphere events like For Gondor!, Behind Stone Walls, and Gondorian Discipline."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3705668","commentId":3705668,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1558385549,"content":"Thanks for your insight.

I would write that as less defence favours healing.\n\nYes, in one deck Denethor's ability is dead useful, when he's not defending.  I've not played LoDenethor with SpBard/Tactics, but I've played him a lot in the Beorn's Path lineup of Theodred/LeAragorn/LoDenethor.  There I rely on 3x Dunedain Warning for defense, though Ancestral Armor would be nice in the deck -- Steward typically goes on LoDenethor and he uses Rivendell Minstrel to fetch Song of Kings, so resources aren't much of an issue.  I'd guess I end up scrying at about 50% of the time, since getting rid of enemies quickly doesn't always happen in leadership/lore mix, using with Tactics it might be less defenses.  If mixing with spirit, UC can up the scrying considerably.\n\nWhether the 3 threat differential makes a difference is quest-dependent -- most quests it doesn't matter much, but Journey Down the Anduin has that hard 30 -- but not necessarily for Radagast!  If you find his staff (and that would be worth mulliganing for) he doesn't have to defend the Troll at all until you're ready to take it down, just keep popping it back into staging -- with only 1 threat, that won't hurt you much and take as long as you want to prepare.  Since his staff is neutral, you can play it on turn one if either it or Word of Command is in your opening hand.\n\nHealing favors the high hp hero only in the sense that (if you can heal it), it allows you to have a larger *consistent* defense.  If you can fully heal, you can absorb a (Def + hp - 1) attack each turn.  So for example, with plenty of healing and no boost to defense, Radagast can take a 6-strength attack *every turn*, and Denethor can't take it at all.  But that's really only with dedicated defending heroes and it takes a lot of healing -- for questers/attackers spot healing enables low hp heroes to stay alive indefinitely, even the 2 hp hobbits, so you aren't paying in threat for hps you aren't likely to need."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3705764","commentId":3705764,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1558393465,"content":"Can't Radaghast only return a non-unique creature to the staging area?

So I predict a lot more defense coming to lore now with the ABB errata.\n\nWe'll see.  If we consider LoAragorn and Rossiel not being that good at defending, the only good hero defenders in Spirit are Dain and Beregond, both originally released in other spheres and with abilities that tie them to spirit -- and Frodo who has terrible defensive stats but makes up for it by being indestructable.  But it's true that after starting Lore in the core set with the best defending hero and the only attachment that can increase defense, there's been hardly any help for defense (Cloak of Lorien) or even hp (Ent Draught).  The one thing it does have aplenty that's useful to heroic defenders is healing, and it nearly has a monopoly on that.\n\nSpirit on the other hand has a bunch of events that increase defense -- but except for the hideous expensive and little used Light the Beacons, they all are in Angmar cycle or later.  It also has four attachments that boost defense or cancel damage, though two of those are in the last two packs of the current cycle.  So while Spirit's support over Lore for defense (ignoring healing) is massive, it's actually a fairly recent development and concentrated in packs with the borrowed top-flight defenders.\n\nIf you step down from the top-end defensive heroes borrowed from other spheres, I don't think Spirit has a massive advantage over Lore in the hero department -- Lore's heroes tend to be a bit more sturdy without giving up defense to spirit.  Bombur isn't going to be on anyone's list of excellent defensive heroes, but it's still what he does best -- Eleanor's best stat in defense, but is so fragile in a sphere without healing.\n\nI hope you are right and the developers were just waiting for the ABB nerf to rain Lore-ish defensive goodness down upon us.  But I'm not confident myself -- I think Leadership and Tactics covers the defense for the sake of defense, and Lore are only going to get defenders if it is connected with an ability associated with the sphere, as has been the case with Spirit (and was the case with Rossiel, the last Lore hero to get an explicit defense-boosting ability)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3706115","commentId":3706115,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1558448144,"content":"> 17 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Yes, in one deck Denethor's ability is dead useful, when he's not defending.  I've not played LoDenethor with SpBard/Tactics, but I've played him a lot in the Beorn's Path lineup of Theodred/LeAragorn/LoDenethor.  There I rely on 3x Dunedain Warning for defense, though Ancestral Armor would be nice in the deck -- Steward typically goes on LoDenethor and he uses Rivendell Minstrel to fetch Song of Kings, so resources aren't much of an issue.  I'd guess I end up scrying at about 50% of the time, since getting rid of enemies quickly doesn't always happen in leadership/lore mix, using with Tactics it might be less defenses.  If mixing with spirit, UC can up the scrying considerably.\n\nToday I remembered a very useful artifact for Denethor: the Palantír.

I do not consider this an ideal solution as it nets you one card less and Legolas questing for 1 is really poor without Gimli. That being said Magic Ring raises threat even more, which is counterproductive, so I guess the only usable options are Heir of Mardil + SoG or UC. If you have tons of cash, a Greenwood Archer and Elven-king with Elf-friend get you some extra readies, though the more complicated a combo becomes, the easier it is to fail.

Noldor is just crazy, they crush scenario before The battle master as any chance to be view as OP ... Same for Outlands. When i compare Noldor capacity draw to dwarf, i don't find old legacy of durin totally OP ... just ok and again Noldor continue to be better for this job.\n\nThe comparison with encounter cards has no sense. Blocking wargs was a bug as many other encounter cards. I have no complain with these errata. But i think that nightmare is a better fix than errata (especially for cycle 3).\n\nAnd last, i don't find Ered Mithin cycle amazing. I found it bad for scenario and great for player card.

I would prefer new release that this kind of useless errata. The lack of new content hurt a lot.\n\nI continue to think that Gandalf Hero is OP and Elrond + Vilya also. The best deck with an incredible ratio on NM are with these kind of heroes not the dwarf. And we see errata on dwarf. Outlands with Erestor literally destroyed most of the powerfull scenario. And we see Errata on burning brand.\n\nSo you can find it good for the game. Great designer have done a good job for some people. They do a great job for new mechanich, new player cards (Radagast is a great hero). For errata, i think that the job isn't correctly done by far on player card since the last three FAQ on the game. I ignore player errata since the nerf of Horn of Gondor.\n\nEdited June 17, 2019 by 13nrv"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3722873","commentId":3722873,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1560835236,"content":"I agree.

I'm just curious, do you have a time limit for when errata are acceptable, and beyond that you ignore them, or do you evaluate each errata on a case-by-case basis?\n\nThe Out of the Wild errata came out a long time after the card's release, but nobody complained as it's arguably a buff for the card, so I'm curious if you follow that one or not.\n\nI actually don't disagree with most of your comments. I also think the Ered Mithrin cycle had the best player cards in a long time, while the Harad and Angmar Awakened quests remain my favorite. And I agree that Vilya and Outlands are overpowered, but I can see a good explanation for why that might be intended (Vilya, thematically, should be the strongest attachment in Middle-earth apart from the One Ring, and Outlands were designed for new players to feel powerful without a lot of deckbuilding).\n\nOne thing often ignored in the errata discussion is that we don't have the same picture of the card pool that the developer has. The game is developed years in advance. I wouldn't be surprised if the stuff they are playtesting right now won't even come out until 2021. So it could very well be that Caleb has already designed some more Dwarf cards, but they would make Dwarves way more powerful than the already are, so we are seeing some nerfs to old (and frankly overpowered) cards like Legacy of Durin. In the end, the errata may make room for more design space in the Dwarf swarm archtype that would make them fun to play again (I am tired of that mechanic myself). I would gladly take a hit on a couple cards, regardless of their age, if it allows an archetype to grow and become more interesting to play.\n\nMeanwhile, maybe Noldor and Outlands will not see much development in the coming years, so he is leaving their power level alone (this is obviously all conjecture, as I am not a playtester).\n\nMy point is, if you've been playing this game for the last 5 years, you clearly must think Caleb is a good game designer, and has done a good job of piloting this ship we've all been on. When I see a content announcement, it is easy for me to trust that the new cards will be a good fit for the future card pool, given Caleb's track record. Now, why should the trust in his future vision stop at level of creating new content and not include the adjustment of current content? Who knows better where this ship is headed?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3723619","commentId":3723619,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1560923372,"content":"> 15 hours ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> I actually don't disagree with most of your comments.

Who knows better where this ship is headed?\n\nThe rationale you find for the Outlands could be applied to any archetype, really. Why the dwarf swarm archetype would be different? Plus, the Outlands archetype does the same as a dwarf swarm archetype just faster and better. In your case, more than 25% of the decks you have published in Ringsdb use some sort of outland ally (typically Ethir and Anfalas). I guess you are not tired of this mechanic, but there are people who would like to see an errata on the outlands archetypem because frankly, they are reeeeally overpowered. Shall Caleb errate them?\n\nThe new Elvenking + Galadhrim Weaver combo shall be errated? Because Hama was errated to 3 time per game to avoid recurring events like fient and thicket of spears.\n\nI, my self, am tired and bored of seeing decks with steward of gondor (which you use in about 50% of the decks you have published in Ringsdb), which is one of the most overpowered cards in the game. Shall it get an errata in order to make the game more challenging?\n\nMy answer to all of these questions is No. It is a collaborative game (and I hope it stays like this). There is really no need to make erratas, with the exception may be of those combos that create loops of infinite resources, card drawing and so on, which by the way they are not all corrected, you have a two-deck fellowship that generates infinite resources! Even in this case, a list of suggested erratas, like in Arkham Horror, is a more friendly way to go than an imposed errata appearing in the reprinted cards.\n\nOk, that is but my opinion which is obviously not shared by the developers 😀\n\nAnd yes, I, like you, have full trust on Caleb game design skills.\n\nEdited June 19, 2019 by Yepesnopes"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3724203","commentId":3724203,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1560977038,"content":"> 14 hours ago, Yepesnopes said:\n> \n> The rationale you find for the Outlands could be applied to any archetype, really.

Needed? Worth it?\n\nYes.  Both needed and worth it.\n\nBecause overpowered cards are unhealthy for the game, regardless of whether or not it is competitive. Just by existing, they warp the meta and restrict the design space.\n\nErrata to op cards relieves those restrictions. It makes it possible for the designers to build new cards in the space that got opened up. Burning brand made it so that almost no lore shadow management was ever possible again.  It also made it so that no powerful lore defender could ever be released, because the combo was too powerful. When used, it  often completely trivialized the entire combat phase.\n\nNow, there's room for other lore shadow management, and even room for a pretty good lore defender. The game is now better.\n\nLegacy of Durin allowed infinite card draw. By its very nature, unlimited effects are unbalanced and will eventually find themselves part of an infinite loop.\n\nI'm not saying that all the errata that's ever been done has been right, but I think errata for op cards is important, even in a coop game"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3724926","commentId":3724926,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1561073694,"content":"> 1 hour ago, GILLIES291 said:\n> \n> For Carn Dum it totally is, Burning Brand is essential and we played it dozens of times with different decks and the only thing that worked for us with our card pool was Boromir and Burning Brand.\n\nBut logically this doesn't follow.

I'm sorry if this is the case. But if the game were such that every quest, at normal difficulty, could be handily beaten by a casual player with a limited cardpool, it would take away the fun for many, many more people.

There are over 100 other quests that are not Carn Dum. Some of them are so easy that I get no enjoyment out of playing them. But I don't complain about them. I don't try to argue that player cards should be weaker so that those quests can be played at a difficulty level that I find fun. I just accept that with over 100 quests, not all of them are going to be my cup of tea. So ignore them and play a quest I enjoy.

Look at the second quest from Shadow in the East; Thrors map completely breaks that quest. \n> \n> Thank you Caleb for fixing this broken card and others like the ridiculously overpowered burning brand.\n\nI'm looking athe second quest from Shadow in the East.  If you have Thror's Map (requires playing Lore), you can avoid the following travel effects:\n\n1) Hillside Manor -- random discard from hand\n\n2) City Forum -- raise threat 1 per each resource on it (gets resources only when active location is explored)\n\n3) Side Street -- replacement location from deck added\n\n4) Catacombs -- each discard card from encounter deck, if enemy it is engaged.\n\nCatacombs scales against more players, but 3+ players means location control is already a priority and there's only two in deck.  Side Street seems nasty and is required at game start -- but you advance in the quest by exploring *active* locations -- ensuring another location to travel to next turn can actually help the player.  City Forum's only raises by 1 if you go there first chance.  Hillside Manor just discards a random card.  These are annoying effects that would make packing Thror's Map worth including in a deck, if you're playing Lore, which isn't true for a lot of quests.  But those aren't *remotely* game-losing effects that cause the quest to be broken if you somehow avoid them.  If playing Lore I'd add Thror's Map, but I certainly wouldn't mulligan for it.\n\nNow it's certainly true that Thror's Map is a cheap repeatable way of avoiding travel costs, which is exactly what it was designed to be and what it was long-ago errata-ed to be.  You may correctly say that the existence of Thror's Map reduces the popularity of Strider's Path, or that it precludes a lesser, non-repeatable travel avoider or a more expensive travel avoider.\n\nBut here's the thing -- look at those travel effects again.  Is it worth a deck slot *and* a lore resource to avoid one of those effects?  I don't think so.  Lesser cards are blocked not by Thror's Map because they are lesser, but because they are inherently weak. Thror's Map was a useful sideboard card for literally years; now it is a coaster.  And for what?  So you can rejoice in the moral purity of a quest where a tool is taken away to control what happens?  So you can deprive *other players* of a card you yourself were *never* required to play?  So players with a limited card pool starting the game late in his life -- the people who are currently getting this card that veterans got many years ago -- have one less arrow in the quiver?  So the exciting world of forced travel effects can be opened up for the whopping six remaining known quests, as if there weren't past quests featuring obnoxious \"Forced: when X becomes the active location\" when experiencing travel effects was *actually* \"necessary\"?\n\nI appreciate that the designers have to errata card sometimes to remove \"broken\" combos that a single player could induce in pick-up multiplayer, though I've always advocated that such fixes should be designed to preserve the common usage of a card.  I totally reject the idea that the designers should, years later, deside to nerf non-broken powerful cards to protect the integrity of quests from players.  *That's* what I call bad design.\n\nIf they were going to make it so useless, the least they could've done is attach it to the location when used, so that the woodmen could get powered up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3780953","commentId":3780953,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1568043768,"content":"> 5 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> for the whopping six remaining known quests\n\nI wonder if these reprints are part of some sort of preparations they are making for the \"new iteration\" of the game"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3780959","commentId":3780959,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1568044250,"content":"> 6 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> But here's the thing -- look at those travel effects again.  Is it worth a deck slot *and* a lore resource to avoid one of those effects?\n\nYes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3781209","commentId":3781209,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1568059590,"content":"> 4 hours ago, Alonewolf87 said:\n> \n> I wonder if these reprints are part of some sort of preparations they are making for the \"new iteration\" of the game\n\nVery interesting idea, and perhaps a new core set with some of these cards in it? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294624-different-cards-with-the-new-reprint/?do=findComment&comment=3782244","commentId":3782244,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1568152984,"content":"@dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/]\n\nYou got a little hung up on my example of why the map is too good. Danger in Dorwinion is just one example.\n\nThe map definitely shut down design space because of its existence and it made cards like striders path not as useful. Its repeatable nature and low cost was too good and I have always tried to avoid using it. Why? Because it just isnt that fun to ignore every travel cost in the game with this.\n\nThe Harad cycle brought a lot of locations with forced effects ( as Seastan mentioned) and I believe the existence of thrors map was the reason. \n\nIts still a good card, and certainly not a coaster. Off the top of my head I can think of a few locations that make you reveal a card to travel there.

Despite that fact, for the most part I've very deliberately avoided using it in my decks for The Line Unbroken because it completely negates a core game mechanic and thus gives a really skewed perspective on the quests.\n\nNow, I will be quite willing to use it freely.

I have played with TM plenty of times and I never felt that the card's effects adversely affected my enjoyment of the game, or the challenge offered by the Encounter deck. It provided some welcome theme with an ability that makes sense only if it is recursive. (It's a map; you don't throw it away after using it once!)\n\nThat being said, this is a cooperative game, not a competitive one. If I met someone at Gencon and she/he were playing pre-FAQ Boromir, I might say something to them afterwards, but I would absolutely let them play with the ability as it is printed. The game state where one has to ask \"Which version of [Card X] are you playing?\" is not the result of player dissatisfaction, but, rather, a struggling design process. One could argue that players benefit from the changes with the additional design space that they offer, but I would consider that a paltry return for the maintenance of keeping up with the latest card text. If my play group wants to adopt this interpretation, I will follow suit. However, I'm happy playing it as it was designed.

This card is playable at 1, but with the discard effect should probably only cost 0.\n\nSo in a funny/slightly ironic, I think that the Ancient Mathoms project went from wanting to nerf it to deciding to boost it a little (likely either by having it give the attached hero +1 willpower or reducing the cost to 0)."}]}
