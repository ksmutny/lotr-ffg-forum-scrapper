Which prevents another copy from being put into play.  But as the responses I found never directly addressed the issue I thought it would be worthwhile to ask.  The Gather  Information sidequest now makes it much more likely that multiple copies in seperate decks may show up in a game. So am I right to think that it's truly a one of card through and through?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/173496-black-arrow-and-the-victory-display/?do=findComment&comment=1584698","commentId":1584698,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1429586595,"content":"Hey there,\n\n \n\nIn page 24 of the rulebook, it briefly talks about the status of victory display cards.  At the time of the core set, there were no player cards with victory points, but all cards with victory points are the same when they go to the victory display.  So I don't think that matters at all.  Anyway here is what is reads:\n\n \n\n\"Some enemy and location cards award victory points when they are defeated.  When such a card leaves play, one player should place it near his threat dial to remind the players of the victory points when they are scoring at the end of the game\"\n\n \n\nSo I think it is pretty clear that a victory point card leaves play when dealt with or used in your situation.  So after black arrow is placed in the victory display, it's out of play and you may play another copy of black arrow.  \n\n \n\nHope this helps!\n\nKhamul\n\nEdited April 21, 2015 by Khamul The Easterling"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/173496-black-arrow-and-the-victory-display/?do=findComment&comment=1584701","commentId":1584701,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1429586682,"content":"I would think no more Arrows can come into the game.  But I have never seen anything concrete.  So we're just connecting dots I guess, unless someone has precedent?\n\n \n\nedited 'cuz I just saw Khamul's answer above.  It's a good point!
