Anything that do not target beirn nor ask you to choose an hero, like song of mocking which don't work with the bear.Â \n\nSide quest keep watch is great with beornÂ  basically making him a 2 def hero.Â \n\nentangling nets or the new event that decrease enemy attack and def are very good too.Â \n\nThe house of healing has aÂ similar effect of landoroval.Â Â \n\nWith modern card pool is possible to build around him especially in a lore-tactic deck. Which is refreshing considering that most lore-tactic decks and up to be ent decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/288486-hero-beorn-and-card-effect/?do=findComment&comment=3578528","commentId":3578528,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1546211536,"content":"Yes Vigilant Guard works, great card to put on another hero in the deck and siphon damage away from Beorn.Â  Then heal it off the other character.Â Â \n\nHorn's Cry work well.Â  Last Stand is kind of a fun addition if you plan on him dying at some point during the game.Â \n\nAlso, surprisingly, it has been ruled that cards which add resources to a hero's resource pool will also work with Beorn.Â  So Proud Hunters, for example, works.\n\nAs mentioned above, traps are great, anything which lowers enemy attack and defense values, so Entangling Nets is a nice card for Beorn.Â  In the Shadows can be good if you pair him with the right heroes.\n\nAmbush is good as well, as this prevents damage.Â  Â My favorite Beorn deck uses lore Anborn ally to and hero Damrod to recycle Ambush each turn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/288486-hero-beorn-and-card-effect/?do=findComment&comment=3578724","commentId":3578724,"userName":"Miceldars","timestamp":1546245090,"content":"Ok, thanks.

Cost less target 1 enemy and reduce both attack and defence by two. Better for early game while horn cry is better for mid late game or when surrounded by many low-middle attack enemies.Â  In valour mode is just crazy with beorn.\n\nTou can use raven helm to cancel the damage but it works only on sentinel heroes. Better to slot in 2 or 3 honoured guard. Same cost same effect and more flexible.Â \n\nI had a beorn lore Aragorn deck working fine but now I would pair beorn with thurindir to play a turn 1 keep watch side quest and make beorn an equivalent e def in early game. Damrod would be a nice third hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/288486-hero-beorn-and-card-effect/?do=findComment&comment=3579732","commentId":3579732,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1546389809,"content":"http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Category=Beorn+Support [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Category=Beorn+Support]\nÂ "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/288486-hero-beorn-and-card-effect/?do=findComment&comment=3579775","commentId":3579775,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1546397008,"content":"> 1 hour ago, danpoage said:\n> \n> http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Category=Beorn+Support [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Category=Beorn+Support]\n> Â \n\nWhoa, you are the man.
