Activation of card effect (or any other threat raising) that raises threat\n\n2. Threat is about to be raised, but Forced effect on Favor of the Valar triggers because you \"would be eliminated\" so your threat does not get raised and you \"instead reduce your threat to 5 below your threat elimination level\n\n3. If you cannot \"reduce\" then you cannot fulfill the \"instead\" clause of the card (which we know means you can't use it from prior rulings).\n\n \n\nNow, I am not sure this is intended, but maybe they did carefully word it this way.  Here are a couple small ways they could have worded the card if they wanted it to prevent you from being eliminated due to threat raising no matter what your current threat was at.  I am unsure if the developers chose their words poorly or extremely carefully in this case...\n\n \n\n1.  Forced: When you would be eliminated by reaching your threat elimination level, instead discard Favor of the Valar and set your threat to 5 less than your threat elimination level.\"\n\n2.  [Make it passive effect] When you would be eliminated by reaching your threat elimination level, instead discard Favor of the Valar and reduce your threat to 5 less than your threat elimination level.\"\n\nEdited December 11, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195497-forest-snare-in-carn-d%C3%BBm/?do=findComment&comment=1929620","commentId":1929620,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1449841195,"content":"Yeah I've considered it a bit more.
