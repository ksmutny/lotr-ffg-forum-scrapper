For example in Shadow and Flames you could play Galadhrims Greeting in round 1 with a mono spirit deck and potentially reduce your threat to -6 but thats not the case. I ask this question and got this answer:\n\n \n\nHi Christian,\nYou cannot reduce your threat below 0. I’ll check around and see if it’s been addressed in the FAQ previously, and if not, I can make a note to put that in there.\nCheers,\nCaleb\n\nEdited March 24, 2015 by Crabble"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/138752-threat-below-0-official-answer/?do=findComment&comment=1504366","commentId":1504366,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1427219944,"content":"I'm [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/54498-threat-reduction/]\n\nPretty [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/78309-threat-below-0/]\n\nSure [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/842151/negative-threat]\n\nIt [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/72674-negative-threat/?hl=%2Bnegative+%2Bthreat]\n\nWas [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/74223-negative-threat-any-official-answer/?hl=%2Bnegative+%2Bthreat]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/138752-threat-below-0-official-answer/?do=findComment&comment=1504430","commentId":1504430,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1427221650,"content":"> I'm [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/54498-threat-reduction/]\n> \n> Pretty [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/78309-threat-below-0/]\n> \n> Sure [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/842151/negative-threat]\n> \n> It [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/72674-negative-threat/?hl=%2Bnegative+%2Bthreat]\n> \n> Was [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/74223-negative-threat-any-official-answer/?hl=%2Bnegative+%2Bthreat]\n\n \n\nNone of these threads contain official answers.
