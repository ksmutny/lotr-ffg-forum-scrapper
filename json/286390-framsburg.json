If there was a four player game running dale (king of dale), silvan (o lorien), noldor (to the sea, to the sea), and rohan (spirit theoden), playing this card basically means everyone puts a 3 cost ally in for free. Even at the cost of no questing that seems too generous.\n\nOf course, I don't know if this technically stacks with some of those because they have minimums.

And if you feel like it, ready the attached hero also, I guess.\"\n\nYou will put this in a deck which knows what card is on top of the deck.  Gandalf, Imladris Stargazer, Gildor.  Or, you will just fill your deck with 75% attachments.\n\nThen, you will get a free attachment nearly every round.  Let's say you get a minimum of 5 within a single game (assuming you are putting this card into a deck which makes sense, which you ARE doing, because you understand deckbuilding).  That's minimum of 5 resources, assuming you're paying for 1-cost attachments, or 10 to 15 resources, if you're paying for 2- and 3-cost attachments.  If you're putting fewer than 5 attachments into play over the course of the game, you didn't build the right deck for this ring.\n\nAll that for the cost of 1 location or enemy-- definitely worth it!\n\nAnd I guess the ring also readies your attached dwarf or something, whatever.\n\nEdited December 2, 2018 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3555199","commentId":3555199,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1543796439,"content":"I say \"this card is not good because there is only few decks who want to play it\".

Guarded is a mechanic with many drawback. You have to deal with another encounter cards, and that is a really big deal to me. They aren't good beginning cards, since it is usually already difficult to dealt with the encounter cards of the setup and the turn 1 while you play only a few ally/equipment.\n\nIn my experience this is not as bad as it seems.  The early game is where my threat is low enough to handle one enemy at a time.  And the threat of location lock is far away.  I more often play them on turn 2 or 3, after having improved my game state a little.\n\nAs for the deck needing to be designed specifically for the guarded cards; My wife and I currently are using two.  She has Glamdring, and I have the necklace.  We built our decks before they were released, but we both do have multiple Noldor discarding effects.  So if we get guarded cards and the staging area is already too intense, they are not dead cards in our hands.\n\nOnce again this is just my personal experience with guarded player cards.  I haven't played any nightmare scenarios with them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3555749","commentId":3555749,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1543852464,"content":"I\n\nIt's too early to really tell but I would expect guarded cards to be similar to player side quests.\n\nThey simply are not an option against some scenarios but totally fine in most.
