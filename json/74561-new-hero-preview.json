His art is a huge improvement, first off. I also really like the mechanic of him only inspiring Gondor ALLIES. Boromir impresses his people but he's not someone to impress the likes of Aragorn or other heroes. That fits really well, thematically, for me. Also the fact that he needs resources to do it adds a hint of corruption to the ability (to my mind) which is, again, perfect for Boromir. Finally all those Guard(s) of the Citadel will see some play!!!\n\nI also really enjoyed having some insight into the design process. Especially compared to the the other ideas, the Battle and Seige keywords really are an elegant mechanic to add to the game! I love that instead of adding something extra to the game, they're using the pre-existing structures of the game (questing and location exploration) in a unique and thematic way!\n\nI'm so freaking stoked for this now, even if I have to wait until after Thanksgiving for it!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74561-new-hero-preview/?do=findComment&comment=726085","commentId":726085,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1353418394,"content":"I can see the thematic nature, which is nice (like Boromir v1)\n\nright now, I think this card is pretty mediocre, because of the very limited range of Gondor allies out there, although obviously, we'd expect to see that grow a lot over the next cycle.\n\nBiggest disappointment about this, is the fact that it pretty much guarantees no Faramir hero in the box (I assume it's two heroes again, and they've already spoiled Beregond) typical big brother hogging the limelight."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74561-new-hero-preview/?do=findComment&comment=726088","commentId":726088,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1353418877,"content":"More Magali sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif] .

Also, take a look at the Envoy of Pelargir--it's essentially a 1/1/0/1 for 1 resource in a Gondor deck. If you're using Boromir (which you are), it's 2 attack for 1 resource.
