Sometimes it is better to concentrate on killing enemies in play at the start rather than questing. Threat is just one of the \"resources\" you are managing. Also, Eowyn is vulnerable to nasty treacheries when questing alone. I'd generally rather rely on allies for supplying most of the questing power."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77861-i-started-to-hate-eowyn/?do=findComment&comment=751401","commentId":751401,"userName":"Cutievalkyrie","timestamp":1358821639,"content":"Very creative idea.
