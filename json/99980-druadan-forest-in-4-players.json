Playing the two players, and for four players is a big difference. \nBesides, only the player who plays Elrond may play a card without resources. rest of the players without resources get stuck with cards on his hands. \nSo as I said - these tips may help a little, but still I could not ever get further than the stage 2. In addition, 4 cards are revealed every turn + sometimes surge - that afflict players mercilessly by all ways. And even with 3x Warden Of The Healing does not keep up to heal the wounds in 12 Heroes + Allies , and Archery,  put on characters many wounds ,every turn. For 4 players is it a brutal quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99980-druadan-forest-in-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=995756","commentId":995756,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1393353423,"content":"Seems we're not playing this week as one of the guys fell sick.\n\nThanks for the tips though.

I am seeing that the real combat here is in staging, so you need cards that manipulate locations from staging (Asfaloth, trackers), and combat enemies from staging (trackers-bow, hands upon the bow, hail of stones...). Locations are more easy if you reach to play the player cards, enemies is more dificult because when you need trigger the event you dont have resources (and trackers-bows are slow to play all they)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99980-druadan-forest-in-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=996959","commentId":996959,"userName":"Glowwyrm","timestamp":1393444537,"content":"If you have Voice of Isengard, I would bring along Legacy of Numenor and maybe Saruman.  Precious resources for all your heroes and the ability to exile a nasty location/enemy for a turn.  I think this is one quest where everyone at the table can stomach four threat for the resources. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99980-druadan-forest-in-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=997098","commentId":997098,"userName":"camacazio","timestamp":1393452974,"content":"Well of COURSE Ancestral Clearing sucks, everything we know tells us that you shouldn't go stomping around somebody's ancestral clearing.

Also, Denethor has been the champion of the quest for me, especially in combination with Strider's Path (for nasty locations) and Expecting Mischief (killing immediately the Thief, and getting rid of his surge, and the Drummer, reducing the threat considerably; which is half of the enemies you will get).

And that advice my friend works in all languages ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nWith heavy heart, I am inclined to agree that the play-testing must have been very poor for the cycle. I really do not want to sound ungrateful as I totally love the game but I cannot imagine taking two of the Second Breakfast decks (though I, again, like the entries very much) and have a decent chance against some of the quests here. And whether I am a talented player or not, I have been spending a lot of time on the game these past three years, so I should have enough experience in its execution.\n\nI do have high hopes the Ring-maker cycle will be much better in this regard, though.\n\nEdited March 19, 2014 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99980-druadan-forest-in-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=1018351","commentId":1018351,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1395243477,"content":"> Yes you die by the second round most times.  I got to the third round once and thought I was a hero....wrote  a thread on it way back when\n> \n>  \n> \n> It was extremely apparent that the whole heirs of Numenor cycle (including the deluxe base) were not play tested for 4 players at all\n> \n>  \n> \n> Glaurung,\n> \n>  \n> \n> Some advice my mate!\n> \n>  \n> \n> When you don't KNOW, don't speak\n> \n>  \n> \n> You look much more intelligent that way.

I am not saying you will pull a win, but I am interested if it can be at least an improvement. Scouting the encounter deck can help, direct damage in combination with it, crazy willpower provided by one of the four (plus some decent willpower heroes in some of the others), and perhaps warden of healing somewhere as well. I think Legolas or someone for Hands Upon the Bow, and Hail of Stones are great to cut the Hunter before his archery is applied. I do not have much time for it now, but if you cannot, I might have to do it myself.\n\nEdited March 20, 2014 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99980-druadan-forest-in-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=1019502","commentId":1019502,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1395300247,"content":"> I have Elrind and Glorfindel as the basis of one of the 4 decks\n> \n> You don't actually get much of a chance to play allies Glaurung\n> \n> It's all over very quickly\n> \n> Same goes for Into Ithilien 4 Player\n> \n> Just craziness\n> \n> Do you remember you yourself once talked about playing a 4 player game and you were astounded at how the synergies of the encounter cards could just pile on and defeat you ?\n> \n> This is that x 10\n> \n> However.

You can put allies into play as well not only you need to play them all the time……Sure is not easy anyway….. But heal  is a key and put allies also is  and use all your resources every round….. But there is some nasty cards like a locations (no gain resources) can lock you……….. \n\n \n\nAnd remember the time when i make Leadership/lore deck and won all almost all quest without any problem. But this time majority on this forum was sure you cannot make a successful  deck without spirit and Test of will….. That why i start to make my video to show people is possible…….\n\nAnyway i don't have any chance to play 4 players since in Bangkok we don't have some many players……we lucky when we can play by 3…… maybe octgn? But i have a mac so also no chance……."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99980-druadan-forest-in-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=1019708","commentId":1019708,"userName":"Troymk1","timestamp":1395323214,"content":"Glaurung  If you have the room you can do it yourself.  To tinker my decks to being ready to hand to people, I play 4 Player Solo.
