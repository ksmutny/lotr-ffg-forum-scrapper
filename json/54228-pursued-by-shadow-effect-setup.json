You are stuck with it, whenever it comes out. Imagine having a starting threat of 27-28, this card shows up and now you got the Hill Troll on the first turn. If you don't happen to have Sneak Attack and Gandalf on hand, as an emergency measure, you are in a heap of trouble. The only positive is that there is one less card in staging waiting to cause trouble. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54228-pursued-by-shadow-effect-setup/?do=findComment&comment=537378","commentId":537378,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1317810723,"content":"This was exactly my situation :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] threat 28 to begin with, Pursued by Shadows = threat 31, HELLO HILL TROLL!
