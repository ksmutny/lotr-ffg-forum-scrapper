The core rulebook says that raising our threat occurs during the refresh phase, and shows a player action window between raising our threat and the end of the phase. So according to the rules, the first line on Barad-dur doesn't actually do anything. We should all still be raising our threat by 1 each turn on top of the +X threat from the Forced effect.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/267179-barad-dur-timing/?do=findComment&comment=3161823","commentId":3161823,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1515517240,"content":"If we had Facebook reactions to posts, I would have had a \"sad\" react instead of a \"like.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/267179-barad-dur-timing/?do=findComment&comment=3162086","commentId":3162086,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1515528317,"content":"Another instance of a card whose intent is clear, but which doesn't really jive with the rules as written. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/267179-barad-dur-timing/?do=findComment&comment=3162394","commentId":3162394,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1515537267,"content":"Isn't the end of the round and the end of the refresh phase the same moment?

This is why you literally cannot grief someone by Desperate Alliance'ing them Erestor in the refresh phase, even if they wanted to be griefed.\n\nEdited January 10, 2018 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/267179-barad-dur-timing/?do=findComment&comment=3164620","commentId":3164620,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1515649580,"content":"> On 1/9/2018 at 2:34 PM, NathanH said:\n> \n> Isn't the end of the round and the end of the refresh phase the same moment?

Everything that triggers at the end of the refresh phase triggers before the end of the round. The end of the round and the beginning of the round can be thought of like book ends to the game round and each phase therein.\n> Cheers,\n> Caleb\n\n "}]}
