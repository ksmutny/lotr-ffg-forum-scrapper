Plenty of FFG characters spread through the other three spheres and even the classic book characters appear in Spirt/Tactics, but currently we have not one leadership female character. So for fun what would you design one as? Who would she be?\n\n \n\nGaladriel is a great leadership choice and another version of her would be interesting, especially one that focused on her magic and power. Dunedain could make for some interesting characters as well.\n\n \n\nMy thoughts:\n\n \n\nElena\n\nMinstrel, Noble, Noldor\n\n9 Threat\n\n3 Willpower\n\n1 Attack\n\n1 Defense\n\n3 Hitpoints\n\nResponse: After you play a card with a Song trait, ready a hero you control or add a resource to Elena's resource pool (limit once per round).\n\nSetup: Search your deck for a Song card and add it to your hand.\n\n \n\n \n\nOr\n\nGiselle (or whatever generic name you want)\n\nDunedain, Warrior\n\n8 Threat \n\n2 Willpower\n\n3 Attack\n\n1 Defense\n\n3 Hitpoints\n\nRanged\n\nResponse; after Giselle participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, add one resource to her resource pool."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305059-leadership-female-hero-ideas/?do=findComment&comment=3880528","commentId":3880528,"userName":"RogueSeventeen","timestamp":1580189753,"content":"Starting with a song is a great ability and could totally open up another sphere not shared by your heroes. \n\nAlso I think Amarthiul is a female Leadership Hero.  I play her? all the time and she's fantastic.\n\nEdited January 28 by RogueSeventeen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305059-leadership-female-hero-ideas/?do=findComment&comment=3880546","commentId":3880546,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1580195681,"content":"> 1 hour ago, RogueSeventeen said:\n> \n> Starting with a song is a great ability and could totally open up another sphere not shared by your heroes. \n> \n> Also I think Amarthiul is a female Leadership Hero.  I play her? all the time and she's fantastic.\n\nNah, he's a dude.
