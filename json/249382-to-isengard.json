However, you should be able to manipulate that resource with certain card effects, like Parting Gifts, which doesn't specify that the resource being moved must belong to a hero under your or any other player's control: Action: Move any number of resource tokens from a leadership hero's resource pool to any other hero's resource pool.\n\nFinally, a captive can leave play if it is killed.  There is one or maybe more cards in the scenario that places damages on a captive.\n\nIncidentally, I believe you can heal a captive card with a card that does not specify that the character being healed be under a player's control.  So Warden of Healing should work.  \n\nEdited May 10, 2017 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249382-to-isengard/?do=findComment&comment=2780354","commentId":2780354,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1494451013,"content":"To add to GrandSpleen response:\n\n \n\nThe only card i see that can get a captive killed is Grishnakh [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Grishnakh-ToS] by his 2nd forced effect.\n\n \n\nAlthough there is only one of this card in the whole encounter deck."}]}
