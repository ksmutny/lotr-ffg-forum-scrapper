To play an ally from hand, you must pay that ally's cost during the planning phase. That is the only time you can trigger Gloin's response.\nCheers,\nCaleb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83612-gloin-and-sneak-attack/?do=findComment&comment=795093","commentId":795093,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1368464493,"content":"legolas18 said:\n\nThat's true Dam, there are already official rulings to all this.
