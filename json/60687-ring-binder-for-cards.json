I am sure there is one out there with the clear plastic A4 sleeves . Each sleeve can hold a dozen or so cards. Im fed up of rubber banding them together in the box, it would be great to scan through a binder and pick out my deck that way. Does anyone know of such a product out there?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60687-ring-binder-for-cards/?do=findComment&comment=596246","commentId":596246,"userName":"BiJay","timestamp":1329708114,"content":"Do you mean these: www.amazon.com/Ultra-Pro-3-Ring-D-Ring-Collectors/dp/B000C0V9EE/ref=pd_bxgy_sg_img_b [http://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Pro-3-Ring-D-Ring-Collectors/dp/B000C0V9EE/ref=pd_bxgy_sg_img_b]\n\nYou could also buy normal ring binders in every stationer and then buy one of those:\n\nwww.amazon.com/25-Ultra-Pro-Protectors-Baseball/dp/B000PWZU4E/ref=pd_sim_sg_2 [http://www.amazon.com/25-Ultra-Pro-Protectors-Baseball/dp/B000PWZU4E/ref=pd_sim_sg_2]\n\nwww.amazon.com/Ultra-Pro-9-Pocket-Trading-Pages/dp/B00095M5DQ/ref=pd_sim_sg_1 [http://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Pro-9-Pocket-Trading-Pages/dp/B00095M5DQ/ref=pd_sim_sg_1]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60687-ring-binder-for-cards/?do=findComment&comment=596254","commentId":596254,"userName":"Ted Sandyman","timestamp":1329710090,"content":"Yep that is perfect.
