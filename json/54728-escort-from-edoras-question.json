So Escort from Edoras can be used to commit and add 4 Willpower once and then is discarded after the quest resolution step of the questing phase.

At cost 2 he is easier to bring back with Stand and Fight and you won't feel too guilty discarding him to use Ride to Ruin to get rid of a pesky location.
