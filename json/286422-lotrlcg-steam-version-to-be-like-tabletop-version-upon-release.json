Magic Duals is fairly complex I would assume and it's free.\n\nI do agree that LOTR has some very complicated rules though.\n\nEdited November 19, 2018 by Stewart777"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286422-lotrlcg-steam-version-to-be-like-tabletop-version-upon-release/?do=findComment&comment=3540779","commentId":3540779,"userName":"PigsAreOurEquals","timestamp":1542656443,"content":"> 4 hours ago, Stewart777 said:\n> \n> But surely a dedicated group of software developers could achieve this.

Yes technically almost everything can be done given enough time, manpower and other resources.\nPractically there needs to be a large enough market potential for any company to even consider doing it. Magic has a lot more players so you can spend a lot more and still break-even. Free-to-play also has a business model behind it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286422-lotrlcg-steam-version-to-be-like-tabletop-version-upon-release/?do=findComment&comment=3541612","commentId":3541612,"userName":"Hannibal_pjv","timestamp":1542712467,"content":"Yeah...
