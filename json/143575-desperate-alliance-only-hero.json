The hero chosen by Desperate Alliance is still in play and will return to your control at the end of the phase.\n\nSo what happen if I engage one ennemy, where goes the undefended damages ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/143575-desperate-alliance-only-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1523903","commentId":1523903,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1428006522,"content":"I presume the enemy will place no damage, since there is nowhere to place it... and no rules to direct that damage elsewhere."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/143575-desperate-alliance-only-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1523920","commentId":1523920,"userName":"Courchevel","timestamp":1428007342,"content":"Let s say a four player party with one guy playing a solo hero going hammer stroke + desperate alliance, then dwarven tomb or book to replay desperate alliance each turn would work fine ...
