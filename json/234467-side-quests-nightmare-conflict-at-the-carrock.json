If the designers were to errata this card, I'm pretty sure they would change \"current quest\" to \"main quest\". For me, if I played CatC Nightmare and then used side quests to \"stall out\" the main quest by redirecting that forced progress token, I would feel like I was cheating and like I didn't really \"earn\" that win. So it's up to you: play the card as written (where you could place the forced progress on the side quest), or play the card the way the designers intended it, and the way they will probably errata it at some point (where you can't avoid that forced progress on the main quest)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234467-side-quests-nightmare-conflict-at-the-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=2498121","commentId":2498121,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1478879120,"content":"The nihgtmare version is almost impossible (in solo) without side quests anyways, so it's better to stall for a bit."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234467-side-quests-nightmare-conflict-at-the-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=2498399","commentId":2498399,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1478890451,"content":"Interestingly enough, I was hoping the progress would go to the main quest; I'm trying a strategy where I fish out the Battle side quest and try to keep it in play indefinitely so I don't have to do standard questing very much.\n\n \n\n> As written, it's pretty clear: the Conflict at the Carrock Nightmare card would place that progress on the current quest, and you get to choose what the current quest is.

The rules say \"the first player may choose one to be the “current quest” until the end of the phase\", emphasis mine. By the time you're in the Travel Phase, or the Combat Phase, the main quest has become the current quest again. I didn't realize this either until we started discussing it in this thread -- but unless Core Set Legolas is attacking during the Quest Phase, he's going to be putting his two progress tokens on the main quest, not on a side quest.\n\n \n\n> It's not so clear to me, actually.

It feels like an inflection point that could go either way.\n\n \n\nI think this is a case of two simultaneous effects, in which case the first player gets to choose which one to resolve first, and you could choose the resolution order that's most advantageous to you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234467-side-quests-nightmare-conflict-at-the-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=2499104","commentId":2499104,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1478959732,"content":"Did not interpret it right also!
