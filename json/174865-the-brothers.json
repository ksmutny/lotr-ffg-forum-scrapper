As many of heroes experienced a release of a nice copy as a ally, like legolas, gimli, faramir, boromir to name a few I got strong hope that elrohir and elladan will have their chance. It would be great especially for solo players like me, as a skill limitation prevent me from playing elrohir especially to often, and it's a hero with a lot potential .

But not too probable I think.\n\nThere are way to many named characters in this part of the book to give them all a card.\n\nThat, and I think the box will focus on strengthening Gondor, so I'd expect some Gondor allies. (and not outlands!)\n\nAnd finally, in the box they might skip out on the quest with the grey company, as we already have the quest, sort of, in PoD form.\n\nSo while possible, I think not probable."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1603728","commentId":1603728,"userName":"szuler","timestamp":1430646396,"content":"Yes, it's good ovecourse that certain cards are realised to match certain notion of the story in campaign , but I thing it's Importend that main personas in lotr world deserve a hero and ally version , order not importend ( like haldir - after a great ally card , got a hero with cool thematic skill and great artwork).

For the stats, you have a relatively low starting threat, and you have two Leadership resources ready to play Steward of Gondor on Elrohir from the first turn. Not the most thematic, I'll grant, but this card is essential for turning him into a super-defender. Ally Faramir also works well in this deck, so that it becomes powerful at questing in the mid to late game. This is also important so that you don't have to quest with Elladan and can use him as your attacker. As long as you don't care as much about theme Errand-rider and Tactics Bofur are very helpful as well. It might be a fun experience to include Weather Hills Watchman, Signals and Gather Information in this deck. That is a variant that I have been meaning to try at some point. So many new cards... not nearly enough time to try them in old archetypes. It's a wonderful problem to have.\n\nEdited May 5, 2015 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1606237","commentId":1606237,"userName":"OlorinCZ","timestamp":1430806878,"content":"I made a deck with Leadership Aragorn and it worked very smootly (although samowhat depending on steward, which I try not to use that much anymore ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ).
