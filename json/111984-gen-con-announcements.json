But anyway, let's get straight to the topic.\n\n \n\nDo you think that at Gen Con there will be a new announcement regarding new deluxe expansion for LotR or anything else that has not yet been announced?\n\n \n\nWhy do I think this way?\n\n \n\nI checked all the news for LotR and came to this conclusion:\n\n- Khazad Dum, Heris of Numenor and Voice of Isengard were all announced in August or September (2011, 2012 and 2013).\n\n- At that time 3 or 4 adventure packs of the matching cycle were released.\n\n \n\nSo what do you guys think? It would really be awesome if we would get info on a new deluxe expansion (Northern kingdom would be awesome). Despite all this, I very much doubt we will se anything new. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111984-gen-con-announcements/?do=findComment&comment=1174687","commentId":1174687,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1406627992,"content":"Not sure..
