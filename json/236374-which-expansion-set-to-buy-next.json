I play exclusively single player (may try two handed on some harder quests).\n\n \n\nI'll be starting Dwarrowdelf soon but want to plan my next purchases ahead of time. Really prefer to buy the whole cycle at once so I can play the quests in order and gradually add cards to my decks.\n\n \n\nI am on Journey to Rhosgobel, on my fourth failure but came within one of healing the eagle last try (funny I had an easy time of the Carrock, and beat it more than once).\n\n \n\nCan I skip ahead to Dream Chaser or Sands of Harad (I don't mind buying this one not all at once) and expect to be able to succeed with my available card pool? I was planning on skipping Against the Shadow at least for a cycle (or Hobbit saga....if it were more easily available) anyways.\n\n \n\nThanks for any help."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236374-which-expansion-set-to-buy-next/?do=findComment&comment=2530334","commentId":2530334,"userName":"Otherworlder","timestamp":1481089599,"content":"Dwarrowdelf has a slew of powerful cards; you are not going to be doomed facing modern quests.

We played with two decks and we nearly beat the ruins of Belegost (maybe it was an illusion but I def had the feeling we managed to give the quest a serious go). So I actually felt, you could build fair decks with just these few boxes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236374-which-expansion-set-to-buy-next/?do=findComment&comment=2530513","commentId":2530513,"userName":"CommanderDave","timestamp":1481110444,"content":"I found the Ring-Maker Cycle to be a lot of fun.

Good to hear that the newest releases won't be insurmountable with what I have. I'll probably just get into the newest stuff then and buy the older releases as they get reprints easily available.\n\n \n\nReally wish I had known of this game a long time ago.

I suppose I could do that better with a dwarf deck, but it wouldn't fit the theme.\n\nI've started playing Arkham Horror LCG which is more solo-friendly so far, but then I only have four scenarios.\n\nEdited December 11, 2016 by Hawkstrike"}]}
