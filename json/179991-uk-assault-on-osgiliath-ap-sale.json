Pack is still all sealed etc brand new.\n\n \n\nAmazon UK has it at £11.46 posted (or £9.67 if you spend over £20) and ebay right today has it at £12(posted) and online shops are out of stock.\n\nSo £10.50 including postage seems fair, anyone want to take up the offer? Payment via paypal.\n\n \n\nIf anyone is interested then either pop a post on or a PM please. If no takers I will likely go the ebay route.\n\n \n\nCheers\n\nAlex"}]}
