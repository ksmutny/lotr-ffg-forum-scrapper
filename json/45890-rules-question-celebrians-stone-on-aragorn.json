Gaining +2 Willpower for a low cost in a great boon. Sure it is restricted and unique but that probably won't be an issue in a mono-leadership deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45890-rules-question-celebrians-stone-on-aragorn/?do=findComment&comment=460032","commentId":460032,"userName":"CrowOfPyke","timestamp":1303919889,"content":"Apophenia said:\n\nCabelos said:\n\n \n\n\"If attached hero is Aragorn, he also gains a Spirit resource icon.\"\n\nIf I am playing a solo Leadership sphere game, what exactly does this do for me?\n\n \n\n \n\nNothing unless you have Spirit cards in your deck. Aragorn's resources could be used to buy Spirit or Leadership cards. However I will say that effect is incredibly useful when creating a Spirit/Leadership deck using Aragorn. \n\n\n\n \n\nExactly.  I have used the FFG tokens for this game - red for Tactics, blue for Spirit, green for Lore, silver for Progress and then some generic non-FFG purple wooden cubes for Leadership.  I have taken to using gold FFG tokens for Aragorn since they could be used for Spirit or Leadership when he has Celebrian's Stone on him.\n\n \n\nI use small 10mm 6 sided dice to track damage."}]}
