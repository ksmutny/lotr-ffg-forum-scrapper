At that time we would anticipate that moment to come so soon. With 2 packs of the presumed last cycle spoiled for the most parts, we only have about 50 mystery cards left. So would like to know what you think should be addressed in terms of player cards ( EXCLUDING HEROES). I will try to settle for a Top5 but feel free to do a Top 10 or Top5 per sphere if you feel the need.\n\n \n\nI am an elf guy, so don't be suprised:\n\n1. Good non-unique Noldor questing ally preferably Lore or Spirit: while I consider most unique Noldor allys to be great, I cannot say the same for the rest. I like the Guardian of Rivendell and obviously the Stargazer is great but in non-sailing quests the upkeep of the navigator is steep for non-Erestor decks.\n\n2. Good Noldor ally in Leadership: I really hope they make the Gildor AP the Noldor AP. Right now I not see many compelling reasong to play leadership with Noldor. Erestor is good (nowadays a bit overcosted) and I guess the Warden can work but there is just not much more. A great toy for Gildor and an ally with stable-potential would go a long way.\n\n3. Lore weapon for Silvan: Forged has gone a long way to help Noldor to get weapons on Glorfindel and their other heroes. Silvan should also get some help here as they have two green heroes that would benefit greatly from a +2 attack weapon. It could even have a cost of 2. \n\n \n\n4. /5.Green/red silvan events: We still miss 2 for the collection. It would be cool if the green one was for interacting with the victory display or healing. Red one could be stat-boosting.\n\nHonorably mentioned: Ally Aragorn. Sphere would not matter, but as we will likely get Spirit Aragorn hero, this won't happen. \n\nDunedin support: Just 2-3 true difference-maker would be great.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3786156","commentId":3786156,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1568636641,"content":"Neutral ally aragorn would be great!\n\n \n\nUsual stat line with hp down to 4 or 3, a decent ability and a cost of 3.\n\nEdited September 16, 2019 by Halberto"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3786241","commentId":3786241,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1568643464,"content":"1) Honestly, I would prefer ally Aragorn over a spirit hero version. Is there any reason to believe, we will get spirit Aragorn anyway? Additionally I would like more allies of important characters like Éomer, Éowyn, Théoden, Frodo, Fatty, Gríma, Beregond, Targon, Bergil, Dáin Ironfoot etc.\n\n2) Furthermore, I would like to see some way for dwarves to become ranged, like a Throwing Axe attachment, or a ranged dwarven ally. Dúnedain Signal or Elf-friend plus Rivendell bow is unthematic.\n\n3) Some dwarven healing would be nice as well. Sure they have a lot of hitpoints, but I do not like to always rely on Wardens of Healing for that task.\n\n4) Extra cards for Isengard/Doomed could enable a Isengard deck to work.

Since he's mentioned on Lothiriel's card, I think we have a decent chance of getting him. I would love to see ally Aragorn for A Knife in the Dark and Flight  to the Ford, though Vigilant Dúnedain does a decent job of representing him. We don't yet have any ranged hobbits, and thematically we kind of need them for a Scouring in the Shire scenario (hopefully next year's PoD, as a fitting close to this iteration of the game).\n\nThe Rohan trait could use some love. If we get another Rohan hero, I'd love for it to be Grimbold, who was known for his valour and was an important commander at the Fords of Isen and at the Pellinor Fields (and who could accompany Gandalf and Erkenbrand in a reinforcements deck for Helm's Deep). I'd also like another hero version of Sam, if it's comparable in power to Leadership Sam (the option to switch spheres without changing heroes during the campaign can be helpful). I recall seeing new art for Sam a while ago: that might be full art for this year's fellowship event (we should get details soon, right?), or a new Sam hero. Assuming Gildor shows up in this cycle, we only have three heroes unaccounted for (likely Tactics, Spirit, and Lore).\n\nIncidentally, I really enjoyed using the Fellowship contract (as well as the new Merry and Pippin allies) for Journey in the Dark, and it definitely helped the Nine Walkers. I wonder how many contracts we'll get. The product page for Wrath and Ruin says that it contains \"three copies of each new player card,\" while the product page for The City of Ulfast doesn't say that, and mentions that it contains a new contract. I'm excited to see what rules the new contracts bend or break.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3806425","commentId":3806425,"userName":"RegisF","timestamp":1571132464,"content":"Don't if it was mentionned, but we have a barely full set of items which grant an other sphere when they are attach to Aragorn, except in Lore sphere."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3806440","commentId":3806440,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1571136175,"content":"> 1 hour ago, RegisF said:\n> \n> except in Lore sphere.\n\nActually the Ring of Barahir [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Ring-of-Barahir-TSF] from The Steward's Fear does exactly that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3806441","commentId":3806441,"userName":"RegisF","timestamp":1571137049,"content":"And it's a willpower item not a lore item. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3806490","commentId":3806490,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1571145860,"content":"> 2 hours ago, RegisF said:\n> \n> And it's a willpower item not a lore item. \n\nOh you meant an attachment which naturally belongs in Lore, not one that grants the Lore icon.

That being said, there are two themes I think could still use some love: Rohan and Dunedain.\n\nFor Rohan, while The Muster of Rohan is already a step in the right direction, I think the Mount theme within Rohan is still not visibie enough. It would be really cool to have a Mount attachment that could go on allies, so you could run more Mount cards in a Rohan deck and get more value out of flavourful cards like Charge of the Rohirrim. I would therefore love to see the following cards:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Gárulf (Unique)\n> Tactics Ally (3 Cost)\n> \n> 1 Willpower / 3 Attack / 1 Defense / 2 HP\n> \n> Rohan. Warrior.\n> \n> At the end of the round, discard Gárulf from play.\n> \n> Response: After Gárulf enters play, search the top 10 cards of your deck for a Mount attachment and put it into play.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Hasufel (Unique)\n> Spirit Attachment (2 Cost)\n> \n> Mount.\n> \n> Attach to a Rohan character or Aragorn. Restricted.\n> \n> Response: When attached character leaves play, attach Hasufel to another eligible target instead of discarding it. Then, exhaust Hasufel.\n> \n> Action: Exhaust Hasufel and deal 1 damage to attached character to ready attached character and give it +1 Willpower, +1 Attack and +1 Defense until the end of the phase.\n\nSince it's highly likely that the hero in the last pack will be Spirit Aragorn, I think the above cards would fit in nicely in terms of lore and mechanics. Speaking of Spirit Aragon, I would love for him to be as follows:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Aragorn (Unique)\n> Spirit Hero (12 Threat)\n> \n> 2 Willpower / 3 Attack / 2 Defense / 5 HP\n> \n> Dunedain. Gondor. Noble.\n> \n> Sentinel.\n> \n> Reduce the cost of the first ally you play each round by 1 for each Trait that ally shares with Aragorn (to a minimum of 1).\n\nThis is supposed to represent Aragorn after the events of the Return of the King when he is crowned King of Gondor. I think his change in traits reflects that, and his ability also signifies how he is able to potentially bring all races and factions together. It's also nice support for Dunedain decks, whose allies are notoriously overpriced.\n\nTo play into the high cost of Dunedain allies, and to represent their elite status and versatility on and off the battlefield, I would also love to see the following card:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Northern Veteran\n> Leadership Attachment (2 Cost)\n> \n> Skill.\n> \n> Attach to a Dunedain ally. Limit 1 per character.\n> \n> Action: Exhaust Northern Veteran to choose an attribute (Willpower, Attack, Defense). Add attached ally's printed cost to its chosen attribute until the end of the phase.\n\nI think this helps make some of the Dunedain allies feel as powerful as they are meant to be, plus it rewards you for playing those high cost allies in the first place. Additionally, it makes Dunedain decks worth playing without having to fit in 10+ cards just to keep enemies engaged to trigger all their abilities, as this card is reward enough on its own.\n\nI think a lot of these cards would thematically fit the last pack of this cycle so I actually have good hope that some of them are printed in some form or another. At the very least it would make sense that we would get some final Dunedain support if Aragorn is indeed the last hero.\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts!\n\nEdited May 3 by Fantasty"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3933954","commentId":3933954,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1588525216,"content":"Love them.

I tried to let this one synergize with the Sam ally while still being useful on his own:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Frodo Baggins (Unique)\n> Spirit Ally (2 Cost)\n> \n> 2 Willpower / 0 Attack / 1 Defense / 2 HP\n> \n> Hobbit.\n> \n> Response: After you raise your threat, exhaust Frodo Baggins to add 1 resource to a Hobbit hero's resource pool.

I think I will follow your advice and design the quests first and maybe develop the story a little bit. I'm worried because my story telling pales in comparison to Tolkien and the creators of this game. It's certainly much easier to immerse oneself in deck building and see what it missing and just fill in the gaps.\n\nHowever, in messing with the woodland realm/wizard quests this week, I am a bit motivated to try and build synergizing encounter decks. So it might be worth starting with that and building the story around it or in conjunction with it. \n\nI figured there might be some individuals here that would love to jump in with this too, if they are interested. \n\nOf course as I see more ideas here and come up with my own, I think I will continue adding to the Google Sheet 🙂\n\n \n\nBy the way, I really enjoyed play testing your Light in the East quests. I still need to play #3 and #4, the quarantine has prevented my friend and I meeting to play (and I havent figured out why the OCTGN files don't work), but it will be a blast to finish it up.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3944169","commentId":3944169,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1590411553,"content":"I think you can find storytellers on those forums quite easily, just create your own thread! 🙂"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300107-top-5-player-cards-you-still-want/?do=findComment&comment=3944382","commentId":3944382,"userName":"pmdoug","timestamp":1590452407,"content":"I would love some Tactics cards that offer reliable readying outside of the combat phase.

I don't see why Tactics shouldn't offer at least 1 in-sphere repeatable ready that doesn't relate to attack and defense. At this point in the game's lifespan I actually find it stranger that this hasn't happened yet. I'm not asking for a universal ready like Unexpected Courage, but some way to consistently ready a hero would be great. It could be limited to warriors only and I'd still be happy to have it. \n\nI understand that there are some neutral readying options, but I was specifically talking about the lack of tactics readying. "}]}
