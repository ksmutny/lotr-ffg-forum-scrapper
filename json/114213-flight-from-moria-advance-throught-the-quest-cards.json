If you explore a quest card from Flight from Moria (like Heading Up, for example), the new quest card ir face up or you put it face down?\n\n2. If you exhaust a hero with Tools engaged in refresh phase to place a progress token on the Escape from Darkness but there is an active location, can you do it anyway?\n\n3. New Devilry: when you change the quest card, the new is faced up or not?\n\n \n\nThanks\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114213-flight-from-moria-advance-throught-the-quest-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1216188","commentId":1216188,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1408612194,"content":"1. always face down before face up.
