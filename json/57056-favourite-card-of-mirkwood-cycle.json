There are so many powerful, thematic cards that also happen to have outstanding art.\n\nIf forced, though, I'd probably go with Gildor Inglorion. Awesome stats, intriguing ability, and fantastic art. Anything by Magali Villeneuve is top notch, but this particular piece is especially impressive. \n\nHonorable Mentions: Support of the Eagles, Ride to Ruin, Prince Imrahil"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57056-favourite-card-of-mirkwood-cycle/?do=findComment&comment=563150","commentId":563150,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1322847844,"content":"Richsabre!

I've loved that picture since the preview all those months ago, and to finally have it there when I played the scenario last weekend was fantastic! I have yet to actually beat the scenario, but can imagine, having made it past all those beasties and through all those tantrums, finally getting back to Thranduil's halls and flinging the miserable little wretch on the stones. \"There's your grubby little imp! Quite the merry chase you led us on too, you little devil!\"\n\nAhem.\n\nHaldir is a very pretty card as well.

I'm breaking it into several categories, because there are too many cards I love. \n\nMy inner Bilbo likes Radagast. I like telling tales of the further adventures of the sometimes-hapless Brown Wizard.\nMy inner Pippin likes a card I don't own yet. Support of the Eagles, my deck is itching for three copies.\nMy inner Boromir likes, well, Boromir.\n\nI have to give honorable mention to my Favorite Quest: Journey to Rhosgobel. As a big Eagle fan, I love the chance to save one's life. It's kind of irritating that if the eagle has 1 damage on it out of 20 HP, you lose at the end, that irritates my inner Bilbo. Still my favorite.\n\n\nIf we are allowed to include the core set in our considerations, I will switch my Bilbo/Pippin/Boromir choices to Eowyn/Steward/Gimli. difficult to use together in a deck, but my favorites.\n\nFavorite Shadow card: Nazgul of Dol Guldur. When that thing hits the table, my blood chills and I can almost hear the Nazgul scream from the films. I lose shortly afterwards, but that doesn't ruin the magic of the moment."}]}
