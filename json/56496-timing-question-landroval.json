Landroval already had 2 damage and was exhausted. Bilbo was also exhausted. Both got killed by the card effect, so I discarded the two of them. I thought for a while if it would have been possible to discard Bilbo and to use Landroval's reaction to get Bilbo back in play. I dismissed this idea though, as Landroval is already dead in the moment in which I want to use his reaction.\n\n \n\nSo, did I for once play it right, or did I punish myself again needlessly?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56496-timing-question-landroval/?do=findComment&comment=557880","commentId":557880,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1321765254,"content":"Yep, when something deals damage to multiple characters, all deaths occur at the same time, so Landy can't use his Response."}]}
