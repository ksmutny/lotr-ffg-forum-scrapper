Also, the requirement of questing comes pretty late in the sentence.  Since that is the initial requirement, I think it should get noted first. Maybe something like \"While Thalin is committed to the quest, deal 1 damage to each enemy revealed before resolving any of that enemy's card effects.\"\n\n \n\nMuch prefer your version of Horn of Gondor than what we have now - and Steward for that matter.   I like all the \"choose a player\" cards you've changed that used to only effect the first player.\n\n \n\nDwalin (spirit) I'd change the wording to \"If that enemy is destroyed before the end of that phase\" instead of \"until\". \n\n \n\nI'm curious - what is your reasoning for rewording all the doom guys to have printed doom and a response that cancels it?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236256-lotr-lcg-rework-project-v10-release/?do=findComment&comment=2529706","commentId":2529706,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1481061028,"content":"Thanks for the typo - fixed it and added it to the queue.\n\n \n\nGleowine - I aim to breathe life into Song fluff any way I can :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\nGuarded Ceaslessly - this is more of a matter of balance and viability than fluff. The unncessary fiddliness is the thing I tried to remove from this card. Exhausting characters every turn to rid a location of it's threat, and at the rate of -2 per character... There is just better location control available. I wanted to keep it relevant, while retaining the theme as much as I could, which I did by implementing the Scout/Ranger exhaustion cost.\n\n \n\nAs for Thalin, I took the wording out of Don't Be Hasty (an official card), and with that wording in my opinion a player would be able to tell by himself if Crows surge or not when Thalin kills them, without going to forums or sending a rule question to the developers.\n\n \n\nYeah, I don't get that whole first player dependency. Why? It's a co-op game, why those effects should be tied to a specific player that changes every turn? Choice gives a room of breath to planning and strategy.\n\n \n\nShort answer? The Seeing-stone event. Long answer? Any future potential card that might reference a card with a Doomed keyword."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236256-lotr-lcg-rework-project-v10-release/?do=findComment&comment=2529826","commentId":2529826,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1481064521,"content":"Awesome.  Thanks for the details and all the effort into this.  It would definitely bring a lot of cards out of the box/binder/coaster status if we had these.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236256-lotr-lcg-rework-project-v10-release/?do=findComment&comment=2530127","commentId":2530127,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1481077291,"content":"For Son of Arnor, since abilities trigger sentence be sentence, I think the +engagement cost has to come before the engagement itself if you want stuff like Sam to trigger.
