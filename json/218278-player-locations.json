A card like ranger summons comes with out of play copies of location encounter cards which are then shuffled into the encounter deck when the card is played. I believe this is the best option. In fact, I am a bit surprised it hasn't happened yet. Flavor seems problematic, since it disrupts the sense of place, but you can make generic type locations like \"hiding place\" work.\n\nLocations in a player area that give buffs are just unnecessary because we have attachments. You can even have attachments on player threat dials. I don't think locations would add anything new or unique in that way.\n\nIt also seems to me that player card side quests essentially achieve much of what you are looking for in locations already.\n\nThe one thing that I would like player added locations (as described above) to do is allow players to travel to more than one location as in some scenarios like Battle for Laketown. Having multiple active locations is probably the most neglected aspect of the game and it could make effects that put progress on the active location meaningful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218278-player-locations/?do=findComment&comment=2186077","commentId":2186077,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1461622831,"content":"Introducing a new card type (player locations) will be hard, as no encounter deck has a way to remove/handle player locations, if they are not in the staging area. Therefore I would go with your option one.\n\n \n\nYou could let players directly play locations into the area (like traps) or Shuffle them into the Encounter deck and have them Pop up randomly. The first way is stronger, but ballance will be a huge Problem anyway...\n\n \n\nWhat effect should/could a Player Location have? Negative threat doesn't seem a good idea (even if the Location is unique). Usually the encounterdeck wouldn't remove Locations for you and if you have a benefit from it you wouldn't either so it will stay there for ever. In other words ist 2 willpower the encounterdeck can't do anything against (exept it boosts the threat of all Locations, but that doesn't happen to often). Any Lasting effect will have the same Problem (for example: +1 to a stat or ressource boosting etc.). As this new Locations are very likely to not leave the game they would have to cost very much or have very litle of an effect, both not that great. So I agree a Player Location should give a benefi when explored.\n\n \n\nSo if a Player Location only gives benefits when explored i isn't to different from Player sidequests! Sidequests are more or less what your first Option proposed. Obviously side quests delay your game by a turn where Locations wouldn't nessecarly, so Locations would have a lower power Level, but in the end the difference doesn't seem great enough to justify their creation for me.\n\n \n\nLast Note: If you create Player Locations you surely wouldn't want to leave out unqiue Locations like rivendell for example. In Terms of Story it seems odd that heroes might go from cair andros to rivendell and back in 2 turns^^ And yes I know that a Party of Eowyn, Elrond and Thorin questing through Gondor is as odd as my the rivendell-journey.\n\n \n\nTL;DR: Playerquests are more or less what you suggest\n\n \n\nEdit: Looks like DukeWellington shares many of my thoughts, but writes a little faster :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218278-player-locations/?do=findComment&comment=2186096","commentId":2186096,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1461623448,"content":"Hate to be a hater, but I've always disliked how in this game we never actually see the most important (i.e. good) locations of the books like Rivendell, Minas Tirith, etc. MECCG, in my opinion had a much better grasp at representing locations than this game ever did and probably ever will, thanks to the basal structure of the game (that is, locations are encounter and thus \"bad\" cards)\n\n \n\nA while back I created a sort of variant similar to your second idea.

The Encounter keyword was so shamelessly botched it's not even funny. I always thought that if they ever make Tom Bombadil and Goldberry player cards, they should have the Encounter keyword and some song events to shuffle them in. Can't believe they didn't do that in the Eriador cycle.\n\n \n\nDoomed is a similar case. A deluxe/cycle centered around Isengard with a storyline about the craft of ring-making, with the theme completely absent from the player cards and Doomed ending up ina bunch of random allies and events?

The cardtext (except traits) is concidered blank and allies at Locations can not quest, defend, attack or be targeted by any other playercard effect than that od the Location they are at (read: you can only use them to trigger the Location). Obviously the allies are in Play (so you can not have 2 Arwens; one in Rivendell and one in your Party)\n\n \n\n3. You may pay the cost of an ally at a Locationand remove him from that location. If you do so consider, him being played from your Hand. Exhaust that ally. (I think you should have the Option to move an ally to your Party. To symbolize the journey it takes from a Player Location to your questparty he has to exhaust, so you have to consider if you want to use an ally you can only Play next turn now for your Location and then wait a turn for him or pass up on your Location for a next turn Play.\n\n \n\n4. Any Encounter Card effect that Targets allies, also Targets allies at Locations. (I think this is important. This way the encounterdeck still can screw your Locations without the Need of Encounter Cards directly designed fot that matter!

Shuffeling in \"nice\" Locations could be a way to bring it back to life.\n\n \n\nI think it works perfectly with the havens Gizlivadi posted.

Allowing only yourself to put allies at alocation is reasonable, too.\n\nImmunity to encountercard effects or not is a tricky question. Getting Beorn first turn to soak up damage is an Overall boon for you, but it can backfire too! All treacheries that scale with the amount of allies you Control also get worse. I just have the Feeling, that you shouldn't be able to be 100% sure an effect won't be punished by the Encounter deck (attachment/allie hate, loosing ressources etc.). Te only way I see to give every quest the possibility to do something against your haven is to destroy/discard the allies you have there.Imagine you are forced to discard an ally, but except for boern at your haven you just played attachments and saved your other ressources, you would get nothing from Beorn!\n\nKeep in mind, that you loose all effects expensive/high health allies may offer (at least what I think should be the case) if you put them at a haven and you can't \"cheat\" them into Play (sneak attack/elfstone etc.). I would say pros and cons are at the same Level."}]}
