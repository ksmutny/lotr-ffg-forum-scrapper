And you have to put the images in yourself. Either by capturing them with the camera or you can import them from you desktop and then import them into the CW. It's a bit of a work but afterwards it pretty cool :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I know another that only uses the CW to do the encounter deck. This way he gets to play with the cards AND get an easy solution to managing all the different encounter decks and use them.\n\nPersonally I didn't feel for taking a picture for every single card I own so I went for a better and quicker result. I took the images from the lackeyccg LOTR LCG plugin. You can do it from the octgn files too but the quality of the pictures aren't as good as the lackey ones. Can hardly read the text on the quest cards.\n\nBut bear in mind, only use the images of the cards you own! Else it's piracy.\n\nEdited August 3, 2013 by mr.thomasschmidt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87749-play-on-an-ipad/?do=findComment&comment=830416","commentId":830416,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1375545534,"content":"How long did it take you to create a single deck and a single quest?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87749-play-on-an-ipad/?do=findComment&comment=830472","commentId":830472,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1375550002,"content":"The timecomsuming job is to get the cards into the CW.

Same when setting up for a quest. One of the advantages here is that when you have set up a quest you would like to play, you can save the game. So if you loose you can just load the game and start over. No need to start setting it up again. Of cause you should save before you do the final quest setup as read on the cards ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87749-play-on-an-ipad/?do=findComment&comment=835072","commentId":835072,"userName":"Nyck","timestamp":1376056979,"content":"Oh, thx.

Yes, it works. It's some work at the beginning, but afterwards its ok. It definetely has to be improved. Here is a review:\n\nCardWarden is a little program for card freaks, who want to have their own cards on their ipad to play on the go. It's kind of octgn on a tablet but still very limited. There are no games preinstalled, you have to import and built your own games. It is just a sandbox, but it still has to improve to be really satisfying. Once you understood how to get your cards into the database and how to play with them the fun starts. There is no alternative out there i know of, so i hope CardWarden will be upated.\n\nCard Warden has all the basic functions that a card board game simulater needs to have. You can import your own cards by importing image files, or you can just photograph them with your ipad camera to get them into the system. Cards are stored into virtual boxes, where they can be arranged in different card decks.\n\nThen you can load these decks and play with your cards the same way you would do on your kitchen table. The program allows you to tap cards move them around on the board, add tokens, etc. Even a dice roll can be simulated if you need one.\n\nThe \"playing with your cards\" part is nicely done, i managed to fulfill a quick round with my living card game.\n\nI think the basics are there, but CardWarden has to improve the import and card management system a lot. I had problems to understand how to get the images right, photographing the card backs and fronts. I wish you could do this more flexible. Changing the image of a card is almost impossible and very frustrating. You can not delete a single card, but only all of them. The card management is way too limited and needs to be improved a lot!\n\nSth important: it is single player only. There is no network play with your friend.\n\nEdited August 11, 2013 by Nyck"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87749-play-on-an-ipad/?do=findComment&comment=837158","commentId":837158,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1376280951,"content":"lackeyCCG for iPad is done... an is just waiting for the apple gods to approve it (yet another reason why andoird owns) and this it will go live.

Over a year ago I asked eagerly when it would be done and the message I got then is the same as I got about two month ago. \"It's done. I only wait for getting it approved by Apple. Shouldn't take more than 3 weeks\" So I will get excited WHEN it comes. Until then I'm not taking Travors word for when it MIGHT come. And I'm not yelling at you booored :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'm just very disappointed in the way Trvor has handled this. He's a great guy but it doesn't take over a year to get something approved by Apple(slow as they might be). So either it wasn't done when he said so or he just hasn't really been paying any time to fix what wasn't approved. And that's called giving your fans false hope.\n\nAlso OCTGN has announced an update, again almost a year ago, that a near future version will be cross platform. As in being able to be played on iPad.\n\nBut where CardWarden is the strong one is in the card importer. I'm totally dependent on either Tragic to update the lackey plugin frequently. Or some other guy to update the octgn plugin. With CW I can do it all my self.\n\n@nyck And just write your suggestions on the comment line.

Now that you break it down in this way it does seen very easy to update. Which is a good thing. Cause what I meant by being dependent on you to update wasn't about the time it coul/would take before you updated it. Simply meaning that if you for instance quit the game for good some day, then we are dependent ion someone else to take it up which might never happen.
