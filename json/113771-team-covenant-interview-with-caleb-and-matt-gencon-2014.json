Especially when they talk about how to revisit Moria and the Balrog while still keeping it fresh; it seems it'll be quite different from Shadow and Flame, maybe the Balrog's appearance will be designed to be a \"surprise\".. Also I liked when they talked about the upcoming boxes, how they decided to go to Angmar for the next cycle and how they designed the new saga boxes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113771-team-covenant-interview-with-caleb-and-matt-gencon-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1209313","commentId":1209313,"userName":"Mich the One","timestamp":1408373001,"content":"Thanks for posting, cannot wait to get home and watch.\n\nEdited August 18, 2014 by Mich the One"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113771-team-covenant-interview-with-caleb-and-matt-gencon-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1209652","commentId":1209652,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1408380627,"content":"It's really a treat to see \"behind the scenes\" a little bit, I'm very thankful for Team Covenant.
