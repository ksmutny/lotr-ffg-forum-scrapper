My guess would be that the ability is tied to the card itself. If Landroval used his ability then later left play, the new card played should be able to use the ability as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59073-landroval/?do=findComment&comment=580478","commentId":580478,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1326751097,"content":"That was my impression as well, but I believe the 'once per game' limit is about the Hero, not Landroval.\n\nStill, there is the problem about card memory. If it is limited by each Landroval, returning him to your hand would mean that his ability should be able to be used again. I can't see anything in the FAQ nor official nor unofficial. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59073-landroval/?do=findComment&comment=580483","commentId":580483,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326751961,"content":"This is one of those questions that should be confirmed. The card rule says nothing about other cards with the same name. So, to me, it reads that you can use this abilty 3 times, if you play 3 cards. The \"ability is used\" cross the \"in play rule\" as after the ability triggers he gose back in your hand. Dose this ALSO count for the graveyard?\n\nThe answer is (for me) that the YES you play 3 cards, you get 3 effects.\n\n BUT, I've been playing this game for a while now and I would bet this means playing from the graveyard with Stand and Fight dose not reset the card and also that the effect is global to all copies of the card... even though there is NOTHING in the rules to say this is how it is.\n\nPublish [../../../edge_public/img_edge/spacer.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59073-landroval/?do=findComment&comment=580491","commentId":580491,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1326755431,"content":" Landroval returns to your hand as part of the use of his ability.  Suppose you then play him again.  How does the game know if that's the same copy of Landroval, or a second copy you've had in your hand?  It's gotta be that each player can trigger Landroval's ability only once per game (although I bet each player could do so once), otherwise there's no reasonable way of enforcing the limit.\n\n \n\nBTW, this explanation should be in the FAQ, but it does track similar restrictions in AGoT, which has usually been helpful in untangling some of these rules issues."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59073-landroval/?do=findComment&comment=580500","commentId":580500,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1326758876,"content":"Considering that he is returned to his owner's hand as part of his ability, I think it's pretty clear that the \"once per game\" restriction means exactly what it says: as a controller, you get to trigger that effect once--and only once--per game. Otherwise, the restriction would be completely meaningless and would have no impact on gameplay. In other words, there's no reason to print \"once per game\" if the card's own ability would allow you to break that restriction. So, no matter how many times you manage to play Landroval over the course of a game, you only get \"The Landroval Save\" once.\n\nMore interesting to me is the question of whether multiple players can each trigger their own respective Landroval effects (at different stages of the game, of course). I'm actually not sure, and I can see arguments in favor of both interpretations."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59073-landroval/?do=findComment&comment=580522","commentId":580522,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1326767275,"content":"radiskull said:\n\n Landroval returns to your hand as part of the use of his ability.  Suppose you then play him again.  How does the game know if that's the same copy of Landroval, or a second copy you've had in your hand?  It's gotta be that each player can trigger Landroval's ability only once per game (although I bet each player could do so once), otherwise there's no reasonable way of enforcing the limit.\n\n \n\nBTW, this explanation should be in the FAQ, but it does track similar restrictions in AGoT, which has usually been helpful in untangling some of these rules issues.\n\n\n\n100 % agree.There is no doubt about it and dont need even bother Nate with this question....."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59073-landroval/?do=findComment&comment=580591","commentId":580591,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326781653,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nradiskull said:\n\n \n\n Landroval returns to your hand as part of the use of his ability.  Suppose you then play him again.  How does the game know if that's the same copy of Landroval, or a second copy you've had in your hand?  It's gotta be that each player can trigger Landroval's ability only once per game (although I bet each player could do so once), otherwise there's no reasonable way of enforcing the limit.\n\n \n\nBTW, this explanation should be in the FAQ, but it does track similar restrictions in AGoT, which has usually been helpful in untangling some of these rules issues.\n\n \n\n \n\n100 % agree.There is no doubt about it and dont need even bother Nate with this question.....\n\n\n\nwell, we all agree on this... that isn't the point..\n\nThe point is that the rules do not make it clear.
