Do anybody play this on a regular basis?)\n     \n     * 4-handed (!? ditto)\n   \n   * Multiplayer\n     \n     * 2 Players\n     \n     * 3 Player\n     \n     * 4 Players\n     \n     * 2 player two-handed\n   \n   * Keeping count variant\n\n * Deck construction:\n   \n   * Thematic open (no thematic concerns, both in terms of player card and quest type e.g. eagles in Moria)\n     \n     * Unlimited (all the card pool)\n     \n     * Progression style (only cards released at the time of quest first release)\n     \n     * Cycle style (only cards from Core + relative Deluxe Espansion and AP cycle)\n     \n     * Progression/Cycle style (only cards from Core + every Deluxe and AP release up to that point)\n     \n     * Bear's draft\n   \n   * Thematic\n     \n     * Strictly thematic: only cards that fits Tolkien's Lore\n     \n     * Loosely thematic: some unthematic addition are tolerated for gameplay reasons\n\n * Campaign:\n   \n   * Saga Campaign\n   \n   * Banania's campaign\n   \n   * Basic campaign?

Some people refuse to play things like outlands or the Gandalf hero or Spirit Glorfindel or Boromir decks or Hama feint recyclers because they consider those to be OP like cheating. Other people are entirely comfortable with breaking the game. In fact, that is their goal. Some people play for self expression, like deckbuilding is their artistic medium. Others play for the story, others play for puzzle solving, and still others are not players as much as collectors who like having a complete set of everything (including alternate art and play mats)."}]}
