I think Dunhere is probably better then Glorfindel mainly so that you can avoid the problem you mentioned.

So Starting Threat 30 winning in 5 turns with a final score of 45 = 195, while ST 30 winning in 20 turns (probably even more than that in this case) and final score of -9 = 591 lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] ."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48227-9-on-passage-through-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=488206","commentId":488206,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1308569536,"content":"I just got a score of -9 with Bilbo (printed), Dunhere and Eowyn. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] In multiplayergames I prefer a good, swift victory, but today I wanted to try the \"low-threat\" tactic on p. t. mirkwood.\n\nWhat was your deck, scottindeed?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48227-9-on-passage-through-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=488556","commentId":488556,"userName":"GhostWolf69","timestamp":1308624957,"content":"Weeks said:\n\nI sincerely hope that FFG will rethink the scoring system before tournaments are launched for this game.\n\n\n\n \n\nI second this.

Removing the card from game (i.e. not back into the Encounter deck) if you didn't finish the quest \"in time\".\n\nThat way you could not hog down on points like this until you got them all. Instead it would encourage players to finish the Quest as fast as possible right after killing a \"scoring\" Enemy.\n\nThen again... it does add to the \"pure luck\" part of it all... but like previously mentioned this cannot be escaped anyhow since the scoring card might just as well be discarded as a Shadow Card.... so I don't know if this would make it worse.\n\nI don't know... just thinking out loud.\n\n/wolf"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48227-9-on-passage-through-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=488573","commentId":488573,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1308629715,"content":"GhostWolf69 said:\n\nWeeks said:\n\n \n\nI sincerely hope that FFG will rethink the scoring system before tournaments are launched for this game.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI second this.
