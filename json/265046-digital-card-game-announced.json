It's a game where you build your own deck and play solo or co-op in a LOTR universe. You start with 3 heroes, and there's 4 spheres of influence that restrict your deckbuilding. There are enemies, treacheries, allies, attachments, and events.

There were around 100 viewers which is a bit disappointing considering the existing community. But then again many could be at work depending their timezone. \n\nThe game looks ok at the moment. The UI and the card designs are far from finished. The community manager mentioned that this is a pre-alpha phase of the game and that things should look better upon release. FFG is known for its excellent production value in its boardgames. I hope FFI follows. Because at the moment the card desings are so ugly. The Hearthstone format, although it works, is kinda off with the LOTR LCG mechanics. The fonts on the cards (explaining the rules are also ugly). But again, he said that these things are subject to change. The mouse-pointer while he played was standard windows arrow head, which stood out to me. Other games I played like Gwent and Hearthstone usually change it to something that fits the lore. \n\nAnyway, he played a bit (for about 15 mins). The visuals again are meh. The good thing is that every character has voice lines. Not all the phases were there but the game felt very similar to the cardboard version. \n\nHe showed the main menu but he didn't click anything other than play. The menu and its UI is also very raw and unappealing to the eye at the moment. He said that he didn't want to go to the deckbuilder because there are cards that they don't want to reveal yet. He also talked about the favor cards. These cards will be something like \"draw two cards for 0 resources\" for example. \n\nHe said that he will stream every Tuesday and Thursday at 1pm CST revealing more features. And apparently the game goes to Early Access on Steam (only single player for the moment) at 2018 Q1. \n\nEDIT: I should add that this stream was not recorded on twitch but they twitted that the following ones will be.\n\nEdited December 13, 2017 by Muco"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265046-digital-card-game-announced/?do=findComment&comment=3123730","commentId":3123730,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1513173907,"content":"1 pm during the week = most people working and unable to watch.  Oh well.  And is steam a free program?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265046-digital-card-game-announced/?do=findComment&comment=3123736","commentId":3123736,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1513174211,"content":"> 14 minutes ago, Ywingscum said:\n> \n> 1 pm during the week = most people working and unable to watch.  Oh well.  And is steam a free program?\n\nSteam is free but he is only a plateform to access to games. Most games on steam are not free, but this one seem to be free. But you probably have to buy cards either with in-game money (earning doing what the game ask you to do) or with real money. This is an economic model named free to play (free but you may pay to avoid to spend times at doing things or to have bonus).\n\nEdited December 13, 2017 by Rouxxor"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265046-digital-card-game-announced/?do=findComment&comment=3123770","commentId":3123770,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1513175874,"content":"I'm probably not the right person to ask for impressions of the stream, as I was too busy frantically trying to type out a play-by-play for Discord.

The've been showing several things: deck builder, 4 of the 5 adventures from the starter scenario (the last only half of it), they've shown favor cards, anatomy on cards (rarity, level and all the core cards, maybe subject to change), the 4 core heroes...\n\nA bunch of things!

That includes hero packs and cards that can be bought separate. \n\nWhen they decide to show the shop we'll have a better understanding about \"pack format\". Right now we know that it'll be hero packs (one hero and a few player cards thematically linked to that hero/trait) and separate cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265046-digital-card-game-announced/?do=findComment&comment=3168002","commentId":3168002,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1515855488,"content":"I did not meant that some player cards were exclusive via money, I mean this:\n\nRarity is irrelevant when you buy stuff via real money, you buy whole packs of cards.\n\nBut, if you want to buy cards with valor, you buy not packs, but individual cards separately, and that's when \"rarity\" comes in, making different cards cost different valor."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265046-digital-card-game-announced/?do=findComment&comment=3168019","commentId":3168019,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1515856692,"content":"> 18 minutes ago, John Constantine said:\n> \n> I did not meant that some player cards were exclusive via money, I mean this:\n> \n> Rarity is irrelevant when you buy stuff via real money, you buy whole packs of cards.\n> \n> But, if you want to buy cards with valor, you buy not packs, but individual cards separately, and that's when \"rarity\" comes in, making different cards cost different valor.\n\nNope. You buy hero packs with their sets of cards either way.  But there are some cards that are not available in packs, and must be purchased separately (with either valour or real currency)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265046-digital-card-game-announced/?do=findComment&comment=3168203","commentId":3168203,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1515868855,"content":"The rarity thing is very confusing.
