I pre-ordered.\n\nAn important point that seems to be missing from this discussion is that FFG allows you to cancel preorders. That is very considerate of their customers. Better to preorder, wait for more information, and cancel later than to wait without ordering and miss your opportunity. Even if the preorder could not be cancelled,you could always resell."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278123-there-and-back-again/?do=findComment&comment=3381817","commentId":3381817,"userName":"ericniemi","timestamp":1529672910,"content":"Does anyone know when the physical cards would be available?  Is everything available on the August 28th?  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278123-there-and-back-again/?do=findComment&comment=3381845","commentId":3381845,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1529674699,"content":"> 8 hours ago, Kalrhin said:\n> \n> They have not stated that the game will come with the tokens needed to play the game either\n\nWell . . . \"If you're new to the game, this set contains everything you need to start playing The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, including two pre-built player decks constructed from previously released cards, and all the tokens and rules that you need to get started.\"\n\nI think a smart move by FFG would have been to make this an available product, so new players could immediately have what they need to play the digital and tabletop games.\n\nEdited June 22, 2018 by Wandalf the Gizzard\n-"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278123-there-and-back-again/?do=findComment&comment=3382025","commentId":3382025,"userName":"TheSpitfired","timestamp":1529682967,"content":"Is there a good place to get information on the digital version?

They showcase the Art so much better. I'm really not sure what to do, I don't really want to spend $120 or $130 on mostly things that I will not use. Basically I'm getting the alternate art cards, as well as two Adventure Packs, the heroes I'll get soon anyhow. I do think that it's unlikely they will have developed two Quests, given the time it takes to do so, if they don't plan on releasing as print-on-demand later at some point.
