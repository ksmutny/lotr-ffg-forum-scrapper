Do enemies exhaust to attack? I ask this because in the Road to Rivendell scenario, some enemies with ambush attack you immediately when they engage with ambush. Does that mean they attack AGAIN during the normal combat phase? or does the first ambush attack mean they can't attack again on the same turn?\n\n \n\n2. In a 2 player game, if one player dies, and the other remains alive and continues playing, how many cards are revealed from the encounter deck during the questing phase? is it still 2 cards - one per player who started the game, or just 1 card - not counting the player that died anymore?\n\n \n\nThanks for the help!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99870-two-general-questions/?do=findComment&comment=992746","commentId":992746,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1393108179,"content":"1.

Page 22 of the rulebook:\n\n\"Note that after a player is eliminated, one less card is \n\nrevealed from the encounter deck during the staging \nstep of the quest phase, as there is now one less player \ninvolved in the game.\"\n \nAs a result, player elimination is by no means fatal - I've notched a few wins 2P where one has been eliminated.\n \nHowever, if the player is eliminated during staging, you don't reduce the number of cards to be revealed in THAT round - FAQ:\n\"The base number of cards to be revealed is \ndetermined at the beginning of the staging step, and \ndoes not change if a player is eliminated during \nstaging.\"\nEdited February 22, 2014 by jjeagle"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99870-two-general-questions/?do=findComment&comment=992770","commentId":992770,"userName":"Teldil","timestamp":1393110703,"content":"Alright, thanks folks!!!"}]}
