I've been able to find A Journey to Rhosgobel, The Hills of Emyn Muil, and Return to Mirkwood in the U.S. I just ordered The Dead Marshes from a store in the U.K. for about $20, including shipping. The Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at the Carrock are nowhere to be found (unless you want to pay >$50).\n\nScheduled reprints are shown here:\n\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_upcoming.asp [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_upcoming.asp] [select \"Reprints\"]\n\nThe Hunt for Gollum, A Journey to Rhosgobel, and Return to Mirkwood are scheduled for reprints in Q2 2013."}]}
