And it should be easier to design them because with smaller factions you don't have to worry about as many crazy combos. Still… designing is never easy, I guess.\n\n \n\nI like the ideas, I will try to give them more thought later. Skin-changer is a great idea in principle, maybe a bit too strong as it is though?

He is not attacking in uncontrollable fury. I suggest maybe Intimidating Beorning?\n\n \n\nThe third one has a lot of text for someone that is basically a 4-cost, 3 wp, 3 atk, 3 def, 3 hp ally. If you print him with these stats instead of giving him the pluses, he would be essentially the same (of course, there is small difference, but still). Also, he feels overpowered."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182760-beorning-ally/?do=findComment&comment=1696354","commentId":1696354,"userName":"jjenks476","timestamp":1437242124,"content":"Your definitely right about the name for the second Beorning, Intimidating does make more sense.\n\n \n\nYour right printing him with those stats might be more effective, though there are certain encounter cards like in Redhorn Gate and the new Lost Realm quest that could blank his abilities or blank his abilities, I thought this might limit his appeal slightly. Would 2 resources to ready make it easier to justify? or max once per round?"}]}
