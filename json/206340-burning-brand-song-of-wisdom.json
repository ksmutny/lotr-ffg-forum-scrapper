I'm guessing no, but I wanted to double check. Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206340-burning-brand-song-of-wisdom/?do=findComment&comment=2117155","commentId":2117155,"userName":"krokodiler","timestamp":1458630202,"content":"Yes, it can be Attached."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206340-burning-brand-song-of-wisdom/?do=findComment&comment=2117710","commentId":2117710,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1458656692,"content":"Since Burning Brand doesn't require a \"printed lore icon\", you can put it on someone who has simply gained the lore icon.   This works for Songs, Narvi's belt or even Gandalf's ability if you play it from the top of your deck.  It has been clarified that the play requirement of \"Attach to a Lore character\" is only checked at the time you play the attachment.  So even if the Song of Wisdom was later discarded, Burning Brand stays.\n\n \n\n(1.23) Attachments\n\n...\n\nThe “Attach to...” rules text on an attachment is only a play restriction, and is not taken into account after the card is already attached."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206340-burning-brand-song-of-wisdom/?do=findComment&comment=2125475","commentId":2125475,"userName":"lkb57","timestamp":1458949417,"content":"Thanks guys!
