I was just curious because I have been away from the game for a few sets now.\n\n \n\nIt's okay. No worries. I had a good laugh about it.\n\nSo here's a bit more detail on the subject.\n\nIt's hard to use the word \"typical\" because there aren't really enough saga boxes with consistent releases to form a trend. However, one thing that has appeared to be consistent is the announcement of the next saga box. It normally seemed to occur within a month of the release of the prior box.\n\n \n\nRoad Darkens released: 10/03/14\n\nTreason of Saruman announced: 11/03/14 (four week delta)\n\n \n\nTreason of Saruman released: 04/23/15\n\nLand of Shadow announced: 04/30/15 (1 week delta)\n\n \n\nLand of Shadow released: 11/19/15\n\nFlame of the West announced: - It's the middle of March (4 month delta) <--- this is why people are anxious\n\n \n\nHowever, if you look at the Black Riders release to Road Darkens announcement the trend falls apart.\n\n \n\nBlack Riders released 09/20/13\n\nRoad Darkens announced 02/06/14 (4.5 month delta)\n\n \n\n \n\nBottom line, situation normal. We're all just REALLY excited excited for the next box!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205515-return-of-the-king/?do=findComment&comment=2106901","commentId":2106901,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1458186014,"content":"> And me... Except once I saw that the OP wasn't John I tempered my expectations.\n\nI know, whenever an article post isn't by Trololo / John, I get a little suspicious."}]}
