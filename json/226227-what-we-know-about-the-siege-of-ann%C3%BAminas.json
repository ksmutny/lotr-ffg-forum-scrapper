Outland decks were supported by an Elrond deck each for healing and utility (Thror's Map, cancellation, card draw/deck search). Dwarves were all in their own staging area (E). Two players only at each stage also certainly helped reduce the amount of Encounter deck awfulness coming out.\n\nEdited November 14, 2016 by RobOz"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226227-what-we-know-about-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas/?do=findComment&comment=2500746","commentId":2500746,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1479104000,"content":"Our twelve player crushed it the first time, though we were super-careful and took a few hours to complete- a vastly different experience from my Gen Con.\n\nEdited November 14, 2016 by Kakita Shiro"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226227-what-we-know-about-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas/?do=findComment&comment=2501321","commentId":2501321,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1479144545,"content":"> Our twelve player crushed it the first time, though we were super-careful and took a few hours to complete- a vastly different experience from my Gen Con.\n\n \n\nI'd love to see what heroes those teams were running.  \n\n \n\nWe had 4 per team, and in both attempts we lost at either the 5th or 6th turn.  Generally due to threat-ing out in questing.  Those locations with X threat were terrible.  Blanking wounded characters was terrible.  And forcing all of us to engage enemies was terrible.    It was a blast though!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226227-what-we-know-about-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas/?do=findComment&comment=2503370","commentId":2503370,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1479283962,"content":"Mmm.. no more experiences to share?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226227-what-we-know-about-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas/?do=findComment&comment=2504249","commentId":2504249,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1479328430,"content":"I did have a rules question - is there only 1 victory display for the entire team of 12 players - or is it still unique per group?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226227-what-we-know-about-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas/?do=findComment&comment=2504277","commentId":2504277,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1479329276,"content":">  \n> \n> > Our twelve player crushed it the first time, though we were super-careful and took a few hours to complete- a vastly different experience from my Gen Con.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I'd love to see what heroes those teams were running.  \n> \n>  \n> \n> We had 4 per team, and in both attempts we lost at either the 5th or 6th turn.  Generally due to threat-ing out in questing.  Those locations with X threat were terrible.  Blanking wounded characters was terrible.  And forcing all of us to engage enemies was terrible.    It was a blast though!\n> \n>  \n\nDeck-planning spreadsheet is here [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EYheHy4mQyCD6Poi9lHDaHSypYUZm8Y4mpTV2Ar6GwM/edit?usp=sharing]."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226227-what-we-know-about-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas/?do=findComment&comment=2504304","commentId":2504304,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1479330626,"content":"Thanks for that!\n\n \n\nTeam 1, Deck 4: Solo Beregond deck.  Very Brave.   ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]\n\n \n\nI do notice you had Eleanor on each team.  I decided that was critical as well, but only after our two games of getting slaughtered.  \n\nAlso each pod used Spirit Eowyn, also agreed to be critical. \n\nEdited November 16, 2016 by Slothgodfather"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226227-what-we-know-about-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas/?do=findComment&comment=2504319","commentId":2504319,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1479331227,"content":"> Thanks for that!\n> \n>  \n> \n> Team 1, Deck 4: Solo Beregond deck.  Very Brave.   ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]\n> \n>  \n> \n> I do notice you had Eleanor on each team.  I decided that was critical as well, but only after our two games of getting slaughtered.  \n> \n> Also each pod used Spirit Eowyn, also agreed to be critical. \n\nHis entry was incomplete, so I was just going off of memory.

In fact, E/F were this Tactigorn deck [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/3608/anger-management-a-day-of-wrath-1.0] and this Brand son of Bain deck [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/3607/raisin-brand-2-scoops-of-death-1.0]. This table was strongly focused on killing everything and adding progress using Blade of Gondolin, which is a good strategy for every table.\n\n \n\nNone of the other tables had a table-wide cohesive strategy, the eight of us just brought our strongest possible decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226227-what-we-know-about-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas/?do=findComment&comment=2504414","commentId":2504414,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1479335394,"content":"> I did have a rules question - is there only 1 victory display for the entire team of 12 players - or is it still unique per group?\n\nEvery group has its own victory display"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226227-what-we-know-about-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas/?do=findComment&comment=2504554","commentId":2504554,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1479343063,"content":"> Was there any tech in particular (or strategy) that you included for a particular stage?   Such as, any cards you specifically included in one team but didn't require it in the others?  Or was there any strategy into which team took which position? \n> \n>  \n\n \n\nOur stage (E/F) used a very specific strategy which can be read about here: http://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/1600/annuminas-stage-e-f [http://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/1600/annuminas-stage-e-f]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226227-what-we-know-about-the-siege-of-ann%C3%BAminas/?do=findComment&comment=2505163","commentId":2505163,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1479398744,"content":"That is an awesome strategy.
