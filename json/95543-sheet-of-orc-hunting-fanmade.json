The idea is to play it in octgn plattform, or lots of friends print together lots of copies by, for example, printerstudio [http://www.printerstudio.com/]. (The problem is maybe shuffle the decks! <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png] )\n\nPD2: i have tested it several times, and it is very funny! Alone, 2 players, 3 and 4. I have seen it is impossible with normal decks (you can't play allies, only one round because at the end of the round you must discard them), but with specific decks it is much more easy. The most dificult is 4 players, and the most easy is 2 players (or one). You need lots of cards and habilities to return to ready the heroes, this is the question in this scenario. But you learn lots of things here. You learn to use more usually attachments and events. There are useless cards that here are very good. And the most important cards here have the same theme like this scenario (for example, attachments dunedain...). Finally, you become a great heroe to play other combat quests!!! (this is the objective of the quest: gain experience and recognition by your folk :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png] ). Enjoy!!!\n\n \n\nHow about, must i correct any word more in the sheet file? Thanks\n\nEdited December 22, 2013 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95543-sheet-of-orc-hunting-fanmade/?do=findComment&comment=936432","commentId":936432,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1387721605,"content":"Well I don't do any of that OCTGN crap. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Thats all I could find for mistakes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95543-sheet-of-orc-hunting-fanmade/?do=findComment&comment=936552","commentId":936552,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1387731731,"content":"Lol, octgn is good when you can't play with friends all together.
