And the extra point of attack the defender has over the guardian can be also quite nice. Plus it already combo well with the two Gondor synergies, For Gondor and Behind Strong Walls. Further great to a Háma deck…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69994-defender-of-rammas/?do=findComment&comment=683261","commentId":683261,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1346091170,"content":"And you don't have to pay a resource to keep it around after it defends.

Firstly, he's not very good at attacking, and what with most enemies having more than one defense, he's much better as a defender. Though he appears strictly better than Winged Gaurdian, I'm hoping there will be some more eagle love in later sets (perhaps second hobbit saga pack?)\n\n \n\nAlso, I'm thinking that the defender will be needed in theses new scenarios, as they will be combat heavy, I'm thinking (you know, being a siege and all)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69994-defender-of-rammas/?do=findComment&comment=683873","commentId":683873,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1346166753,"content":"Yeah, he's probably better for solo play, but the Winged Guardian's sentinel is really helpful in multiplayer games.
