For example: \"Mablung\" will only return the Third Age Tactics hero, \"Mablung +custom\" will also return the First Age elf of the same name. Alternatively, you can specifically pick \"First Age\" in the card set drop down menu.\n\nI encourage anyone who has not yet experienced this awesome adventure to go and check it out!\n\nhttp://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/first-age/ [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/first-age/]"}]}
