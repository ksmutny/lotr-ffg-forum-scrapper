Both do have Setup effects, too. So what happens (and what not)?\n\nDo I reduce my thread, attach the Ring and search for a Master card? If I decide to take a mulligan, will I keep the master card? Or woud the search for a Master card be after that?\n\n... didn't play for a while, I am confused about the rules.

Shuffle Decks\n2. Place heroes and set threat levels\n3. Create token bank\n4. Determine first player\n5. Draw starting hand (take mulligan)\n6. Place quest cards\n7. Preform scenario setup instructions\n\nAny setup instructions on hero cards would take place during step 2. And I'm also going to assume that's true for player cards that are not heroes, like The One Ring. So in this case you would lower your threat by 3 and attach The One Ring to Eowyn. Then search search your deck for a master card and add it to your hand. If you later decide to take a mulligan you get to keep the master card. Then you follow the setup in instructions on the quest 1A."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301588-the-long-arm-of-mordor-and-setup-effects-and-mulligan/?do=findComment&comment=3815760","commentId":3815760,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1572189233,"content":"Ah, right.

As far as I remember, this means cards like Faint do not work, but cards like weapon attachments (which e.g. boost attached characters values) do count. What about cards like Quick Strike or Hands Upon the Bow? They state: exhaust a character to declare an attack. Can that attack target the unique enemy?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301588-the-long-arm-of-mordor-and-setup-effects-and-mulligan/?do=findComment&comment=3815973","commentId":3815973,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1572214402,"content":"Quick Strike works.

Basically, cards that allow you to perform a true framework attack, but temporally displaced from its regular time, will work—Quick Strike, Oath of Eorl.
