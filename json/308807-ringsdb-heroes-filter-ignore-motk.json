You can filter out published decks by excluding Messenger of the King (even though the system does not force you to include that in a deck with a MotK hero), but not the Card Search. One useful thing is that if you sort your search by name all the (MotK) cards will be at the start of the list so you can scroll past them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308807-ringsdb-heroes-filter-ignore-motk/?do=findComment&comment=3946631","commentId":3946631,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1590841387,"content":"You can dissallow MotK heroes within the setup of which packs you own.
