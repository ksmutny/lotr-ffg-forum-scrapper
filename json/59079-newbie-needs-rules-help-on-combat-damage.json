In a given round your characters can only do 1 of the following - Commit to the quest, Defend an attack, or attack an enemy.\n\nThe difference between a defended attack and an undefended attack is basically choosing whether or not you are going to declare a defender against a single enemie's attack  by exhausting a character you control (whether it be an ally or Hero) to subtract it's defense strength against the enemies attack.\n\nIf you choose to defend with a character you must exhaust him then the shadow card is flipped (apply any effects) then subtract the total enemy attack strength against your characters total defense strength. The difference is how much damage you put on that character.\n\nIf you choose not to defend an attack (whether is your choice or not) after flipping the shadow card (apply any effects) you must put all the damage done by the enemy on one of your heroes. (Which sucks) . You can choose any hero you want whether they quested, already exhausted or still readied but it has to be a hero.\n\nDeciding what your heros/allys do each round is a big part of this game. Sometime you can't afford to quest because of the number of enemies in play is to great. Or sometimes the threat is so great that you can't spare characters to defend or attack enemies you are engaged with.\n\n \n\nHere is an example of the combat phase. I will use the core Tactic deck for this....Assume this is a solo player game\n\nAt the beginning of the Combat phase:\n\nThalin is exhausted because he commited to the quest.\nGimili and Legolas are both Readied\n\nA Forest Spider engages you during the engagement checks and now at the point where the Spider is going to attack.\n\nYou must decided right then if you are going to exhaust (tap) either Gimili or Legolas to defend the Spider's attack.\n\n(Example of Defending )\n\nYou decided to declare Gimili as a Defender (by exhausting him) against the Spider's attack. \n\n Then you reveal the shadow card (for this example nothing happens)\n\nI believe the forest spider gets +1 Attack strength when it engages a player so it now has an attack strength of 3\nThen you compare that total to Gimili's defense strength of 2. \n3-2 = 1 so you place 1 point of damage on Gimli\n\n \n\n(Example of not Defending)\n\nThis time you decide that you rather leave both of your heros readied to be able to attack the spider.\n\nYou declare that the attack will not be defended and you reveal the shadow effect. \nThe shadow effect of the card says the attacking enemy gets +1 attack strength (or +3 if this attack is undefended)\n\nThis mean that the spider is now dealing 6 damage (because it got +1 from it's card text and +3 from the shadow effect)\n\nThis means that you must place 6 damage on one of your heroes. (which that would kill any of them that you choose).  Even if you had an ally in play it cannot be assigned the undefended damage.\n\n \n\nIn short, always think long and hard before leaving an attack undefended.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59079-newbie-needs-rules-help-on-combat-damage/?do=findComment&comment=580493","commentId":580493,"userName":"~Rampage~","timestamp":1326756459,"content":"I really appreciate you taking the time to explain all of that, it helps a lot!  Thank you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59079-newbie-needs-rules-help-on-combat-damage/?do=findComment&comment=580599","commentId":580599,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1326784381,"content":"I also personally recommend searching the LOTR:LCG [http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77423/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game] site on Board Game Geek for files that will be helpful.\n\nThe one I use the most:\n\nFAQ 5.1 [http://files.boardgamegeek.com/file/download/83bdtagp5q/LoTR_LCG_Cards_and_FAQs_v5.1.pdf?] - Lists all the cards for LOTR:LCG and answers any FAQ's that have been asked about that card.

Not to say a lot in the bbg faq isn't good infomation, but many of them are just opinions that are not \"true\". The entire reason that people ask some questons is that the rules are not clear. There have already been some mega retractions in that faqs history were they got somthing tottaly wrong. It is a good start for a nw player, but just remeber that NOTHING in there is set in stone... the only place that matters is card text, official rule book and official faq."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59079-newbie-needs-rules-help-on-combat-damage/?do=findComment&comment=580613","commentId":580613,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1326787136,"content":"Feel free to post those links."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59079-newbie-needs-rules-help-on-combat-damage/?do=findComment&comment=580616","commentId":580616,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326787371,"content":"they are in the official support page at ffg lotr sub site. just click catalog about go to lotr and then click support and download the pdfs"}]}
