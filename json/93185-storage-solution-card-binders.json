I decided to re-arrange my arrange my player cards in binders (the encounter & quest cards I keep in boxes).\n\n \n\nBut now I was a bit stuck on how to order the cards. Obviously I want the best solution to easily access cards for deckbuilding, because I build a lot and often change decks. Obviously I will separate the cards by sphere. And then I will probably separate them by Expansion, i.e. I will probably keep Core Set + Mirkwood APs on separate sheets from the Khazad-Dum + APs cards.\n\n \n\nBut would you suggest to order the cards by number or by card type? That is have all the player cards from the core-set and APs in order of their number or have first e.g. all allies, then all events, then all attachments,etc\n\n \n\nI know this may sound like a minor problem to most of you I guess, but I couldn't really figure out the best way to sort cards. I think going Sphere -> Expansion Block -> Card Type -> Card Number is probably the best way?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93185-storage-solution-card-binders/?do=findComment&comment=904182","commentId":904182,"userName":"Lukez","timestamp":1383839319,"content":"I feel like Sphere -> Card Type -> Expansion Block ->Card Number might be a little easier "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93185-storage-solution-card-binders/?do=findComment&comment=904210","commentId":904210,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1383841709,"content":"For deck-building purposes I organize my player cards (in card boxes) as follows:\n\nBy Sphere (each sphere gets its own box)\nBy Type: Heroes, Allies, Attachments, Events\n\nBy Cost\nAlphabetically\n\n \n\nThis might seem a bit unorthodox, but it definitely helps aid deck-building. Not only can I quickly find a specific card that I am looking for, but it makes it easier to browse for general cards (e.g. \"I feel like this deck could use more attachments, let me browse through medium-costed Lore attachments and see if there are any good fits\"). Ultimately, organization is a very personal decision, which is why you will find that every player does it differently. Organizing it by expansion doesn't work for me, because the card pool has grown enough to where I can't always remember which expansion a card is from."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93185-storage-solution-card-binders/?do=findComment&comment=904268","commentId":904268,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1383845977,"content":"I organize my cards in boxes. I tried the binder when i got started, but then i decided to keep all my player cards sleeved, now the binders only hold the cards that really don't have a chance of seeing the light of day, although i always keep at least one of those sleeved and in the box just to remind me that it exists, and maybe one day it will be the card in a ground breaking strategy.\n\nThe way i organize my cards in the box is by Race/trait. That means all the Noldor cards are together, Rohan, Gondor, istari etc. if a card can be used by two traits I'll keep 2 with the trait i'll most likely use the card with and one copy with the other trait. The cards that are not assigned to any trait, like many attachments and events, are grouped by sphere. So, for example a card like Rivendell Blade, will have one copy in Noldor, and 2 copy in Silvain.\n\nThe only trait that has been refined further is the dwarf trait which i also separated by sphere since there are so may dwarf cards.\n\nI plan on refining the other traits when their card pool grows. Gondor is almost there, and i am sure Rohan will be there after the next cycle.\n\nIt's not perfect, but it works for me, since it makes it easier to see synergies within a trait when thumbing through the cards, since many are not dependent on sphere alone, and it helps me work towards creating thematic decks.\n\nAll my hero cards are kept together sleeved and ready to go. I try to keep them organized by sphere.\n\nI usually keep about 3 or more decks ready to go, and sometimes i forget certain cards are in those decks when i start to build a new deck.

It is really interesting to hear how everybody gets himself organised, though indeed there is probably also the issue of personal preference :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nI do like Beorn's suggestion to also sort the card by cost...guess that makes a lot of sense deck-building wise. But, lol, I think I see now why most people use boxes, most of the methods mentioned require a lot of re-organisation for the binders whenever new cards come out ;-)\n\n \n\nI also like Tracker1's suggestion with the traits..especially considering there will be evermore player cards. Sorting them by expansion now suddenly doesn't make so much sense anymore^^ I have to give this a bit more thought probably and try out different methods! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"}]}
