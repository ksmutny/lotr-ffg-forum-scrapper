I am about to start playing for the first time and will be playing solo mostly. Is there any cards, like the wandering Took, that you guys have a \"ruling on\" for solo play?\n\nmany thanks\n\nregards mic"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47937-starting-solo/?do=findComment&comment=480788","commentId":480788,"userName":"Hahma","timestamp":1307311983,"content":"I haven't done anything different for him when playing solo. He will quest or take a bullet so to speak if need be, depending on the situation. Even co-op I imagine he can be situational in lowering your threat but increasing another player's threat."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47937-starting-solo/?do=findComment&comment=480803","commentId":480803,"userName":"BD Flory","timestamp":1307315019,"content":"If you mean are they modified in any way for solo?

(3)  Being the most powerful card, the more times you can use him, the better.  Cards that bring back Allies, or bring them in more cheaply, become a premium.  You will have lots of fun working out good combos and will get better as you learn the potential dangers.  Enjoy!  Cheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47937-starting-solo/?do=findComment&comment=480907","commentId":480907,"userName":"guest314224","timestamp":1307334285,"content":"Thanks for your help guys"}]}
