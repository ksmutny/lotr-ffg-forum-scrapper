If no Orc enemies are engaged with players, Conflict at the Crossroads gains surge.\n\n \n\nDark Pursuit\n \n\n>  \n> \n> When Revealed: Raise the total Threat of the staging area by 1 for each Scout enemy in play. If there are no Scout enemies in play, Dark Pursuit gains surge.\n\n \n\nScourge of Mordor\n\n \n\n> When Revealed: Each player discards the top card of his deck. Until the end of the phase, raise the total [Threat] in the staging area by X, where X is the total cost of all cards discarded by this effect.\n\n \n\nUnder the Shadow\n\n \n\n> When Revealed: Until the end of the phase, raise the total Threat Strength in the staging area by X, where X is the number of players in the game.\n\n \n\nIf you are supposed to add the archery total and the threat total as you all say, then how do you resolve the second half of the following card (Ill Purpose)?\n\n \n\nIll Purpose\n\n \n\n> All enemies in the staging area engage the player with the highest threat. Then, each player raises his threat by the total [Threat] of all cards in the staging area.\n\n \n\n1.  Raise each players threat by the total threat of the cards in the staging area including any modifications to said cards.\n\n2.  Raise each players threat by the total threat in the staging area, regardless of whether or not there are 0 cards in it.\n\n \n\nEdit: I think the staging area is supposed to have its own threat strength, but the rules don't state that and that would make threat being added to the staging area simple to resolve without any sort of confusion.  Black Feathered Arrows and Archery X is still confusing to me though.\n\nEdited August 27, 2015 by cmabr002"}]}
