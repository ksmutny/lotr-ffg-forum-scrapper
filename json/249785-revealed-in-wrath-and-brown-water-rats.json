That dash looks to me like an \"undefined\" value rather than a zero. When you damage an enemy you check if the amount of damage is greater than or equal to its number of hitpoints. I don't recall seeing rules for undefined comparisons in lotr, but they have them in CoC and comparison checks vs them always fail - that is you can never be more than an undefined value (or less or equal). Seen the death check can't succeed I would have the blanked Rats happily sit there with damage on them.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249785-revealed-in-wrath-and-brown-water-rats/?do=findComment&comment=2787533","commentId":2787533,"userName":"Mr_Underhill","timestamp":1494862814,"content":"I guess that makes sense, thanks.
