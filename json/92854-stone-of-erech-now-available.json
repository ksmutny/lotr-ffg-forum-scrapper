When you will just have to remember that you switched from eventide to dusk since encounter cards will start to be buffed while it is in play.\n\nIn terms of difficulty it's a pretty easy nut to crack, and was winning consistently with a few different decks on my 2nd day of owning it, but it is still a fun quest, and one that will see the table often.\n\nI think Glaurung's Thorin & Company will crush it, since willpower and attack stats are the key to victory in this scenario. This usually is not a problem if Dain is in play, but I am curious to hear how it goes with this deck. I would resist the urge to play them right away, and give something else a shot first."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92854-stone-of-erech-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=912702","commentId":912702,"userName":"Karlson","timestamp":1384913485,"content":"My copy is on its way.  I'll have the Morgul Vale and Stone of Erech both arriving right before the weekend hits; I'm excited!  (Because unfortunately this looks like the last of the new LotR LCG content for.. the.. rest.. of.. the.. year...)  \n\nEdited November 20, 2013 by Karlson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92854-stone-of-erech-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=913060","commentId":913060,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1384963496,"content":"Stone of Erech is really awesome.
