Won the first mission with leadership on my first try, and lost a few with lore, spirit and tactics. The next day I started building a leadership/spirit deck and won and lost some more. So time for the second quest. Beat the quest again on my first try, beginner's luck?\n\nFelt so confident I immediately played the quest again, and got brutally defeated and ended without even a single progression on the first part of the quest. But I loved it.. I don't think I have ever loved losing before.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nWednesday evening I played co-op with some friends I regularly play games with. One of them loved it as well and the other had some difficulty understanding the complete game at once, but I can't blame her for that. \n\n \n\nSo on Thursday I decided it was time for more cards, since I discovered there are quite a few expansions. And I really liked the idea of creating a better deck to play with, so I bought the following;\n\nAdventure - A Journey to Rhosgobel\n\nAdventure - The Dead Marshes\n\nDeluxe- Khazad-Dum \n\nAdventure - The Redhorn Gate\n\nAdventure - Road to Rivendell\n\nAdventure - The Watcher in the Water\n\nAdventure - The Long Dark\n\nAdventure - Shadow and Flame\n\nDeluxe - Heirs of Numenor\n\nAdventure - The Blood of Gondor\n\nAdventure - The Dunland Trap\n\nAdventure - The Antlered Crown\n\nSaga - The Black Riders\n\n \n\nAfter doing some reading on this forum, I discovered there is a natural order in which these were released and are preferred to be played. So I ordered the remaining expansions from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle;\n\nAdventure - The Hunt for Gollum\n\nAdventure - Conflict at the Carrock\n\nAdventure - The Hills of Emyn Muil\n\nAdventure - Return to Mirkwood\n\n \n\nSo my collection has grown pretty fast since only discovering this game last Monday, but I'm not rushing through it by playing everything at once. Like to take my time for exploring different card combinations and understanding the different cards by slowly adding them to what I have available.\n\nEven though I love constructing a great deck, I decided to limit myself to the players cards available per cycle.\n\n \n\nSo I opened the two Adventure packs from the first cycle and thought of ways to include them in my deck. But now I can't decide, do I start playing the first adventure expansion I have available, A Journey to Rhosgobel, or do I wait until The Hunt for Gollum is being delivered in a couple of days and continue playing Passage through Mirkwood and Journey down the Anduin? According to what I have read I am better of leaving Escape from Dol Guldur alone for a while?\n\n \n\nThanks for taking your time reading this and hopefully someone can tell me what I should do.  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175867-new-player-looking-for-advice/?do=findComment&comment=1615769","commentId":1615769,"userName":"Virani","timestamp":1431372074,"content":"Since it took a while before my first post got approved, I already decided to be patient and just wait for the other expansion packs to arrive at the end of the week.\n\nHowever, after reading these forums and while playing I found out about the core set and the 1x and 2x cards. \n\nI have read different opinions about buying multiple core sets, but my real question is; in all the different decks you use, how many times do you use extra copies of the cards from the core set? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175867-new-player-looking-for-advice/?do=findComment&comment=1615793","commentId":1615793,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1431373018,"content":"Welcome to the game!  That's awesome how you are just diving head first into the game.  I do suggest playing through the quests in the order they were released and limiting your available card pool as you go.  I also suggest ignoring escape from Dol Guldur until you get into the Dwarrowdelf cycle.\n\n \n\nRegarding multiple core sets, there are a few powerful 1x and 2x cards that you'll usually include in every deck that matches the sphere.  Steward of Gondor, Unexpected Courage, Sneak Attack (with Gandalf), Test of Will, and Feint are the main ones.  There are a few others that get used a lot like Northern Tracker, Horn of Gondor, and Celebrian's Stone.  If you are just making one deck, buying a 2nd core set won't make a huge difference.  You might have 1 extra copy of 3 or 4 cards as a result of the 2nd core.  But if you are planning to make 2 or more decks, having a second core can be handy to let you put 3 Gandalfs in multiple decks, or Test of Will/Feint in multiple decks, or whatever.\n\n \n\nBut unlike other LCGs, this is a co-op.  So it doesn't really matter if your deck is slightly weaker than it could possibly be.  If you are planning to mostly play solo, stick with one core set for now.  If you are planning to occasionally play 3 or 4 player, definitely get a second core."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175867-new-player-looking-for-advice/?do=findComment&comment=1615805","commentId":1615805,"userName":"Virani","timestamp":1431373652,"content":"Thanks!

However, I don't see them constructing a deck before playing some games.

Glad you enjoy it.\n\n \n\nYou are definitely in deep already. Have you got a grasp of the expansion/cycle format? Saga expansions like the Black Riders are independent, but deluxe expansions go with 6 adventure packs that should be played in order (first the quests in the big box, then pack 1-6). You can't play The Dunland Trap or The Antlered Crown without The Voice of Isengard, as you will need encounter cards from the expansion box.\n\n \n\nTake your time to explore the packs one at a time. You've made quite an investment if you've bought all that for normal prices, so if I were you I would break open maybe one pack a week and try the new cards and scenarios (depending on how long you want that experiencec to last).\n\n \n\nWe like to link Beorn's Path [https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/] to new players, too. Hall of Beorn is a great resource overall and has blog articles and a card search function.\n\nEdited May 11, 2015 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175867-new-player-looking-for-advice/?do=findComment&comment=1615873","commentId":1615873,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1431376611,"content":"I have been playing since day one and I can tell you that the reason I think you will last is because you said you loved losing. In my experience that is what you need to be able to play this game successfully and long term. This game is brutally difficult at times, but that is when it is the most fun. If you find yourself getting crushed by a quest, don't worry. It happens to everyone. A lot of people got crushed by Into Ithelien, but I beat it pretty easily, but then Morgan Vale kicked my butt. It took me dozens of decks before I finally felt I had mastered the quest. Don't even get me started on Nightmare Versions, some of which are insane.\n\nI also recommend the website A Tale from the Cards, especially the buyer's guide, so you know what expansions to buy. Have fun!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175867-new-player-looking-for-advice/?do=findComment&comment=1615906","commentId":1615906,"userName":"Virani","timestamp":1431378208,"content":"Thanks for the recommendations!\n\nI have visited both sites already and started reading some of their 101's, but I also like to learn about the cards by playing them, so I won't read in to the articles too much for now. Although I am glad I found out that tactics from core isn't really viable, because I just lost two games in a row with spirit/tactics. \n\n \n\nAbout the cycles and saga's, yes I think I completely understand. So I will slowly expand by opening packs when I feel like I experienced the cards from the previous cycle/expansion. It's a bit hard to resist opening everything at once, but I feel like I will get to know the cards and game better by taking it slow. \n\n \n\nAnd I know it will probably take a while before I reach the Dunland Trap or Antlered Crown, but they were pretty cheap compared to were I got the core set and they didn't have much stock, so I bought everything they had. The Adventure packs were €11 compared to €19 and the Deluxe packs were €24 compared to €37 or something. And since I really liked the game I took everything they had, since new stock will probably be a lot more expensive with the Euro/Dollar rate. \n\n \n\nAnd I would have never imagined to like losing, but after every defeat I simply start to analyze how to enhance my deck. So hopefully newer cards will live up to my expectations and planned strategies.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175867-new-player-looking-for-advice/?do=findComment&comment=1615967","commentId":1615967,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1431380517,"content":"Awesome thread.\n\nSounds very much like me.
