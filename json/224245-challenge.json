Sometimes you just get lucky and don't have to deal with the worst that the encounter deck has to offer; other times, you take all the treacheries to the face. I actually especially relish winning scenarios when I haven't cancelled a single thing. (Also, I only ever slot in condition removal when I feel like I NEED to.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224245-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=2296037","commentId":2296037,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1467730218,"content":"I actually don't usually use the cancellation cards nowadays. In the early days of the game there were a few really nasty cancel-or-die treacheries, but other than that we have a wide enough cardpool now that I consider cancellation just one of many options for dealing with the encounter deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224245-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=2296102","commentId":2296102,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1467731876,"content":"Pretty common thing to do, actually.
