So imagine I quest with my characters succesfully, being able to get to the second stage of this adventure \"The Rear Guard\". So what happens? I imagine the progress tokens on the previous quest card are removed and you switch to this stage of the quest now, before the end of the quest phase, right? That will cause to basically start this quest phase with 4 tokens on the card, correct?\n\nForced: If at least 1 Hero committed to the Quest this round, place 4 progress tokens on The Rear Guard (bypassing any active Location) at the end of the Quest phase. If Durin's Bane has 0 hit points, advance to the next stage of the scenario immediately.\n\nThanks!\n\nJavier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73845-shadows-and-flame-the-rear-guard/?do=findComment&comment=719465","commentId":719465,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1352187897,"content":"Maggical said:\n\nHi there all,\n\nI have a question about this quest card.
