He's pretty solid altogether, a nice emergency outlet for when things go bad. Probably should have 4hp though.  Unless you are losing heroes a lot, he's generally worse than Ranger of Cardolan.\n\n \n\nSpirit Beregond is great.  I would say he's better than the Tactics version.  Hopefully they start printing some more Gondor allies in Spirit, the current crop is rather mediocre.\n\nEdited July 19, 2016 by williamobrien"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2317763","commentId":2317763,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1468964731,"content":"You can only do one Desperate Alliance per phase (There was a ruling a while back that any event which says Limit 1 per phase should really be like The Tree People since as written it's meaningless).\n\n \n\nAnd what I'm getting from your other comments is that I guess neither of you has played or observed a good Caldara deck.

The payoff for having played (or put into play with Caldara) Imrahil and another unique ally is that those allies are in play. They're already worth the resources you paid for them (or the resources you paid for Fortune or Fate). Sword-thain not so much, but it is generating resources for you and making Map of Earnil free. So at most you've paid the 4 resources for Sword-thain to get this set up, and it refunds those over time. Getting allies into your discard pile is also not that difficult with effects like Eowyn/Arwen/Mirror of Galadriel (not all three in the same deck obviously), and the real workhorse of the Caldara deck, Zigil Miner.\n\nAlly Imrahil already removes the downside of discarding Caldara that you lose out on her resources, making it harder to pay for Fortune or Fate so you can do it again.

Bearing in mind that I've had games where I discarded and revived Caldara once every two rounds or so on average (and again this was pre-Arwen), that's quite a few additional allies.

Éomer, who was unscathed together with Aragorn and Imrahil and who hasn't yet appeared in the saga, is quite likely.

There are several possibilities for the fourth ally: Merry (with Pippin in the last box), Lore Denethor ally, one of the twins (seems unlikely, but could work if the other twin appeared in the last saga box), or any of the other commanders in the battle of Pellenor Fields (Rohan or Gondor/Outlands -- but not with the Outlands trait).\n \nI hope the Fellowship attachment is Elendil's standard, sewed by Arwen.\nEdited July 19, 2016 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2317825","commentId":2317825,"userName":"Supertoe","timestamp":1468967544,"content":"Ummm.

Not only do we finally have an epic defender in spirit but he can reduce threat pretty reliably/regularly. His ability is definitely as spirit as can be so even though his stats might not really fit spirit and he sort of bleeds into other spheres his ability sort of makes up for this and ensures he does stay true to his sphere whilst also doing something very new and unique for spirit. \n\nAlly version of Imrahil is just fantastic.... 4 cost for 2/2/2/3 is already a decent enough deal and he has the Gondor trait so can easily be pumped up to better stats (3/3/2/3 is most likely with Leadermir and Visionary Leadership). His ability is sort of just the cherry on top. In any game where you DO lose a hero he steps in and completely eliminates any resource loss you would incur and can then also receive hero only attachments and buffs and whatnot. In any game where you do not lose a hero he is still a great ally with very nice stats that will most likely only have boosted stats in any Gondor deck. He is also great with Caldara as any time she is in your discard pile he is generating resources and can receive hero only buffs/attachments, then when you bring her back he goes back to being an ally but can keep any of those attachments he received and if you then discard her additional times he will step up to hero status each time you do taking away most of the drawback of having to sacrifice her (resource generation, one less spirit hero, loss of stats).\n\n \n\nThen we have these four new AMAZING cards for defense. My favourite is easily Sterner than Steel. FINALLY some shadow control/cancellation that is actually useful.... first Armoured Destrier which is an epic card and now Sterner than Steel. Both are on a similar level to Hasty Stroke and Burning Brand in my opinion. \n\nTo me personally this makes up for cards like Staff of Lebethron, Silver Lamp, Shadows Give Way etc which to me are either extremely subpar shadow control cards or are extremely niche and only useful in very specific deck builds. \n\nSterner than Steel is essentially just Hasty Stroke in tactics with a cost of 0 instead of 1 but you need an armour or weapon attachment on the defending character. Now so long as you are running a deck where your defender receives multiple armour or weapon attachments and you are running tactics this card is VASTLY superior to hasty stroke in my opinion. \n\nFirst off Hasty Stroke is in spirit and many combat decks do not run spirit so you may need to rely on another deck to play this card for you when it is needed. Secondly saving a spare resource can be tricky.... especially if you have both Test of Will AND hasty stroke in hand..... do you cancel that awful treachery and hope you don't see a game ending shadow card? Or do you just take the treachery and save hasty stroke just in case (and then face the potential of not having to use it at all...)?\nWith Sterner than Steel you don't need to save a resource as it costs zero you JUST need the tactics resource match on a hero.\n\nThe very nature of shadow cards is that they are a nasty surprise as well as highly unpredictable so having a cancel that does not require resources is honestly the most ideal situation in my opinion as this means no matter what the game state so long as there is a weapon or armour attachment on the defending character you can ALWAYS cancel a shadow with this card. The amount of times I have had Hasty Stroke in hand but cannot play it at a pivotal moment is beyond count. I can tell you that in the VAST VAST majority of these situations my defender had Gondorian Shield or Elven Mail or in many situations BOTH attached to him. \n\nThirdly and lastly exhausting a card like Gondorian Shield, Elven Mail or any of the other various weapons or armour that do not require exhausting for their effects is not only completely inconsequential but it is also going to happen very reliably considering that character is a dedicated defender and is SUPPOSED to receive those attachments anyway and as quickly as possible. Armour and Weapons that require exhausting for their own effects obviously are nowhere near as good paired with Sterner than Steel but I run very few of these type of cards so for me and many others this will not be a concern. \nThis card is going straight into my decks and hasty stroke is coming straight out of them. \n\nThe other three are great as well. One spirit resource for +2 defence AND readying that character, yes please! The Golden Shield is not quite as great as it is unique, restricted and requires exhausting however it does not say printed willpower so someone like spirit Theoden with 2 mounts attached and Elfhelm hero in play would get a +4 defence boost from the shield which is actually pretty **** powerful. Eowyn similarly can get +4 WITHOUT any boosts as her starting willpower is 4. Tactics Theoden would get +3 and is also a great recipient. I definitely think the weakest is Livery of the Tower but honestly even it seems like it would shine in certain decks. It can replace healing altogether in certain situations (Livery + Raven Winged Helm could completely negate any need for healing in a spirit/tactics deck) and does cost zero so I can see it being extremely good in certain situations. The restricted slot it takes up is somewhat worrying however as it does not add any stats or other abilities and if you have no resources to prevent damage with in the first place it does absolutely nothing at all. \n\nSO MANY new options and cards for defensive play and attachment heavy decks. The cards we get in Saga packs sometimes are just so goddamn useful/powerful/epic.\n\nEdited July 20, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2318194","commentId":2318194,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1468991745,"content":"As a true Spirit lover, my current state is:\n\n \n\n0Q6wAtu0.png [https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/617154725046259713/0Q6wAtu0.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2318199","commentId":2318199,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1468992020,"content":"The cards are fantastic!!

I'm not sure I would put it in my deck though.\n\nThere's an action window between \"resolve shadow effect\" and \"determine combat damage\", so in the case of a boosted attack, using Blood could be more efficient or less efficient, depending on how many resources you have available and how much you want to stop.  Obviously Blood is worthless with one resource, and Livery is better with two resources -- it can stop two damage, while Blood cannot.  With three or more resources Blood has the potential to be cheaper, though with any number of resources, Livery is capable of stopping N damage while Blood is maxed out at N-1.\n\n \n\nHowever, there are other shadows that Livery protects against and Blood does not.  Cards that reduce or eliminate defense may not be salvageable with Blood, and cards that do direct damage are not affected by Blood, but can be prevented with Livery.  On a high-defense defender, those are precisely the sort of shadows I worry about.\n\n \n\nLivery can also reduce damage from undefended attacks.  As a use-every-turn measure, Blood's (potentially) lower cost and ability to buff defense for the entire phase is definitely superior.  As an emergency save-my-hero protection, Livery is more flexible and powerful.  However, it does have the disadvantage of taking a restricted slot, which Blood does not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2319122","commentId":2319122,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1469040551,"content":"Interesting!

The nice bonus of it now is that it is armour. Restricted can be a problem, so of course you have to pick your targets wisely. Right now, Gondorian Shield and Livery of the Tower seem two best restricted attachments for Tactics Boromir. I always see him rather as a defender than a attacker -- though he often does a lot of attacking too. Blood and Fire are hard to apply without Leadership, but Livery is good even without a couple of resources."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2320449","commentId":2320449,"userName":"Estel Edain","timestamp":1469118718,"content":">  \n> \n> So the player cards for Flame of the West (with a bit of speculation) are:\n> \n> Aragorn (Fellowship, 1)\n> Éowyn (Tactics, 2)\n> Beregond (Spirit, 3)\n>  \n> ?

The Grey Company brought Roheryn with them, knowing that Aragorn needed haste. There's a good chance that Roheryn's neutral, to fit with any version of Aragorn, but Leadership would also work.\n\nSince Aragorn's ability relates to artifacts, I expect that we'll get an artifact attachment. If Roheryn's in the box, the artifact would very likely be Fellowship sphere. The standard Arwen made for Aragorn seems the likeliest option."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2321906","commentId":2321906,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1469193150,"content":"Or a Grey Company attachment like FotR!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225345-gather-strength/?do=findComment&comment=2322463","commentId":2322463,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1469214106,"content":"The Standard seems given.
