When I play solo, I'm almost forced to include Leadershit if I want a fighting chance. \n\n \n\nWhat I meant about Leadershit Rohan support here is that - if they decide to give something speicific Rohan related in the last pack, the two leadershit player cards (aside from hero) would have to do something about it, and if they do - I hope they won't be tied to that hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125623-who-will-be-the-hero-in-antlered-crown/?do=findComment&comment=1312363","commentId":1312363,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1414358250,"content":"I play solo and almost never use Leadership heroes, but I do put some purple cards in my decks sometimes with Songs.\n\nEdited October 26, 2014 by Bullroarer Took"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125623-who-will-be-the-hero-in-antlered-crown/?do=findComment&comment=1312417","commentId":1312417,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1414362426,"content":"Man, I'll never understand how people can restrict themselves to only playing certain spheres, traits, or whatever.

The question is if the hero will conform to existing themes of Rohan (High willpower, discard for benefits, attack into the staging area, etc.) or if they'll try to shore up some of Rohan's weaknesses (defense, resources, card draw...).
