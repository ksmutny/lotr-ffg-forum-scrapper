This is known in the game as \nstaging. These encounter cards are revealed one at a \ntime, with any “when revealed” effects being resolved \nbefore the next card is revealed. Enemy and location \ncards revealed in this manner are placed in the staging \narea, treachery cards are resolved and (unless otherwise \nindicated by the card text) placed in the discard pile.\n \n\nFrom this I gather Treachery cards do not enter the staging area, they just resolve."}]}
