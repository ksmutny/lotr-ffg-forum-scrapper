As for the appearance of the Easterlings, it's normally assumed that they should look \"asian\" or \"middle-eastern\" like they showed them in the movies, but that is really just an interpretation not necessarily contained in the text. In fact it has been suggested that, for example, the Variags (a supposedly alien southeastern group), were inspired by the varangian mercenaries in Byzantium, that is, \"easternized\" norse. For all we know, to Tolkien all of Middle earth except Harad and the far south could have been germanic aesthetically. Seems like they went for a Rus/Slavic barbarian look for the Easterlings, which is very appropiate IMO. As I've said recently, this game keeps getting better and better, I can't wait for this new cycle.\n\nEdited June 28, 2019 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296845-the-temple-of-doom/?do=findComment&comment=3730288","commentId":3730288,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1561725310,"content":"This is not how slavic barbarians looked like thou.
