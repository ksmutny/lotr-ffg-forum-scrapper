Just following instructions on the quest card, or, let's say, to play 3p Journey down the Anduin, I need to have in the encounter deck 2 copies of each of the small decks listed on the quest card?\n\n \n\nI guess there's no need to build a bigger encounter deck, but still, it seems like you go through the encounters rather quickly otherwise\n\n \n\nThanks for help"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124690-playing-3p-and-4p/?do=findComment&comment=1297197","commentId":1297197,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1413132937,"content":"You don't modify the encounter deck based on number of players.  It's true that you will cycle through the deck faster with more players, but this just means the you end up seeing those same nasty treacheries more often.  That's a trend for more recent quests, as well: small encounter deck size.  The deck recycles more often, and it results in more consistent gameplay for the scenario."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124690-playing-3p-and-4p/?do=findComment&comment=1297207","commentId":1297207,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1413134784,"content":"Good to know, thanks!
