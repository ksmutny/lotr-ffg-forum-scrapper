I'm curious about how it turned out considering the old start with a low threat and slowly pick off the troll and other enemies tactic would probably add some serious points for rounds.\n\nI tried several times tonight with various decks but couldn't manage a single win. Got to stage two a couple times at about Round 14+. At one point I went through two entire games back-to-back without drawing a single ally in decks that were half allies or more. Terrible luck (or terrible shuffling). I'll get back to it tomorrow.\n\nAnd don't come in here talking about how easy the scenario is. Tired of hearing it. It is composed of some of the worst encounter cards available so far. Anyone who beats it 100% of the time solo with one core set needs to post video evidence with deck lists and well formatted game logs. I'm not buying the open claims of success anymore. Proof or get out. I could sit here all day claiming I'm a surgeon and I just bought my third vacation home. Words don't mean diddly.\n\nSolo Anduin. Let's go.

Other than that, I don't see 100% happening, ever.\n\nOnce the troll is ensnared, it's pretty much close to certain victory. The problem is, every time he swings at an hero he can potentially outright lose you the game (shadow: ignore armor or +1 damage).\n \n\nI'm doing this with Lore / Leadership (Bilbo, guy who puts 1$  on a questing hero, guy who gets 1$ per damage on him). The starting thread is low so I've got some time to get an forrest trap. Also I'm drawing a ton cards which helps getting it faster. Like I said, when you manage to ensnare him the rest is a cakewalk. Before that though you can pretty much lose quite fast and unexpected by some unlucky shadow cards.

At all. And what do you mean with \"only fvie threat reducers\"? In more than 75 percent of your games you should have one of them in your starting hand!\n\n \n\nSo, what can I say to help you? Well, I might not be a genius, but I think it's safe to assume that Protector of Lorien in combination with Beravor or Bilbo should be essential to get a good score in this scenario. And use Gandalf (if he's in your deck, that is) to hit the troll, thread reduction is not as essential as it had been (I wonder if it would be even ok to play this scenario without Greeting of the Galadrim)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=555503","commentId":555503,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1321206781,"content":"I own all released adventure packs and 1 core set.

Results were 126, 187 and 115.\n\n \n\nIn the last game I had a few lucky draws from the encounter deck. I started against Gladden Fields and the Hill Troll, but I had Henemarth Riversong right from the beginning. I used his action every round, which helped a lot because the first two cards from the encounter deck were Pursued by Shadows. By round 3 my threat was at 29, but I could use Galadrim's Greeting to bring it down to 23. In the meanwhile I had played Eomund as an ally and Burning Brand on Bilbo.\n\nThe encounter deck then spilled out the Goblin Snipers who were immediatly killed by Dunhere.\n\nIn round 4 I got Treacherous Fog (yeah!) and made some more progress in the quest. Dunhere sang the Song of Wisdom.\n\nIn round 5 the Beastmaster of Dol Guldur approached who didn't care about my party but was attacked by Dunhere nonetheless (2 damage).\n\nDuring round 6 I had to cross another Treacherous Fog, and afterwards the Beast Master was killed by Dunhere. I was able to play Rivendell Mistress before and thus got Song of Kings. I put it on Frodo who immediatly named himself Steward of Gondor, got a Favour by the Lady and gave a Dunedain Mark to Dunhere.\n\nIn round 7 a band of Misty Hill Goblins attacked my party, but they were deflected by the mighty Bilbo and killed by Dunhere and Eomund.\n\nRound 8 saw the battle against the Hill Troll. Gandalf himself damaged the troll badly before the fight even started. He absorbed the troll's attack while my remaining party, now supported by a Northern Tracker, slaughtered the poor troll. Henemarth was killed and Eomund wounded by The Necromancer's Reach which proofed that questing is sometimes more dangerous than fighting trolls.\n\nRound 9 again delivered my a lucky draw from the encounter deck: Banks of the Anduin and Evil Storm. I played Longbeard Mapmaker. Gandalf and Faramir joined my party using a Sneak Attack. Farmir performed his awesome action and supported the questing crew which consisted of Frodo (4 WP), Northern Tracker (2), the Mapmaker (2), Eomund (3), the Mistress (3) and Gandalf (5).\n\nI immediatly travelled to stage 3B and was confronted with some Wargs and the Necromancer's Path. Dunhere and Bilbo didn't give a **** about the latter. They both decided not to defend against the Wargs so Frodo used his powers to absorb the three points damage. The Wargs tried to flee (no shadow effect), but Dunhere got them just when they felt they were safe.\n\n \n\nMy final threat level was at 32, plus 90 points minus 7 points for the Hill Troll and the Gladden Fields = 115 points.\n\n \n\nI really had a good time with the encounter deck in this game. Six (!) treachery cards, all of them doing me little to none harm, three locations of which only the Gladden Fields were a threat and only four enemies of which I could kill two before they could attack me. Getting 2x Sneak Attack to use the Faramir/Gandalf combo was the cherry on the cake, of course."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=555630","commentId":555630,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1321249301,"content":"Of course the encounter deck took revenge immediately. demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]\n\n \n\nStarting card: Enchanted Stream\n\n1st encounter: Wolf Rider + Brown Lands\n\nI have no allies, I have nothing to cancel the threat of Brown Lands, my threat rises to 30.

Of course it's easier to win if you have 3 copies of powerhouses like Steward of Gondor or Unexpected Courage.\n\n \n\n \n\nAs for the scenario, I have completed 15 games so far.

I think if I'd replace Frodo with Eowyn my results would get better, but then it's more challenging and thus more fun to use the little sad hobbit instead. Scorewise I'm not too bad, got a 122 and a 133, but then I loose more often than I win. Appears that my deck is very vulnerable at the beginning of the game, as it is not able to handle too many enemies.\n\n \n\nFor anyone who wants to try, here is my deck (using 1 coreset, HfG + CatC expansion):\n\n \n\nNote: the deck is designed to compete against all quests.

I could not breach the 100 score mark, but Im convinced that 100 is well within reach and I dont even considers something like a sub-90 impossible. Let me lay out what just happend.\n\n \n\nPlease excuse me for not providing you with a deck list at this point. I got german cards and looking each of them up is a chore. I will however provide a full deck list if you got any honest interest in it.\n\n \n\nFirst of all, Im playing Gloin, Theodred and Bilbo (26 starting thread), using 1 core set and all expansions up until the fourth of the first cycle. Fielding a very nimble setup Im very reliant on getting tons of money with Gloin (letting him take damage each turn and healing with self preservation) and Theodreds questing abilty. This money can always be dumped quite easily since we draw a lot of cards with Bilbo, draw 2 for 3$ and the tap-to draw elf. Im using all the new enchantments for +1 attack, +1 armor and +2 willpower to compensate  for weak starting heroes.\n\nThe first game was a very standard one, very similar to my first experience with the quest (149 score). Prepare for the troll (4 turns left), put him in a trap and proceed slowly from there. This game turned out slightly better with a score of 142.\n\nSecond game I pulled the 3 thread from location, 2 surge crows and than +1 thread for each hero not commited to a quest DURING SETUP, leaving me with tons of stuff to deal with before the first turn AND only 1 turn left until troll pull. I conceded this game after setup and called it a loss.\n\nThe third game however was very interesting. It started off very promising- setup only gave me the 10thread / 2 damage ork. This guy would basically give me 2 risk-free extra resources each turn (if he remains unblocked he can put at max 3 damage on Gloin which I can mitigate with SP). I also had Steward of Gondor on my starting hand and got Celebrians Stone on my first 2 cards. During the first 4 turns until I had to worry about the Troll, both decks were very kind.\n\nIn turn 5 the first major deviation on the way to a quick victory occurs. Instead of eating a hefty troll blow on a chump blocker for a ton of thread, trapping him and proceeding slowly from there, I manage to kill him right away AND clear step 1 in a single turn. This is basically how its done:\n\nThe main phase delivers Gandalf, who puts damage on the troll. Then I clear the quests 8 points (+location) by commiting everything but gandalf to questing. (Thanks to Faramir Ive got enough willpower to do that). Gandalf proceeds to block the Troll (I think I did a mistake there. I remember dealing me 2 thread after the trolls swing vs Gandalf, forgetting that Gandalf HPs would prevent the ogers trample-thread from occoring. Im not sure though so Id rather keep the 2 thread on my final score). Then I play ready everything for 5 (only 1 copy in deck!). Yes, the combo costs 10. Only doable with Gloin, Theodrid and Steward I assume. With everything beeing able to attack again and the 4 gandalf-direct-damage on the troll I can sweap the board (think I had a crow left or so) AND proceed to stage 2 in one turn at the end of turn 5.  At this point Im allready like \"Omg, I just might do cut 100!\"\n\nThe upcoming 6th turn made conviced me even more that I could do it. since Im basically able to clear it in 1 turn. With 2 copies of ready target ally on hand I can use Faramir 3 times, giving everyone a ricicoules +3 Spirit. At this point I have to kill 1 tiny creature AND turn over 2 treachery / locations in order to f innish with 60 from turn, 33-ish from thread, 4 from damage (1 in Bilbo...)  and -7 from VP. I might just end up at 90 if everything goes well! Jeezzz!\n\nBut instead everything goes to ****. I pull the surge-crow, the fat snake-thing with 7 life and the 1 damage on each exhausted ally treachery. The treachery almost wipes my ally board (Faramir survices) clean. Bilbo (with 2$ on him) goes to hell, not only giving me a crushing -9VP, but also leaving me behind with only 2 heroes, quick strike, Faramir (allready in play) and a bunch of now useless Lore-cards on hand.\n\nThe treachery + snake ruin my day so badly its not even funny. My heroes have no +attack from items, so I got 6 attack power total on the board. I need to kill a crow and the 7 life / 1 armor snake. I cannot take a single snake-blow unblocked, leaving me only at 4 effective attack power. Until I clear the board I got nothing to improve my hand, only drawing lore stuff. On turn 9 I finally remember that I can give the +1 def attachment on Faramir to a hero so that he actually dies from a snake-hit. Only this way I can Im able to get a second Faramir with Quick Strike out for a final missing damage point.\n\nSo with instead of 90 points on a good final draw I end up with a freaking 132.\n\nOn the one hand, I seemed to have very good draws from the encouter deck. On the other hand though I was using a deck that was far from beeing maxed out on potential due to severe card limitations. If I sum it up I come to the conclusion that (If people keep trying) the 100 is a very reasonable number for a good game. Also I can only encourage players to challenge the quest in such a \"competitive\" way, its really great fun.\n\nSorry again for not qouting card names every time. **** german cards. Let me know though if you want to recreate and test this deck, I will happily put the effort into it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=556292","commentId":556292,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1321368489,"content":"Thanks for the detailed write up, UK.

Dunhere is great for sniping but if I can consistently burn through that second stage I won't need much sniping.

The quest specifically says \"(if one is not already in play)\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=556994","commentId":556994,"userName":"Thorongil","timestamp":1321528694,"content":"I hadn't scored my quests for a while, even after the release of the new scoring system, but was inspired by this thread to go back to Journey Down the Anduin and see what I could do. I haven't broken 100 yet, but it's definitely feasible.\n\nI played four games recently and was surprised to lose the first after a set up that put 3 enemies into the staging area before anything started. With 5 enemies attacking on turn 2, Frodo could only deflect so much, and I hit 50 threat on turn 3. After that, I scored 115 in the second game and was on pace to win the third game, but not in less than 10 turns, putting my projected score well over 130 even after it was time for bed. I called that one a wash, but on the 4th game, I had some better draws and got a score of 101.\n\nHeroes: Aragorn, Beravor, and Frodo.\n\nTurn 7 win, 37 threat, 1 wound (Frodo), 7 victory points (Gladden Fields, Hill Troll).\n\nMy opening hand included Protector of Lorien, Sneak Attack, Snowbourn Scout, and Unexpected Courage. Setup yielded The Necromancer's Reach to no effect, and on the first turn, I drew into Steward of Gondor and Gandalf (since Beravor *always* draws, my draw is 3 a turn, or better). On the 2nd turn, Gandalf and Aragorn put 8 wounds on the Hill Troll after Aragorn defended with Protector of Lorien and Unexpected Courage, and Gandalf finished it off on turn 3. Recurring Snowbourn Scouts took the hits from other enemies along the way while Aragorn got Celebrian's Stone and Steward of Gondor to quest and attack each turn. By the end of the game, he had two Dunedain Marks.\n\nOn turn 7, I completed the 2nd stage, and revealed 2 locations, so I only had a single Wargs in the staging area. I drew the shadow card and talked to it for a second, telling it to have a shadow effect, and it yielded a +1 ATTK for a decisive kill on the Snowbourn Scout. Aragorn wiped out the Wargs, and that was it. So 101 was a lucky score, but I could easily have scored lower with the same encounter draws had I drawn a second copy of Gandalf to Sneak Attack in for some late-game threat reduction.\n\nDeck:\n\nAragorn, Beravor, Frodo\n\nGandalf x3\n\nRadagast\n\nFaramir\n\nSnowbourn Scout x3\n\nSneak Attack x3\n\nCelebrian's Stone x3\n\nSteward of Gondor x3\n\nDunedain Mark x3\n\nLore of Imladris x3\n\nGleowine x2\n\nMiner of the Iron Hills x3\n\nProtector of Lorien x3\n\nHaldir of Lorien\n\nGildor Inglorion\n\nHenamarth Riversong\n\nWill of the West x2\n\nNorthern Tracker x2\n\nUnexpected Courage x3\n\nStand and Fight x3\n\nA Test of Will x3\n\nHasty Stroke x3\n\nFor what it's worth, the deck has beaten all of the Core Set and Shadows of Mirkwood scenarios released, except for Escape from Dol Guldur. Some of the cards prove more useful against some scenarios than others. Haldir's probably the least useful card in the deck. Gildor carries his weight when he starts questing or when deck manipulation is vital."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=557332","commentId":557332,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1321604756,"content":"Also got a 101 in my last game.\n\nI used the restrictions that Juicebox had in mind for his tournament - 1 coreset, no AP's.\n\n \n\nMy heroes were Theodred, Gloin and Thalin. Starting threat = 26\n\n \n\nMy starting had Gandalf, Brok Ironfist and Faramir assembled, whcih is great when you have a resource driven deck. Feint is always great to havw when fighting the troll. I also had a Gondorian Spearman and the Gonolian Blade.\n\nDuring the setup I was lucky as I drew \"Despair\", so I had only to start with the hill troll in the staging area.\n\n \n\nThe first round is a blessed one, as I get Beorn on my hand and \"Evil Storm\" in the staging area. I send all my heroes to the quest and give Thalin the additional resource. Threat  = 27\n\nIn the second round I get the Dwarfen Axe Warrior and play Faramir. I send everone but Gloin questing again. The encounter deck reveals \"Despair\" again. Thalin gets the extra resource. Threat = 28\n\nThird round: My draw is Lonbeard Orc Slayer. I play no cardsEveryone but Gloin sets out for the adventure. My group has to face the Dol Guldur orcs who get one damage by Thalin's ability and who damage Thalin in revenge with 2 points.. Thalin again gets an extra resource. Then I decide to let the attack through undefended (risky, I know). Eastern Crows is the shadow card, and Gloin gets 3 damage and thus also 3 resources. Angrily he kills the Orcs with a single blow. Threat = 29\n\nBy round 4 I have enough resources to play my mighty allies Brok and Beorn. I draw Sneak Attack which allows me to play Gandalf and to engange and kill the troll in this round. My new card is Dwarfen Axe. Threat = 29\n\nThe troll is dead, but I still need some points to complete stage 1. Evil Storm enters the staging area, and leaves without hurting anyone. Threat = 30\n\nRound 6: welcome to stage 2. I draw Ever Vigilante and play Gandalf, the Spearman and an Axe Warrior. Everyone quests, only the Spearman is guarding the rear. He faces pursued by Shadows and another group of DG Orcs and dies defending. The good news is that i get through stage 2 in one turn. I enter stage 3 and reveal Necromancer's Pass and the Beastmaster of Dol Guldur. The beastmatser stays in the taging area until next round. Threat = 27 (Gandalf lowered it by 5)\n\n7th and final round: I play another Spearman that I got at the beginning of this round and send Famir and Thalin questing. The DG Orcs die as they attack the Speaman, Beorn defends against the Beatsmaster and gets readied by Ever Vigilante: the Beatmaster is killed and I win.\n\n \n\nResult: 28 threat + 7 damage + 7 turns - 4 VP = 101\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56213-anduin-vs-new-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=557522","commentId":557522,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1321635646,"content":"I'm not restricting myself to just the core set and no APs. I applaud those trying it that way but I need to kill this scenario before KD hits shelves.\n\nOver the last couple days I've tried a more aggressive tactic and tried various combinations of spheres and heroes. Was able to consistently kill the Hill Troll on round 2 using the three Dwarves (Gloin, Gimli, Thalin) but after that I just couldn't get the questing power needed to make it through before hitting 50 threat.\n\nI went back to Tactics/Lore again, but same results as before. Fail after fail. I just can't seem to draw either of my two copies of Forest Snare.\n\nHave a new Tactics/Spirit deck set up ready to go and I'll try that later. I want to ultimately defeat it without Spirit though. When I win with Spirit I feel like it was an empty victory. A tainted victory. A victory with an asterix next to it. You get my drift."}]}
