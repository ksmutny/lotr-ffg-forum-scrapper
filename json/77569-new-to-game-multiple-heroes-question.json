I'm looking to expand and I've noticed that in some expansion, you get a duplicate character but he's in a different sphere. So my question is, if I have Aragorn in my party from the Leadership sphere and my buddy has him as well but he's from the Lore sphere (or whatever the other sphere is he appears in) is that legal? Or does one of us have to swap him out since heroes are unique?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77569-new-to-game-multiple-heroes-question/?do=findComment&comment=748743","commentId":748743,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1358375849,"content":"Only one Aragorn can be on the table, regardless of sphere.  Gandalf, Boromir, Bofur, Arwen, and Glorfindel are also examples of characters who have multiple versions.  Only one copy of any of those cards can be on the table at a time.\n\nAnd welcome!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77569-new-to-game-multiple-heroes-question/?do=findComment&comment=748744","commentId":748744,"userName":"Lobaine","timestamp":1358375940,"content":"Awesome! That answers my question then! I was looking at the expansions and it blew my mind when I saw that certain characters made appearances in other spheres. Thanks a ton for your help!"}]}
