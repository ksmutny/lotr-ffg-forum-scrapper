As it is declared as an attacker or after the attack is resolved.  If the latter, then adding an extra shadow card to the Beastmaster after the attack has resolved is a bit pointless :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45804-chieftan-ufthack-dol-guldur-beastmaster/?do=findComment&comment=459190","commentId":459190,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1303801119,"content":"I think the main argument for not playing him that way (even though the wording seems that you should) is that it immediately makes him one of the most powerful enemies in the core set.\n\nI think he is pretty powerful anyway if you don't deal with or nulify him immediately, but doing 5 attack strength on the first round just seems too strong.\n\nI'm hoping FFG rule it as poor wording on one of the cards!\n\n...because i'm scared what will happen to my heroes if we do find out he really is that powerful... llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45804-chieftan-ufthack-dol-guldur-beastmaster/?do=findComment&comment=459197","commentId":459197,"userName":"Sky","timestamp":1303801841,"content":"Isn't english wording explicit?
