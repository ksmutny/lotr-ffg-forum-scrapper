It does seem odd that an Event card should include a trait, in fact it seems odd that Born(e) Aloft is an Attachment and not an Event! To me it should be an Event or an Ally, an Attachment would be the last choice for such a card.\n\nIf the Event card The Eagles Are Coming! includes a trait (which does in itself seem strange) then I would agree that it seems odd that the Born(e) Aloft doesn't include the Eagle trait.

Adding the Eagle trait would help make the card more useful, and also contribute to making The Eagles Are Coming! playable\n\n\n\nThis card 'feels' more proactive to me.  It allows for a level of planning that you don't get with SaF.  SaF is great because it allows you to play allies that would normally not be playable, but it requires you to dump cards and save resources that might be better spent elsewhere on a given turn. Of course, this doesn't really apply to the Spamdalf strategy, which SaF is great for... but it also requires dedicated Spirit resources, not AS easy to do when you're splitting Leadership/Spirit to maximize on Sneak Attack as well.   \n\nI like that Born Aloft lets me plan my defense with a little more breathing room. Bouncing an ally who would otherwise die and only needing 0 resources to do it is pretty sweet. Crack the BA after Shadow cards are revealed but before damage is dealt. So good. Works well with the Gondorian Spearman. AND it generates resources if you have Horn of Gondor in play.  It flows really naturally with other Tactics cards, IMO. \n\nAnd of course.. for those who want to use Gandalf as much as possible.  Gandalf in Planning phase. Play BA on him. Crack the BA when needed. Sneak Attack+ Gandalf.  And since this will be part of a Tactics/Leadership deck, you can get the bonuses from Horn of Gondor  and Valiant Sacrifice.\n\nKeep in mind that I don't want a large number of extremely useful cards in this game right out of the gate, though. I like a little weakness in player cards if it keeps the game as a whole challenging...minus playing Gandalf twice in one turn without having to kill him."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49175-born-alfot/?do=findComment&comment=494559","commentId":494559,"userName":"Troymk1","timestamp":1309698363,"content":" It's an action though.\n\nSo if you let the ally be rescued after shadow cards are revealed the attack goes undefended.
