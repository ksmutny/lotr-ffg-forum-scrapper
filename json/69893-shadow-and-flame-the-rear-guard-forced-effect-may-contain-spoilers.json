IMHO the end of the quest phase is after resolving the quest (which interrupts the playorder anyway) and \"committed to the quest this round\" means that it could be in the past, am I correct?\n\nThanks alot! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69893-shadow-and-flame-the-rear-guard-forced-effect-may-contain-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=681919","commentId":681919,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1345901259,"content":"Correct.\n\nIf you quest successfully and complete Stage 1B, you progress to the next stage immediately (i.e., still within the quest phase).
