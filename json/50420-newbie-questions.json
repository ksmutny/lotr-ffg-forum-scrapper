If no one is left to defend, a hero takes the full damage of their attack strength.\n\n4) You can re-assign defenders. They do not attack the same hero/ally (unless you want them too).\n\nWelcome to the boards!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50420-newbie-questions/?do=findComment&comment=503770","commentId":503770,"userName":"Veybo","timestamp":1311553716,"content":"Ironfoot has already answered your queries, but to elaborate further for your own understanding of the rules, feel free to read the below.\n\n1. Once you commit characters to a quest, by default, they cannot defend or attack due to exhaustion from being committed, correct?\n\n 2. Once a character has been assigned to defend, by default, this character cannot then attack, because they are exhausted, correct?\n\nThe start of page 14 of the rule book helps explain the above two queries.\n\n...When a card has been “used” for some purpose, such as to commit to a quest, to attack, to defend, or to use a character ability that requires the card to exhaust, it is turned 90 degrees sideways and considered “exhausted.” An exhausted card cannot exhaust again (and therefore cannot partake in any action that requires exhaustion) until it has been readied once more.\n\n \n\n3. Because of the above exhaustion factor, it's possible that enemies continue to be assigned to these same exhausted heroes after the combat phase because they not killed?\n\nReading the above it sounds like you might want to re-read page 18 of the rules and pay particular attention to the section that state \"If an attack is undefended, all damage from the attack must be assigned to a single hero controlled by the active player.\" \n\n \n\n4. During the refresh, when you reset the heroes, these enemies are automatically assigned to the same characters (from the previous round)? Or can you reassign them?\n\nEach turn during the Combat phase you get the chance to assign defenders to engaged enemies however you like (effectively re-assigning them as you say).\n\n \n\nHope that helps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50420-newbie-questions/?do=findComment&comment=505237","commentId":505237,"userName":"Direwolf76","timestamp":1311798284,"content":" Hi, everyone,\n\nThanks very much. My wife and I are starting to enjoy the game. We have a few more questions:\n\n1. Necromancer's Treachery - does this affect all heroes on the quest, or just the player's heroes who drew the card during the quest phase?\n\n2. Forest Spider: Does it always get a +1 Attack after each engagement? So 1st round engagement, +1, not killed, 2nd round engagement, +1? \n\n3. If we make 3 progress because of Legolas with Blade of Gondolin, and we are at the location with +1 Progress. The location gets +2 progress, any remaining progress gets applied to the quest, yes?\n\nThanks!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50420-newbie-questions/?do=findComment&comment=505292","commentId":505292,"userName":"noosphear","timestamp":1311810963,"content":"Direwolf76 said:\n\n \n\n Hi, everyone,\n\nThanks very much.

Creepy, cards revealing themselves from the deck... happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\nI'm assuming (and can be wrong doing it) that this \"Necromancer's Treachery\" is in fact the \"The Necromancer's Reach\" treachery card.\n\nIf I'm right then the effect of the card is: \"When Revealed: Deal 1 damage to each exhausted character\". So all exhausted characters are effected, even allies and even characters who are exhausted but not commited to the quest.\n\nIf I'm wrong, please provide the text of the card.\n\n "}]}
