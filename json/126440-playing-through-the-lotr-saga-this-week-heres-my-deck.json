You need some attachments in place, and some way to manipulate the top card of the deck in order to get the most out of it, which takes time and resources.\n\n \n\nI've been using Theodred and Sam with Gandalf, so I can play Steward of Gondor turn one, if I have it in hand. Or Galadriel turn two to try and get it.\n\n \n\nOther than that, there are a lot of similarities. I've been including a lot of high cost allies, to maximize the use of this deck's absurd resource generation. (Though, unlike an Elrond deck, I've found Timely Aid is also worth it.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126440-playing-through-the-lotr-saga-this-week-heres-my-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1323638","commentId":1323638,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1415214630,"content":"That deck should work fine.  Remember that you can play allies and attachments of any sphere with Gandalf, but you still can't play them out of phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126440-playing-through-the-lotr-saga-this-week-heres-my-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1323769","commentId":1323769,"userName":"WWPDSteven","timestamp":1415221429,"content":"I've played this deck quite a few times now and not really had an issue with getting Galadriel out.

In coop special in 3 4 players he cut his presence in other players decks and that can be very frustrating. No Sneak Attack Gandalf combo? No 4 damage or reduce 5 threat? In 4 players game can be ctitical no Gandalf ally at all.\n\nHe is good for solo yes. however I share your feeling, I dont like to broken decks like dwarfs and outlans but Nightmare fix it. We need some power. Yes I hope HON nightmare will be very difficult and we need to use powerful combo to win. They game will be on 100% power!

It took me SOOOOOOOOOOO long to beat that quest and I found it super difficult!
