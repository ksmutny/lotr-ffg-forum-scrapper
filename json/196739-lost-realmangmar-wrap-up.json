Mostly because they often didn't help againts the new quests.

I've come to appreciate the less shiny cards, so I quite like the cardpool of AtS. Dwarrowdelf is for me the worst cycle, as it really started power creep in the form of spirit Glorfindel of course, who I never play, as well as Elrond and maybe Aragorn which allows some very powerful combo decks.\n\nJust to help memories back, AtS enabled the Gondor archetype (some good allies, and Visonary Leadership, Strength of Arms), it also marked the start of the Ranger-Trap archetype (two third of the lore cards of this cycle), the Record attachmentd, Caldara, and of course Outlands.\n\nI would not argue though that AtS got the short hand hero-wise: Hirluin and Caldara enable a very particular deck, Faramir his not really good, Mirlonde Pippin and Theoden are niched"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=1956409","commentId":1956409,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1451133167,"content":"Less shiny card using is fun, no doubt. \n\nBut if you want to beat the majority of the quests you just can't use a half baked deck.\n\nThis means these cards are mostly for a theme or certain quest niche deck.\n\nWhich is fine by the way.\n\n \n\nI understand you defending the AtS cycle, and I'm not saying it just sucks or anything.\n\nTo me it is just the worst cycle on player cards to date.\n\nIMO the cycle's Leadership got no interesting cards almost.

A 'half baked deck' to me would mean that the deck is not especially well built rather than making any comment on the quality of the cards used in it. I have a Dwarf deck which I built when I was still very new to the game, thus it's not that well built and I could do much better if I built it now. But I keep it around and use it to play each new quest blind as they hit OCTGN to get a feel for the quest before trying it with other decks. It still beats a lot of quests on the first attempt just because of Dwarves, but it would be one of the first things I'd think of as a 'haf baked deck'.\n\nSecondly, I would also argue that 'less shiny' doesn't necessarily mean worse. Just less in your face \"Look how awesome a card I am and acknowledge my greatness!\" The vast majority of cards in the game I would say are less shiny than Glorfindel, Light of Valinor and Asfaloth, but that doesn't mean they're inherently worse for beating a given quest. That's actually something I felt when trying to come up with my picks for favourite stuff from this cycle - very few cards really stood out to me as being truly amazing so that I'd immediately throw them on my list, but at the same time I feel like this cycle had a lot of very good cards, they're just mostly less flashy, and/or some of them are only really good in the right kind of deck rather than just being able to just drag and drop into anything you feel like.\n\n(Also, unless you're counting Nightmare, the majority of quests are not so hard that you can't get away with using some less well-favoured cards in your decks in any case)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=1956503","commentId":1956503,"userName":"awp832","timestamp":1451143459,"content":"I'd love to see a multiplayer aragorn/Faramir deck, Pharm, I tried to make Faramir work myself with Veteran of Osgiliath, but it just barely fell flat.   "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=1956579","commentId":1956579,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1451149262,"content":"By the way, my opinion on this wrap-up:\n\n \n\nHero- Amarthiul: really good hero overall, thematic win and overall great idea to finally get a hero out of an objective ally?

So if Seastan already showed that a trap-Dúnedian deck is very good and that a non-trap Dúnedain deck is very good, why not see if he or anyone else can make a non-lore Dúnedain deck very good?\n\nWithout even really trying, you say? Did you see my mono Leadership Dunedain deck? It was also one of the first posted. Also, i am totally aware of Seastan's deck, and it's really good, but it's not what I personally wanted the Dunedain to be the most. It's a combo deck and runs Lore (which I'm not against thematically or anything like that.) I just really wanted the Leadership-Tactics (or mono with Amarthiul) deck to be really good, as aggro and L-T is my favorite deck style and fave sphere combo. Ad it just feels great for the Dunedain in flavor. That's the thing though, it's just my personal expectation and the designers are not bound to it. Same happened for me with HoN.\n\nI didn't want to sound so negative, you could maybe build a deck and prove me wrong, but I have actually tried and it' nigh impossible to make such a deck and make it effective against the current meta without Balin, not only Angmar Awakened but current saga as well. In fact, that's precisely why the deck I posted as my vision of the definitive most powerful Leadership-Tactics aggro deck runs Balin, as he gives you access to the best shadow cancelation and card draw in Leadership and Tactics. And I still believe it's probably the best deck you could make with those spheres without relying on very specific card combos, as Seastan's decks often do. (It's just not my playstyle and don't particularly enjoy it, plus it's much harder to pull off without Lore).\n\n \n\nI also want to add, there are other Leadership Tacctics decks that are really good in solo (albeit not as good) such as Core Aragorn Imrahil and Eomer, and of course Elladan and Elrohir (which will be even better with Arwen and Elvish Light.) But sadly, Aragorn (either version except for Lore), Amarthiul and Halbarad are not one of them.\n\n \n\n \n\nTotal divergence incoming:\n\n \n\nActually, now that I think of it, Lore Aragorn, Halbarad and Amarhiul can be a very strong aggro deck in general, with card draw, and access to Burning Brand. You give Steward to Aragorn so you can play Snares and Sentries, Brand, etc. You then get the Sword that was Broken so he can pay for Leadership cards. But since you're still running 2 Leadership heroes and with Good Harvest, you can still play for the other Leadership stuff easily. So then Aragorn gets Brand and Shield while Amarthiul can have Dunedain Warning x3 (easy to get with card draw and Weather Hills Watchman). So then you have two pretty powerful defenders (thought not the best), or you could attach  Song of Wisdom on Amarthiul to give him Brand. I'll definately have to try it.\n\nEdited December 28, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=1958166","commentId":1958166,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1451268313,"content":"> > > I'm still bummed that Leadership-Tactics Dunedain aggro (aka Secret Defenders) never became a thing in solo\n> > \n> > Well, let's make it a deck challenge!

With the cards you mentioned and Galadriel as well as Celebrían's Stone, which is actually an excellent card, you can get very decent willpower without much trouble. I still agree with that getting a Gondor or Dúnedain Leadership hero with lowish threat and 2 or 3 willpower would be extremely nice, but that's more for Gondor than Dúnedain, as Halbarad fills the role nicely. With Gondor you need to either run Balin or Sam, or go full Valour with Imrahil. However, I still think card draw in those spheres is lacking. While Foe-Hammer and Sneak Attack are both good (they're both 2 card combos that draw you 3 cards) even 2 card combos are a bit hard to use in these sphere, and they're not nearly as reliable as repeatable card draw like KUTM or single-card-card-draw like Daeron's Runes or Deep Knowledge. \n\nEdited December 28, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=1958215","commentId":1958215,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1451271386,"content":">  i am totally aware of Seastan's deck, and it's really good, but it's not what I personally wanted the Dunedain to be the most.

I guess you can say every deck is a combo dekc in that they need one or two cards to ge going, such as Steward of Gondor to play all your weenies, but that's the case with all spheres, and once you get Steward anything you play will advance more or less equally your board state.

I agree with many of your assessments that some of the new player card concepts introduced in this cycle are really cool, but need another card or two to feel fully developed.\n\nA few of your points don't match my personal experience, though, so I came through this cycle with a much more positive outlook on the player cards:\n\n \n\n> The Dunedain mechanic requires you to be engaged with many enemies, but they don't have repeatable ways to avoid nasty shadow cards that will inevitably hurt you as much as the attackers themselves.  They mostly have to rely on Forest Snare to make it work.\n\nI have heard this criticism of Dunedain before, but I haven't run into it in practice. I've typically been perfectly happy to discard the Dunedain Watcher for any attack that would kill a hero--and that has usually been enough. Granted, I haven't played a Dunedain deck through the entire Angmar Awakened cycle (I ran them through Land of Shadow, the first five quests of Lost Realm + Angmar Awakened, and a few random nightmare decks from Mirkwood and Dwarrodelf) so maybe Angmar Awakened has overall worse shadows than other quests.\n\n \n\nThat being said, if you want more shadow control, there are options other than Dunedain Watcher. Loragorn, Beravor, Ring of Barahir, or Song of Wisdom all grant access to Burning Brand. Idraen or Celebrian's Stone grant access to Hasty Stroke. Tireless Hunters is pretty much made for Dunedain. You could even try sticking Dark Knowledge on Amarthiul to help you know when you can risk a weaker defender.\n\n \n\nI'd love to see a Dunedain hero that has some repeatable way to discard shadow cards, but I'm not sure it's required before we can declare Dunedain to be viable.\n \n\n> I'm also not too excited about the new Noldor discard mechanic.  It relies too heavily on Erestor for the card draw.  I suspect Erestor will be the most played hero of 2016 and everyone will be fighting over who gets to use him.\n\nMy wife and I have built quite a few Noldor discard decks lately, and only one of them has had Erestor in it. Galadriel, Arwen + Elven Light, or a Lore hero can all provide the card draw needed to power the discard stuff, so Erestor is not always required!\n\n \n\nI've been really enjoying Noldor decks recently--I can't wait to see what new toys we get in the Grey Havens box.\n \n\n> I'm not into player side quests.

The only times I've seen much benefit from the side quests are when we are trying to avoid a keyword like battle or siege, but that just feels like cheesing the quests.\n\nIt's super weird that they introduced player side quests in the same cycle that typically punishes having multiple quests in play. As I play through Angmar Awakened, I keep including side quests in my deck and then cutting them on the second playthrough because I don't want to get punished for putting them down.\n\n \n\nI've really enjoyed using them in other quests, though--especially using Gather Information in place of a third copy of a unique card.\n\n \n\nSo anyway, that's my two cents!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=1968257","commentId":1968257,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1451795557,"content":"Those are some good points about Dunedain.  I just feel like they generally need to be engaged with 3+ enemies during combat (and 2+ during planning) to make their allies, Amarthiul, and Heir of Valandil worthwhile.  Maybe Burning Brand or shadow cancellation can stop 1 or 2, but to get the full effect you need serious shenanigans like Forest Snare, Thicket of Spears, or multiple Unexpected Courages to go with Burning Brand.\n\n \n\nI think the problem with Dunedain, Valour, and Noldor (at least for now) is the size of the card pool.  It's impossible to flesh out a whole new deck archtype in one cycle and have it compete with the existing archtypes unless they make the new cards very powerful.  But that would then lead to power creep and have other issues.  So, I'm not sure what else they could do.  Maybe if they made the whole cycle focused on a single archtype they could do it, but that's unhealthy for the game as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=1968288","commentId":1968288,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1451797388,"content":"I mostly agree with you Teamjimby, however, there are tons of ways to make new cards \"compete\" without being overpowered.

In fact, that's precisely why the deck I posted as my vision of the definitive most powerful Leadership-Tactics aggro deck runs Balin, as he gives you access to the best shadow cancelation and card draw in Leadership and Tactics. And I still believe it's probably the best deck you could make with those spheres without relying on very specific card combos, as Seastan's decks often do. (It's just not my playstyle and don't particularly enjoy it, plus it's much harder to pull off without Lore).\n\n \n\nYou did sound a bit defeatist, even though you made a really cool Leadership Dúnedain deck! I don't agree you 'need' shadow cancellation in solo except for a few specific quests (probably Carn Dum in this cycle). The Dúnedain deck I ran against this cycle doesn't include Burning Brand or Dúnedain Watcher and in my last run of consecutive quests I won IoC, TWH, DD, EfMG and AtE all in my first try. Went 3-3 against Wastes of Eriador. To me, that's what I call 'viable'. \n\n \n\nMaybe you've grown a little too dependant on Balin for your playstyle? And while you are free to want to stick with a Balinesque playstyle and hope for more leadership alternatives, it might be an idea to try to learn to play around shadow cards against.\n\n \n\nMy Denethor-Palantir-Rossiel deck, now that's 'Not Viable'! I spend 10 turns manipulating the encounterdeck to my exact liking, didn't have anything to actually WIN the game once I got setup.\n\n \n\nNow that I have all packs I'll definately want to try an Aragorn(T) Halbarad Amarthiúl deck out.\n\n \n\n> I'm also not too excited about the new Noldor discard mechanic.  It relies too heavily on Erestor for the card draw. \n> \n>  \n\n \n\nHave you tried Elven Light?

For me, the Silvan deck was a little bit too 'designed' by the creators as was Outlands in the cycle before that. IMO Seastan build the 'best' Dúnedain deck, while FFG build the 'best' Silvan deck.

Iarion's inclusion in two quests made me care more for him. Every storytelling fibre of my being knew that Amarthiul's mentor would not survive so I wasn't motivated to rescue him. I liked Amarthiul too. He started out pretty bland, but after saving you in the various quests, I grew fond of him. His stats tell us his personality (it's risky to block with him but you do so anyway). Having him as a hero made me happy, so we can have him travel with us in new adventures.\n\n \n\nThaurdir was a great enemy. Starts out story wise with an ambush, and as an enemy card, he is pretty relentless. Having him return in three quests also made me look foreward to finally beating him. Winning Carn Dum was therefore one of my favorite moments in the game, because it's such a well deserved victory over an enemy I was looking foreward to defeating for a long time! Daechanar on the other hand was a bit anti-climactic after dealing with Thaurdir. We get little buildup for his character so he just shows up and we kill him. Didn't help that I got really lucky in my first try and easily beat the quest.\n\n \n\nI would like to see more emphasis on 'new' characters with continuation.

No matter how many defenders you can ready with Descendants of Kings or Strength of Arms, no matter how big you can make your Guardians of Arnor, shadow effects will bite you in the a**. And no, Dúnedain Watcher is not even close to enough. Sacrificing your precious Dúnedain for a 1-shot shadow cancel? Most of the cases it's not worth it.\n> \n>  \n> \n> 2: Card advantage. After the 4th or 5th round, your hand WILL eventually run out of steam. You'll have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on. You will depend entirely on the topdeck and if you draw a useless Steward or any other unique, it will be hugely detrimental. Dúnedain -hell, Leadership in general- NEEDS some way to draw cards other than King Under the Mountain, or else the deck will depend entirely on the 12 or so cards you get withing the first 5 rounds. And yes, Balin is great for both card draw and shadow cancelation, but I'm sick of running him in all of my Leadership decks.\n\n \n\nI've been experimenting with a Halbarad, Aragorn(T) Amarthiúl deck. It's not where I want it to be yet, but I remembered your comments and found them very relatable. My first version ran out of steam quick and got smashed by some nasty shadows. But I've been having some succes in dealing with this.\n\n \n\nFor card draw I use Sneak-Attack-Gandalf-on-steroids\n\n3 x Sneak Attack\n\n3 x Reinforcements\n\n3 x Gandalf (core)\n\n3 x Sarn Ford Sentry\n\n \n\nSince the point of the Dúnedain deck is to keep several weaker enemies around, Sarn Ford Sentry often works just as well as Gandalf for card draw. This makes the combo much more reliable than just with Gandalf. I also use Erestor (for the uniques and if desperate for combo pieces) and Rallying Cry. The last one let's you use Gandalf again for tons of resources, but it also let's you sneak attack Sarn Ford Sentry AND let her die to blocking whithout losing your combo piece. I've also used it to keep Dúnedain Watcher around after using her ability. Once you hit Valour, Rallying Cry adds a lot of value for a single card, helping you keep up with the encounter deck without losing the card-advantage game. (Between Steward of Gondor and Amarthiúl I feel confident enough in my resouce gathering to replay lost allies that get returned to hand.)\n\n \n\nLandrovel (another good Reinfocements candidate) and Honor guard also help deal with unexpected shadow cards that kill heroes. Should I get my deck where I want it to be, I'll post it in the strategy section. I do feel some of these cards can help your mono-leadership Dúnedain deck as well get more where you want it to be. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=2010647","commentId":2010647,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1453696418,"content":"Hero: Arwen Undómiel\n\nAlly: Ranger of Cardolan\n\nAttachment: Steed of Imladris\n\nEvent: Elven-light\n\nSide Quest: Gather Information\n\n \n\nLeadership: Descendants of Kings\n\nTactics: Derndingle Warrior\n\nSpirit: Elven-light\n\nLore: Galdor of the Havens\n\nNeutral: Ranger of Cardolan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=2013140","commentId":2013140,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1453788351,"content":"I am looking at the above top 10 of sorts and nodding with agreement.
