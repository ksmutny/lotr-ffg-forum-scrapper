Each riddle effect will list criteria for you to \"answer\" (e.g., \"The first player names a sphere and card type.\"). You then shuffle your player deck, discard a certain number of cards (dictated by the riddle effect) and add one progress to Stage 2B for each card that matches ALL the criteria on the riddle trigger. So, using the above example, you might call \"Lore ally.\" You'd then shuffle and discard the top few cards (usually two or three), adding one progress for each Lore ally you discard. If you don't find any matches, Gollum attacks Bilbo. Lastly, Bilbo's Magic Ring allows the hobbit to spend his resources in order to discard additional cards during a riddle attempt. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69522-1st-hobbit-quest-solo/?do=findComment&comment=683065","commentId":683065,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1346073948,"content":"sounds interesting….come on tomorrow…hurry up!

When playing this scenario I usually try to keep my threat low enough so that I only have to fight one of the trolls at a time. I think everything else will not work, no matter how good your deck might be.\n\nMy first deck was built around Dáin as the main defender, pimped up with some Dunedain Warnings, Chain Mails and Arwen. The troll killer was Erebor Battle Master, who had an attack value of 7-10 with all these dwarves in play. So the plan was to delay the second stage until I had EBM and enough dwarves out, but not delaying it too long to avoid a fight with two trolls. Khazad-Khazad and Heavy Stroke are nice cards that help EBM to kill the trolls with one single blow. Instead of EBM you might also use Gimli + Citadel Plate.\n\nMy second deck was spirit/lore with the aim to play as many cheap allies with much WP as possible. Westroad Traveller, Erebor Record Keeper, Escort from Edoras, Arwen etc. Some of them got sacrificed to the trolls, the others allowed me to quest like the wind so that I gathered enough progress to complete the adventure before the trolls could even blink.\n\nBtw, both stragies also work against S&F.\n\n \n\nIn your case I'd say that you should combine these two with one player defending (and perhaps attacking) and the other one questing. Remember you don't need to defeat the trolls, as the sunlight will take care of them once you have enough progress.\n\n \n\nRe: Gandalf - I used the new version but it was quite counter-productive in this (in fact in all three) scenario which is why I dropped him. The old Gandalf might help, but since FoS I don't use him anymore. If you want to use him though, you probably should add Grave Cairn to your deck. Play Gandalf with Sneak Attack (or with Born Aloft) and use his ATT for one of your other characters."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69522-1st-hobbit-quest-solo/?do=findComment&comment=699074","commentId":699074,"userName":"ArachneJericho","timestamp":1348428239,"content":"wlk said:\n\nArachneJericho said:\n\nThe most enemies that can engage you at a time is two: one is optional and your choice, the other forced.

That almost certainly means running Core Gandalf (rather than new Gandalf, unless you have threat under really good control), definitely Galadhrim's Greetings, and at least one Dwarven Tomb to recycle a Greeting. If you run with Nori, every dwarf you play will reduce  your threat by 1---a big advantage if you're running almost all dwarven allies.\n\nThe dwarf heroes in OHaUH have synergy with large numbers of dwarves in a deck---Ori draws cards based on having five+ dwarves in play, and Thorin does the same for his excess resource generation. This is why the set resonates so well with the Dwarrowdelf cycle. Every additional dwarven ally counts.\n\nEven without the Dwarrowdelf cycle, though, there are still a lotta dwarven allies.\n\nI think you can do things with Thorin, Ori, and Nori; and as many dwarven allies as possible. That gives you Spirit, Leadership, and Lore: and gives you resource generation, card draw, and threat reduction. Card draw will be particularly essential to getting any deck off the ground, and you need every draw in this quest. You want five dwarves in play STAT as soon as possible; fortunately, you can get your pick of cheap dwarves with Zigil Miner, Erebor Record Keeper, Miner of the Iron Hills, Erebor Hammersmith. More expensive dwarves like the Longbeard Map-Maker and Longbeard Orc Slayer are hardier, and with excess resource generation from Thorin, the Slayer can be more reliably played.\n\nStick in the Galadhirm's Greetings and the Dwarven Tomb. Add in more card draw support, like Ancient Mathom. Remember that Gandalf (Core) can also give you cards. Durin's Song will help, as may Ever Onward. You also have access to Dunedain Mark. And naturally Steward of Gondor. If you have a Song of Wisdom on Thorin, you need not worry about not having enough resources to pay for Lore allies.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69522-1st-hobbit-quest-solo/?do=findComment&comment=700283","commentId":700283,"userName":"ArachneJericho","timestamp":1348584452,"content":"I came up with a decklist containing nothing but cards from 1x each of Core, Mirkwood Cycle, and Khazad-Dum, ETA: and Over Hill & Under Hill.

But it was an extremely close win---this deck is fragile preciseley because some of the best cards from Core only have two copies. A Test of Will and The Galadhrim's Greeting stands out among these cards. However, I managed to pile in enough dwarves and dwarven allies to keep the dwarf synergy with the heroes going after turn 2.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n- The Galadhrim's Greetings could not have come later and still have me win the game. It was, like I said, a very close thing. They kept me from having two trolls engaged at the same time.\n\n- Gandalf was also, for some reason, in the second half of the deck. Good thing Ori had serious card draw; at the end of the game, only three cards were left in my deck.\n\n- Fili and Kili popping out together was a surprisingly huge help. 2 dwarves for 3 cost is amazing.\n\n- A Test of Will was so necessary to deal with treachery-heavy decks that I recycled one with the Dwarven Tomb. Hasty Stroke also helped, since some of the shadow effects are equally nasty.\n\n- I had no choice---I had to engage the trolls from least to greatest. Things got easier after the second troll died.\n\n- Bilbo kept sacks away. Thorin was a sack magnet, so I had to exhaust Bilbo and pay threat to keep trolls engaged. :-/\n\n- Unsacked by Bilbo, Thorin had two Dunedain Marks on him, and with plentiful application of Durin's Songs, managed to kill the smallest and the middle trolls before I took on the big guy (who I actually chose to engage for once).\n\n- Protector of Lorien played a huge roll in keeping threat down during the endgame with the trolls by turning card draw into will power. The Map-Makers also helped---every Lore resource helped.\n\n- With the final troll engaged to me already and killing one of my allies, a final Gandalf managed to damage him and then, with the help of Thorin, kill him.\n\n- I got the Key, but it was attached to the final troll and everybody was too busy killing him to explore the Cave properly. Closest I have ever gotten to the treasures.\n \n\nEdit: final score -\n\nThreat: 37\nDead heroes: 0\nWounds: 0\nVictory points: 12\nTurns: 14\n\nso… 165.
