When playing with Dunhere (Hero) his ability states he can attack into the staging area. Can you provide input what this means. Does this mean he can attack any creature he wants without engaging it? (The creature would not get to hit back?\n\n \n\n2.) If you have a character you are questing with, and you have an ability to read it can you quest with it again doubling it's \"WILL\"?\n\n \n\n3.) If a character card has an \"ACTION\" that states to excaust it for something to trigger, can you send them on a quest and exauset at the same time and will that character quest and be able to trigger the effect?\n\n \n\nThank you,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174647-questions-for-new-player/?do=findComment&comment=1600308","commentId":1600308,"userName":"krokodiler","timestamp":1430408474,"content":"1. It means exactly what is written: he attacks an enemy which is in a staging area, not engaged with you or any other player.\n\n \n\n2. No, yo can only commit a character once and his Will counts only once.\n\n \n\n3. When you commit a character to a quest you (usually) exhaust him/her. That character must be ready again to perform an Action that demands exhausting.\n\n \n\nHope this helps :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited April 30, 2015 by krokodiler"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174647-questions-for-new-player/?do=findComment&comment=1600433","commentId":1600433,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1430412754,"content":"To add on question 3.

So I'm clear he can attack into the staging area, but does that mean he can deal damage to the creature in the staging area without worrying about the creature hitting back?\n\nSo it's like free damage?\n\nEdited May 1, 2015 by Luciant559"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174647-questions-for-new-player/?do=findComment&comment=1602840","commentId":1602840,"userName":"OlorinCZ","timestamp":1430551410,"content":"Yes.\n\nIf you can keep that enemy in the staging area (threat lower than him or woth help of some cards) you can do it.\n\nDuring the combat phase:\n\n1) all ENGAGED enemies make an attack against player(s)\n\n2) than you can declare attackers agains engaged ememies.
