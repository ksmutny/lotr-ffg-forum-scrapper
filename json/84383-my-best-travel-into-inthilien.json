I have had a few wins on round 5, this was the first on round 4 also. I used to run Thalin here a lot, always hoping for the Forest Bats, haha.\n\nI did get the Bats this time (without Thalin) and it was the only three damage the heroes received (2 from the ability, 1 from the undefended attack). It was also the only enemy engaged throughout the game. I like the Beregond approach also but somehow I feel safer in running through the quest (via stage 3). Outlands really shine here, yes, but (Leadership) Boromir also. However, it was the two copies of Risk Some Light that allowed us to quest without risking much, without it all the Knights of the Swan (together with other Outlands) would have been destroyed.\n\nHmm, Glaurung, it is a bit weird what you write here. I've heard you saying Dwarves had been broken for about a year, yet you post a ton of videos playing with them. And you seem plenty proud in those, at least you don't forget to mention the videos in every other post you write. But now you think one shouldn't be proud of a good result, just because you didn't make a video of it? I also saw you glorify an Outlands deck on bgg. Do you suffer some sort of dual personality problem that you are so incosistent with your opinions, or you just cannot take the fact someone does better than you?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84383-my-best-travel-into-inthilien/?do=findComment&comment=799551","commentId":799551,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1369712236,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nlleimmoen said:\n\n \n\nRiding on a sudden wave of pride, I was wondering what is your best score (solo or coop, but especially 2-player) against the second Heirs of Númenor quest Into Ithilien.

Actually i try Outland deck against SF and i cannot win. Every time you Z Traitor he kill all of my allies. Maybe i still dont have experience.

And I believe with some encounter card combos, one is bound to lose some games no matter how much experience he's got or how good his deck is.\n\nI also believe the designers do a pretty good job of preventing some deck strategies from developing, especially on the newer quests. Thus, an untimely Zealous Traitor, Blocking Wargs, or the Master's Malice can ruin the day.\n\nHowever Outlands do get the nice safety cushion with Anfalas Herdsman, a legacy that most of the other factions do not have right now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84383-my-best-travel-into-inthilien/?do=findComment&comment=800036","commentId":800036,"userName":"Gunny_J","timestamp":1369836775,"content":"Congrats!  I was also pretty happy when I beat this quest.  I posted my success as well.  I don't use Dwarves, so that was even better. I have been working on Siege of Cair Andros, and it is proving to be just as challenging.  These Heirs of Numenor quests have been great in their design, but brutal in their encounter cards.  It's almost not fun, tbh.  I tried doing easy mode Into Ithilien, but it removed half the deck.  I haven't tried Outlands yet, so I'll have to see how they do. "}]}
