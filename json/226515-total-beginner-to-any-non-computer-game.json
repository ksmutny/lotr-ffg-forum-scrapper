I was look pretty long for a solo board game. After many final decisions ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I found that LoTR LCG suits me at best even that it is my first card game and second board game. I even didnt know what LCG means.\n\nWhile I wait for my order which unfortunately was delayed for a week I took opportunity to get familiar with this forum, BGG resource and other links mainly proposed here. But I never look into sites which shows how cards look like or any deck building tips. I wanted to start by my self.\n\nI ordered Core Set + hunt for Gollum + dead marshes + two first saga expansion [not Hobbit]. Yes it was all bet. Succesful.\n\nEasy i thought after reading scenario reviews for Core Set (no spoilers ofcourse), I decided that I will build Hobbit deck and I will not use prebuilt one. After recieving my order, I built Deck which I named Old man guide newbie\". So Bilbo Bagins, Pippin and Merry.\n\nNo spoilers also...\n\nI was pretty sure it will not take time to finish first scenario if everywhere it is noted as easiest one. It took me 4hours :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] But I won. I finished it after 18 rounds have 38 threat points I took all my cards and only one left on adventure pile. (sry im using polish version, not sure right now how it is named in english). As many mentioned Gandalf was executioner of scenario.\n\nMy deck wasnt sucessful. I have too much cards on the hand. To low on resources. And most frustrating was lack of willpower to adventure thru the lands. In many rounds i was equal to staging cards.\n\nBut all Heroes return to homes healthy. So there is room for improvment.\n\nSo once again thank you for your community and Regards. I'm really happy I got this game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226515-total-beginner-to-any-non-computer-game/?do=findComment&comment=2340746","commentId":2340746,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1470236091,"content":"Its a fantastic game and is very hard at first with core box adventures, but after a lot of failure the knowledge of decks and cards gets easier and it all gets much better.

You may try The Hobbit early, but it helps to have a few small expansions first. The later LotR sagas I'm not sure of, but I expect the difficulty with only early cards to be higher. Each saga comes with deck lists (partially?) based on the contents of the box, but they won't necessarily make the scenarios easy.\n\n \n\nStandalone scenarios differ. I only have one, which seems doable with relatively few cards. Others I'm certain are made with the card pool at its release in mind (anything with big battles for sure).\n\n \n\nYou can expect products to spend 4-6 weeks at the printer, then 4-6 weeks on the boat. Once a product arrives at FFG's warehouse it takes roughly 1-2 weeks before all stores have it. US stores may get it earlier, but there's usually a street date they have to follow. So two and a half excruciating months from finished development until a chance at holding it.\n\nEdited August 4, 2016 by evilidler"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226515-total-beginner-to-any-non-computer-game/?do=findComment&comment=2343596","commentId":2343596,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1470350427,"content":"Playing in order if release is excellent, i do it.

Got a lot of catching up to do. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226515-total-beginner-to-any-non-computer-game/?do=findComment&comment=2348755","commentId":2348755,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1470499523,"content":"Awesome and well done even if you did make a slight hiccup, we all do when starting (and later too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )\n\nLorien guide is only for locations not active quest, but no matter you had fun :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nGreat that you loved it.\n\n \n\nI played Passage through Mirkwood quite a few times to get used to how the game played but also the strengths and weaknesses of each sphere. I didnt manage to beat it with Spirit and NOBODY beats it with just a Tactics sphere.\n\n \n\nWhen you move onto Journey Down the Anduin it gets haaaard and you will have to start considering if you will mix spheres so make a full 50 card deck of two or three spheres to manage to tackle the quests difficulties, this is where you really start to think about deck building closely. Its hard and took me ages to beat but once you have it feels great. Just remember its the fun in the adventure not the win, as this gave makes you lose a lot more often than you win, so you have to enjoy losing.\n\n \n\nEscape from Dol Guldur is still today considered one of the hardest quests ever in the game, so by all means play it (The mechanics of finding items, maps etc is all good stuff) but dont expect to win and I wouldnt dwell on it too long.\n\nThe MIrkwood cycle is then all kinds of fun. Some people dont like some quests because they focus too much on one aspect, eg Hills Of Emyn Muin is mainly location management, but for me thats an aspect of the tutorial-type nature of that cycle and I loved it. All the Mirkwood cycle quests are doable with an average deck if you give them a few goes and experiment tweaking your deck, so its great fun.\n\n \n\nAfterwards, I loved the Dwarrowdelf Cycle, but did find it harder and so some of the quests in that were not QUITE as much fun as Mirkwood, though most people prefer Dwarrowdelf LOL. The first Dwarrowdelf quest smashed me sooooo many times but when I finally hit on a deck that worked, it was like it was a self contained game all in itself. The adventure and my deck were so nicely balanced that you could replay it so many times and it was win/lose on how the deal went and how I chose my plays, which was excellent I replayed it like that many times :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nSo good luck and think of all the excitement to come, healing escort quests, long journeys, big monster fights, castles, forests, dungeons, mines, cities, hunting out spies, murder mysteries, dragons, fortress sieges, covert operations, battlefield assaults, sea journeys and ship battles and so so much more. Each adventure deck being different makes for an almost unlimited amount of variety in the game only limited by the designers imagination.\n\n \n\nGreat you are loving it, welcome to the experience :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226515-total-beginner-to-any-non-computer-game/?do=findComment&comment=2348814","commentId":2348814,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1470501273,"content":"Passage through Mirkwood, a.k.a. Stroll through the Scenery, is a good test for your decks when starting out, but there are spheres which struggle with anything alone. I always go for two spheres per deck, although the secondary one might be just a few cards and a hero to support it for particular problems. There's usually more oomph with a bodyguard deck (second hand with mainly Tactics/rangers). Pure hobbit decks may also have better sneakiness options.\n\n \n\nEscape from Dol Guldur must have been made during a divorce, or as an alternative to waterboarding.\n\n \n\nDwarrowdelf: There are balrogs. Plural! I think five of the bastards got to Arda back in 0000 or thereabouts. Don't go in alone.\n\nBring dwarves.\n\n \n\nThe standalone scenarios are nice for quick play too. Some of them may give a deck which breezed through any of the cycles a bit of a challenge, and you only need your decks and the contents of each. Same with sagas, although there's mixing of encounter sets to do. You just don't use any core encounters.\n\n \n\nI finally got the Hobbit saga completed and I like the cards I got. I have 90 new player cards usable for anything, and 8 new heroes. Bilbo is the fifth hero in each set, and only usable with those. Both sets together really make dwarf parties great."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226515-total-beginner-to-any-non-computer-game/?do=findComment&comment=2352571","commentId":2352571,"userName":"Madjack0707","timestamp":1470664697,"content":"Ok, another question.

During that at some point the next saga comes out. So it kinda spaces out to one a month ish.\n\nThis is only a guess, many more people have a more accurate timescale.\n\n \n\nWhen I started in this game I had zero experience in deck building games at all. And so far, given enough time to experiment, I have beaten all the quests I have attempted so-far (Except Dol Guldur) so I know how you feel and all I can say is done worry just keep trying (and read Beorns Path :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226515-total-beginner-to-any-non-computer-game/?do=findComment&comment=2353714","commentId":2353714,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1470690782,"content":"> I don't know why people encourage buying the Mirkwood cycle, either.

It's not a fun way to learn or play.\n\n \n\nProxy the good player cards and and buy one of the later cycles first.
