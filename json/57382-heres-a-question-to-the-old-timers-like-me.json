DM and EM was really bad!!! many players around me stop to play in this moment.My community is broke up cose if you already build up decks which can win against Osgiliath in August so next 2 quests DM And EM(september, Oktober) is just walking in the park with bandage on the eyes.\n\nI still not get RTM but look like this one is good.So we will gather together again!!!\n\nThe most important part of this game is Quests and Encounter cards. If they will make boring and easy quests game will die very quick.\n\nBut they understand this so second cycle looks much more better then the first one according the preview articles.\n\nSo the bigest my hope lies on the Second cycle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57382-heres-a-question-to-the-old-timers-like-me/?do=findComment&comment=566571","commentId":566571,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1323659728,"content":"I play at lot less mostly because I stopped playing solo.

But we never really liked playing \"Escape from Dol Guldur\" much, because we found it a bit too difficult. (Since then it has become one of our favorites, because of that extra difficulty...)\n\nPhase 2: Feeling the need to get a second core set, because of the limited deck building options. After that we started to build two new decks, one leadership/lore and one spirit/tactics, also \"upgrading\" to 50 cards per player deck. The impact of this was huge. And we played even more games after that...\n\nBetween Phase 2 and 3 and during a holiday in Ireland I discovered the Cardboard of the Rings podcast! And the rest of the summer we waited for the arrival of \"Hunt for Gollum\".\n\nPhase 3: This is where the game really started to shine, because the adventure packs started to come out regularly! Since then we've continued playing, improved our decks and also went back to plow through some of the older quests.\n\nA short while ago and after the release of the Dead Marshes we went back to building mono-sphere decks which has turned out to be also great fun..."}]}
