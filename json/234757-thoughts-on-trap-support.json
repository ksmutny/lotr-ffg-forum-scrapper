The theme of traps is to not know what is coming and hopefully prepare the right trap. If you can just selectively move them, they become pretty OP and then you can do that with Forest Snare. Keep an enemy from attacking, kill it, but move Forest snare to someone else right before you do so that a new enemy can't attack. An infinite chain of disabling enemies. Get three out and you can move 3 traps from an enemy to someone else. Also thematically what are you doing? Helping one orc out of a trap then shoving a different one in?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234757-thoughts-on-trap-support/?do=findComment&comment=2505811","commentId":2505811,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1479421971,"content":"Agreed the effect would be powerful.  However, make it an exhaust ability and a planning action on a 3+ cost unique ally and I don't see it as any more overpowered than Anborn.\n\n \n\nIs it \"unthematic?\"  Theme is in the eye of the beholder, and the very first trap (Forest Snare) does not participate in the place-before-reveal mechanic of other traps.  If you can accept placing a Forest Snare directly on an in-play enemy as \"thematic\", you should be able to rationalize moving one as the original victim escaping, but the other blundering into the same trap.\n\n \n\nPersonally, I don't think it's terribly thematic for the first enemy to fall into every trap placed for him.  Surely it is just as plausible to lay out poisoned stakes and ranger spikes as *separate* traps than to put every trap you have into one Rube Goldberg contraption that catches the first enemy and only the first enemy.  That traps work the way they do is a results of mechanics, not theme, IMO.  I'd welcome a way to ameliorate it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234757-thoughts-on-trap-support/?do=findComment&comment=2505832","commentId":2505832,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1479422944,"content":"> put every trap you have into one Rube Goldberg contraption that catches the first enemy and only the first enemy.  \n\n \n\nThis is my favorite thing to imagine now.  Aragorn setting up a very complicated, convoluted connection of traps to trigger on the first unsuspecting enemy. \n\n \n\nThe first series in any good Rube Goldberg trap machine has to be Entangling Nets.  After the enemy is ensnared, their weight in the nets sets off the next reaction, pulling up a series of Poisoned Stakes, jabbing the enemy forcefully they bounce into the air, pulled slightly by the nets further into the machine. They land in an Ithilien Pit - and what pit is complete without a series of Ranger Spikes there to poke holes in all the right places.  As the blood drains from the enemy, it sets off another pulley, jerking the holey enemy out of the pit, where they find that they were actually in an Ambush the entire time and didn't notice THAT was actually the first trap in the series!  Then, as they sit there confused at all the madness they've been through just to engage him, Aragorn drapes a Forest Snare over them and laughs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234757-thoughts-on-trap-support/?do=findComment&comment=2507595","commentId":2507595,"userName":"Hawkstrike","timestamp":1479561824,"content":"Where do we get more traps?
