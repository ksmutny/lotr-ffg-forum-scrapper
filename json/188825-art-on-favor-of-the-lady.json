The shadows in the face don't necesarily have to form a perfect light-to-dark sequence sometimes, particularly when there's a secondary source of light on the other side, like in this case. You can see it more clearly in the cup itself. Also the shadows on her right eye are totally possible depending on the orientation of the light. \n\nEdited September 23, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188825-art-on-favor-of-the-lady/?do=findComment&comment=1813800","commentId":1813800,"userName":"ppsantos","timestamp":1442993935,"content":"I understand the secondary lighting and how it affects shadow formation.  As a visual artist myself, it's easy for me to notice unnatural shadows.  The lady's face does not have abrupt or sharp edges/contours to form dark shadows right next to a very bright spot.  It's just not possible.  Also the secondary lighting, being weaker than the primary lighting should have produced the darker shadows on the secondary lit side of the face, again because the cheeks don't have sharp corners or abrupt edges.\n\n \n\nOver-all, the wrong shadows detracted from what would have otherwise been beautiful artwork. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188825-art-on-favor-of-the-lady/?do=findComment&comment=1815873","commentId":1815873,"userName":"jnicol","timestamp":1443057488,"content":"I agree that the light/shadow on the cheek is quite extreme, but I do think that such an abrupt shadow is possible with a very specific lighting setup.\n\n \n\nSomething like this:\n\n \n\nhttp://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/photo/portrait-of-young-man-black-and-white-low-key-royalty-free-image/108223726 [http://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/photo/portrait-of-young-man-black-and-white-low-key-royalty-free-image/108223726]\n\n \n\nAdmittedly I know nothing about Magali's working process, but her work looks to me like it is based on photographic references, which might explain the dramatic lighting in this painting."}]}
