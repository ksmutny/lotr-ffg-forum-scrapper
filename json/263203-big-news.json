As much as that bogs me down, it has to be a digital version.\n\nI do hope that they make the app/soft support the physical card game too. You could play with your actual cards while the app would manage the campaign aspects, with, YAY!!!, a generic campaign mode.\n\nThat campaign mode could very well give you some kind of \"money/credits\" to \"buy\" equipment, new allies, etc. I don't think It would be that hard to balance with a companion app, and other 7 years, I've seen so many attempts at doing that kind of campaign mode. Heck, all those progression modes are nearly that, aren't they? You could auto-win some cards as you progress, and spend credits/experience/whatever to get the \"most powerful ones\".\n\nWhat always dissuaded me from doing a progression-style thing (and that is why we opted to make our own campaign mode [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1214867/tale-years-mega-campaign-mode-lotr-lcg] with friends) is that the physical card pool management is not as easy IRL as playing on OCTGN. An app would help that. Remember which cards you purchased and which you did not, etc.\n\nEDIT: also European readers, the twitch of FFG is announced 11AM CT, that's 6 PM on the continent and 5 PM in the UK.\n\nEdited December 9, 2017 by banania"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3117289","commentId":3117289,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1512804508,"content":"I highly doubt it is LotR LCG Digital, but I will rejoice if I'm wrong."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3117319","commentId":3117319,"userName":"Trialus","timestamp":1512809153,"content":"I can't refute the logic of this idea, but am pretty sure that I would still just stick to my physical cards.  Wouldn't really be psyched to put any money into a digital version after the hundreds of dollars I've invested in the physical cards.  Not to mention the whole \"I play card games when i don't want to play video games\" piece. \n\nIf true, I'm sure there is a way to do it that draws in new players and pleases established players as well without resorting to the slimy practices that have been plagueing video games of late, but don't know if it'll be for me.  \n\nEdit after seeing a few of the other recent posts made while I typed...some sort of companion app/campaign mode would be really cool.  Like that much better than a straight digital version of LOTR LCG.\n\nEdited December 9, 2017 by Trialus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3117420","commentId":3117420,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1512821800,"content":"Digital card games usually cost far less than physical ones, so it is not like you'll need to spend the same amout of money to play digital.\n\n \n\nAs a person with very little time due to day job, the things about digital card game that I can appreciate is full automation and quickness of the tideous irl activities I must perform, like if I want to change my deck, I'll need to sit swapping cards for some time.

Even the card artworks somehow look bad, even though they are the same as the physical version... There are so many great location artworks and it looks that they are substituted by at least second class 3D animations. I could go on, but this really has to improve or it will be hard to enjoy. Hopeully it looks better in motion.\n\n2. Everything about the gameplay has to wait until there is at least a recorded match to see the changes in action. \n\n3. Randomness. Oh god why. The change to sneak attack (now simply summoning ANY random ally) doesn't feel good to me. I play Hearthstone and can live with the use of randomness there. But it was there all along. I know the lotr LCG works wihout extra randomness and now it gets added. I know the ups and downs of random effects and see why they can be fun, but I will always prefer to have as less as possible. \nAlso the theme of giving you the feeling of laying out a trap for the opponent is gone and now it's just this \"Deus ex machine\" feeling, that you know that \"Someone\" will appear to hopefully save the day.\nAdding to this: Sneak attack havin this new effect means it can't have it's old one. Meaning the effect will be completely gone, because why create a new card for an existing effect, when you can just use the ols one. I fear this could be a sign of reduced interaction via events during the \"adventuring\" phase, focusing on \"minion smashing\" :S \n\n4. AI. A double edged sword. If the AI is weak the game will crash and burn. Noone wants to play against a dumb AI. But as they say that threat is still in the game I think this will \"somehow\" influence which cards the AI can play agains you making it relative for it to play the \"strongest cards\". Silly combat decisions will be a blowout too. Tasking an AI with all the decisions we did outselfs for so many years is dangerous an for me it was a very fun part \"in multiplayer\" to figure out how to distribute the enemies. Sad to see this go :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\n5. This being a f2p-game is no surprise and I can live with it, as there enough ways to keep the game accessable without money, while offering incentive to invest some, if you can afford it. Obviously we have to wait for the prices.\n\n6. But now the most important point for me: Caleb works on the game. No matter when I see or hear something from him, he always seems so full of passion for the game and Lotr in general and I can't imagine him advising or implementing (not sure how big his role in the development of the digital version is) a change he doesn't feel good about. So even with all the questionsmarks above, I still have hope that the final product will be great once I get to play it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3118226","commentId":3118226,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1512872117,"content":"If I can play a game in ten minutes in an off moment fine.  If I can keep playing my beloved LOTR LCG great.  If the designer for both is the same person...

I mean, digitalness of the game allows for TONS of cool stuff to be done, not just random... but to take a perfectly fine and iconic original card that had a cool effect that involved deckbuilding (ok, who am I kidding, it involved including neutral Gandalf into your deck, but still), and just water it down to a button with \"random\" on it? That seems like a very poor use of digital potential to me. If digital Sneak Attack stays that way, then I predict that people will stop using it as soon as card pool grows and decks can be filled with cards that player can predict and control. Imagine if they change Gandalf from choose to random? Man, this is not how use the random effect to the game's advantage."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3118591","commentId":3118591,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1512911487,"content":"If the phases have been simplified out of existence, Sneak Attack with a chosen ally would be much more powerful than it is in the real game, where the sneak contribution is limited to one phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3118601","commentId":3118601,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1512912528,"content":"> 16 minutes ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> If the phases have been simplified out of existence, Sneak Attack with a chosen ally would be much more powerful than it is in the real game, where the sneak contribution is limited to one phase.\n\nYes, that Keen-eyed Took will be a huge contributor throughout the entire adventure phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3118606","commentId":3118606,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1512913098,"content":"Sneak Attack is most commonly used with core Gandalf, and in a simplified no-phase game a sneaked core Gandalf is exactly as much good as a full-price Gandalf, with the bonus that he stays in your hand at the end of the turn.  Sneak Attack is already a leadership staple, making it dramatically better by removing its one restriction (single phase) would indeed be overpowered.\n\nSo instead it becomes pot-luck like Imrahil.  You might get Gandalf, but you also might get Keen-eyed Took.  It's not our sneak attack, but it may end up being a Really Useful Card all the same."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263203-big-news/?do=findComment&comment=3118631","commentId":3118631,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1512914220,"content":"He isn't unless you bring readying effects.
