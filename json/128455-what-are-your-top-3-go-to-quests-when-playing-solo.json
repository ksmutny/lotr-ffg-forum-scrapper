I'm so glad I made that purchase as the game has become my favorite coop tabletop game. Since that time I've played almost all the scenarios in the game (only normal scernarios I have not played are the last 2 Hobbit Quests and most of the Nightmare scenarios. I think Battle of Laketown has scared me away from Smaug and the Lonely Mountain and Nightmare quests are just that). I thus own a wealth of LOTR:LCG quests but if I want to play a game on the fly I tend to gravitate to a handful of quests. This made me curious to see what the community likes as their go-to quests. For me, a go-to quest has a variety of elements that meet my definition of \"fun\". Typically, those elements are moderate challenge level, interesting quest mechanics, and a solid thematic element. With that said, here are my current Top 3 Go-To Quests for solo play in no particular order:\n\n \n\n1) Massing at Osgiliath - not nearly as hard as it was in the early days, I still really like MaO. I love the way the quest cards change up the locations effects, I enjoy the combat fun, and I like the plot element of having to flee from Osgilliath with the Witch King in pursuit. It's also fun to have Rangers pop out of the Encounter deck from time to time.\n\n2) Journey Down the Anduin - I was hooked right away by the challenge of fighting a huge enemy right out of the gate. I also love how the quest card dynamics change from stage to stage.\n\n3) Shadow of the Past - If I'm playing this one, its for the story and I'm playing it with my Hobbit deck. I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's writing. As such, some of my favorite material is the Hobbits' flight from Hobbiton to Crickhollow. Cards in this quest such as Green HIlls Country, Bamfurlong, Piercing Cry, and Crawling Towards Him really convey the story to me. I also think A Knife in the Dark conveys the story well, but that I find that quest a much steeper challenge, so I tend not to play it nearly as much as this one.\n\n \n\nHow about you all? What are your Go-To Quests and why?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1356911","commentId":1356911,"userName":"Calyx","timestamp":1417729272,"content":"I think my two go-to quests are Journey Down the Anduin and, surprisingly, Into Ithilien. I also like The Morgule Vale. I think these three quests place a premium on both questing and combat; they can be very difficult (though JDtA can also be super easy, if you are lucky), and really push decks. If I am playing multiplayer, I would also put Foundations of Stone up there. This quest isn't too difficult, but it is quite fun - the separation mechanic is great.\n\n \n\nI just got a hold of The Three Trials, and I think this one might become a favorite as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1356919","commentId":1356919,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1417729675,"content":"Only 3.. Journey Down the Anduin is such a classic but my choices will be...\n\n1) Encounter at Amon Din: Pretty easy and always fun saving villagers and I frequently add some dead villagers to the one objective card to make things more challenging.\n\n2) Fords of Isen: Instant favorite, so many things to like about this quest its always fun.\n\n3) Siege of Cair Andros: get a good solo deck and you can smash though this pretty fast and avoid a lot of added difficulty multiplayer brings but the theme and feel of battle is still there which I love!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1357040","commentId":1357040,"userName":"Greyhound78","timestamp":1417736118,"content":"I play only solo and my 5 most favourite scenarios:\n\n \n\n1) Massing at Osgiliath (my favourite quest, not so hard but very good)\n\n2) Steward´s Fear (hard quest, very fun with hidden robbers and villains under locations)\n\n3) Encounter at Amon Din (easy for many variable decks, i like to save the villagers)\n\n4) Khazad-dúm (i like dwarfs and this expansion is very good)\n\n5) Siege of Cair Andros (super quest for sphere of tactics, Beregond a Legolas :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited December 4, 2014 by Greyhound78"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1357079","commentId":1357079,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1417738316,"content":"I only have shadows of mirkwood, both hobbits, Khazad-dum, red-horn gate, the long dark, massing and lake-town so my selection will be limited on quest, but I still have havs.\n\n1)Massing: gotta go with this one.  not to hard, thematic, lots of enemies.\n\n2)over misty mountains: love this quest.  can't do it to many times.  lots of enemies and start out with a giant in the game.\n\n3)journey down the anduin:  same as above.  what a great quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1357154","commentId":1357154,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1417743699,"content":"I actually am not obsessed with Journey down the Anduin.  It's fine, but definitely not a go to quest for me.  My top solo:\n\n \n\n1) Stewards Fear - Incredible amount of replay value, very strong theme, a good challenge, very capable of countering very good decks that usually smash quests.  Feels like a real \"quest\" like you're really trying to complete a mission\n\n \n\n2) Massing at Osgiliath - You don't need to hear the same comments on this quest again.  Same as above.\n\n \n\n3) Nightmare KD\n\n \n\n4) Any of the other Against the Shadow quests"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1357321","commentId":1357321,"userName":"divinityofnumber","timestamp":1417758659,"content":"In no particular order:\n\n \n\n1) Watcher in the Water (Dwarrowdelf Cycle)\n\n2) Steward's Fear\n\n3) Druadan Forest\n\n \n\n \n\nAlso, like Khamul above, I really enjoy KD Nightmare and all of the AtS scenarios. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1357388","commentId":1357388,"userName":"player1922162","timestamp":1417768028,"content":"Return to Mirkwood is particularly interesting in solo, Into Ithilien, and Morgul Vale as well as Black Riders and Road Darkens..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1357696","commentId":1357696,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1417793634,"content":"When i test a deck i usually play: Anduin, 7th level, Massing Osgiliath"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1372093","commentId":1372093,"userName":"jormungandr","timestamp":1418986415,"content":"MaO, JatA, Into Ithillien"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1372174","commentId":1372174,"userName":"13nrv","timestamp":1418995869,"content":"1) Anduin\n\n2) Into the deep\n\n3) Steward Fear\n\n4) Dunland trap"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128455-what-are-your-top-3-go-to-quests-when-playing-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1372211","commentId":1372211,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1418999379,"content":"Hmmm really difficult to make a choice… thank to Nmode we have many good quests now!\n\nTop 3?
