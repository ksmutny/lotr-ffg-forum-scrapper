Maybe you don't make engagement checks while at a safe location or something similar. \n\nI get why they need to be objective locations now; they have the guarded keyword. Having a side quest be the card guarding an objective (location objective in this case) is pretty gnarly and obviously new. Far more reward than normal for clearing the side quest but also far more important to do so and not something you can just ignore now! (not that many of them can be easily ignored..... they are all pretty brutal and I personally always try to quickly clear and get rid of them) "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184993-second-breakfast-in-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1733960","commentId":1733960,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1439445759,"content":"Baby troll is epic!!!!
