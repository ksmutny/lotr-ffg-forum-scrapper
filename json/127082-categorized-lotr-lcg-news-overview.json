(As it creates a community in which the fans are more involved with each other).\n\nWhat I would like to see is FFG occasionally linking to fan articles to help build the community more. (They already do support the fan sites in other ways, but a direct, hey check this out, might be nice in the news feed sometimes). "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127082-categorized-lotr-lcg-news-overview/?do=findComment&comment=1335866","commentId":1335866,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1416095671,"content":"When was the last time we saw a Second Breakfast article?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127082-categorized-lotr-lcg-news-overview/?do=findComment&comment=1335967","commentId":1335967,"userName":"X_BryGuy_X","timestamp":1416107739,"content":"Thanks for doing this!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127082-categorized-lotr-lcg-news-overview/?do=findComment&comment=1336896","commentId":1336896,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1416211180,"content":"> Man, it's fun to go back and read the preview articles before the game came out.

When I was sitting in my empty cave gnawing on bones and eagerly waiting for the game to release! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Funny thing is, that I also started playing Arkham Horror and then checked out the ffg site to find out they just anounced a lotr card game. Upon which I registered here at the forums and been following the game closely ever since. Although not always that active in the forums ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\nThanks for the awesome overview, it's really a lot of fun to browse through these articles! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited November 17, 2014 by faith_star83"}]}
