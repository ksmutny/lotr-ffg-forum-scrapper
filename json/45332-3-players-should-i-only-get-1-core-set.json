They are incomplete in number and type of cards to prove capable of overcoming hard quests as they are at the moment by using just single sphere decks (at least most of them, I believe). You can probably get over the first quest, but second and third are a complete different story. That means you need to combine at least two spheres and thus, two players can play with reasonable probabilities of being succesful.\n\n \n\nThat´s how I see it at least.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45332-3-players-should-i-only-get-1-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=456230","commentId":456230,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1303269214,"content":"Mighty Jim said:\n\nObviously you could proxy it with any means of counting from 1-50, but a large part of the appeal of FFG games is the high quality of the components, so it might spoil things a bit if two you have moving threat trackers, and the third player has a sheet of paper with lots of crossings out...\n\n\n\nWell, lugging huge game boxes around makes me grateful for every component I don't have to carry with me. Just like I don't bother with the board/drain markers for CoC I don't see myself using the threat trackers. If I just need to bring a deck box or two that's a lot better."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45332-3-players-should-i-only-get-1-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=465048","commentId":465048,"userName":"Griffonstone","timestamp":1304796055,"content":"Well I just a finished playing a 3 Player game with one core set.

Since the \"evil guys\" stack is reshuffeled once used, there are also no problems with this one.\n\nBut one thing changes:\nSince in one box there are only two hill trolls e.g., you cannot draw four at once, which could happen (with a low probability) in the case of two core sets. In other words, just one box would reduce the maximum risk.\n(ofc it also decreases the probability of drawing four times a boring/safe card.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45332-3-players-should-i-only-get-1-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=472909","commentId":472909,"userName":"BeardFan","timestamp":1306119914,"content":"You NEVER mix up encounter decks from multiple coresets.

Basically, although you can play with 4 players with a single box (providing you proxy threat trackers) they don't provide enough cards in a single core set to build 4 50 card legal decks.\n\nTherefore, they could have said a single core set supports 4 players (and added a couple of extra threat trackers), but then the community would have possibly complained it didn't really support 4 players because of the lack of cards. So instead they say it was 2 core sets for four players and now they get some areas of the community (not  saying this relates to anyone on this thread) saying that you don't need two sets for 4 players and to say so is just a money making scheme for FFG.\n\nIn TheSpaniard's own words, they were damned if the do and damned if they didn't.\n\nAll in all though I think they got it about right, as other people on this thread have already said, if you want to do any kind of deck building with 4 players, you really need two core sets or several adventure packs (and we don't have any of those yet!)\n\n "}]}
