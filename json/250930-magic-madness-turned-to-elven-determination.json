You might remember (but most probably you don't) that time when I discussed possibility of Madness and Delirium keywords from MtG in the LotR, just for the fun of it. Well, not long ago my \"game design itch\" started again, so I've decided to act a bit more upon that long forgotten discussion, and I also decided to challenge myself by limiting the amount of cards I do by the usual size/sphere disparity of a regular Adventure Pack. Also, I am sorry in advance with the names and art, I didn't felt like spending entire day searching for stuff. With that said, I present you with Determination (keyword description is on the first ally card):\n\nPTTq9eG.png [http://i.imgur.com/PTTq9eG.png]\n\ncHkgJSK.png [http://i.imgur.com/cHkgJSK.png]   bdMN7HQ.png [http://i.imgur.com/bdMN7HQ.png]\n\ntLdBCli.png [http://i.imgur.com/tLdBCli.png]   UPTSvIS.png [http://i.imgur.com/UPTSvIS.png]\n\nzMGPqgm.png [http://i.imgur.com/zMGPqgm.png]   doaWO6I.png [http://i.imgur.com/doaWO6I.png]\n\nAfiWRcO.png [http://i.imgur.com/AfiWRcO.png]   TaF6TQz.png [http://i.imgur.com/TaF6TQz.png]\n\nv0iop3a.png [http://i.imgur.com/v0iop3a.png]\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/250930-magic-madness-turned-to-elven-determination/?do=findComment&comment=2811112","commentId":2811112,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1496078437,"content":"Some of the \"is\" of yours should be a \"are\", I'd say.\n\n \n\nAlso: Ageless Grace in a Noldor discard deck is insane powerfull!\n\nEdited May 29, 2017 by Flrbb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/250930-magic-madness-turned-to-elven-determination/?do=findComment&comment=2811279","commentId":2811279,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1496088220,"content":"There most certainly are.

She does not brings anything to the table (other than her mediocre stats) until you do that, hence the little leg up in terms of 1 threat cost reduction.\n\n \n\n> 1 hour ago, Bullroarer Took said:\n> \n> Love where you're going with this, but I agree some of the cards are undercosted.\n\nThey might very well be, I spent only a couple of hours coming up with them, after all. But, we all should keep in mind the powercreep that is currently happening in the game, because recently that official card was released: \n\nMEC58_60.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/MEC58_60.jpg]\n\nEdited May 30, 2017 by John Constantine"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/250930-magic-madness-turned-to-elven-determination/?do=findComment&comment=2811696","commentId":2811696,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1496120775,"content":"With Erestor, Lauriel will due to your starting hand begin the second round already ridiculous. \n\nI agree on the rider of Rohan thing though.

But I think discard noldor strategy is already a thing. Not because all the cards are good but because some specific cards are very powerful (Arwen hero, Galdor, elven jailer, elven light, glorfindel ally and to the sea! to the sea!). It is even a basic for Caldara strategy, and I think Caldara is the second best deck. I also use them in Noldor specific strategy, for example:\n\nhttp://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5319/noldor-for-solo-get-a-4-5cost-ally-each-turn-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5319/noldor-for-solo-get-a-4-5cost-ally-each-turn-1.0]\n\nhttp://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4681/arwen-galadriel-galdor-incredible-consistant-deck-for-m-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4681/arwen-galadriel-galdor-incredible-consistant-deck-for-m-1.0]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/250930-magic-madness-turned-to-elven-determination/?do=findComment&comment=2812004","commentId":2812004,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1496150134,"content":"Having an event in your discard can be done without even trying (Elrond's Counsel, Dearon's Runes, etc.). Having an attachment in your discard is almost as easy (Cram, Lembas, Miruvor, etc.). The only slightly difficult thing to get in your discard is an ally, and even then it's so easy. Eowyn, Arwen, Legolas, Galdor, etc. can do it trivially on turn 1, same with the aforementioned Daeron's Runes. Cards like Elven Spear and To the Sea can get all 3 types of card in the discard at once. I am pretty sure I could satisfy Lauriel's condition in a standard Noldor deck every game before the first quest phase without even changing much.\n\nWith this in mind, I consider almost all the cards here to be undercosted. Urban Spy is fine. Ageless Grace is straight up broken. I can have one on each hero?\n\nI like the determination keyword, but not the \"card types in the discard\" mechanic. I feel like you've underestimated how easy it is to do. It's also not exciting, since I just do it on turn 1 and then forget about the mechanic afterward because it's always satisfied from then on."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/250930-magic-madness-turned-to-elven-determination/?do=findComment&comment=2813081","commentId":2813081,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1496173713,"content":"Determination adds a very nice touch to the discard mechanic. \n\nHaving a mechanic interact with the discard pile is a nice idea too, as there isn't much else then playing around with stuff in the victory display or playing/buffing a handfull of cards from the DC-pile. But I have to agree that just putting 3 card types there to tigger something is way to easy and boring.\nTo make it more interactive/fun you could try to tinker with a \"banish\"-mechanic. To tigger a specific effect/buff/etc. you need to banish an amount of card(types) from the DC-pile and game (they wouldn't go to the victory display). For example: Noldor noble's determination has X equal the number of cardtypes you banish.\nOr Lauriel gets +1 stat for each different cardtype you banish until the end of the round (you could limit it to max 1 per stat if you don't feel like allowing 5 attack).\nFor Ageless grace you could say 3 cardtypes need to be banished to play it.
