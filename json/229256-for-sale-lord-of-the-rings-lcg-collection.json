Maybe each cycle as a whole. Anybody who needs that full of a collection just started the game and probably not willing to jump in feet-first for $600 on everything; and anyone willing to is probably already well caught up on releases.\n\nIIRC this is your second post on the matter, which means you had no luck the first time around. Yeah it's a minor inconvenience packaging and going to the post office repeatedly, but if people are willing to reimburse for shipping costs, you'd offload these much much faster.\n\nMay I repeat my offer of just the LOTR Saga boxes?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229256-for-sale-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-collection/?do=findComment&comment=2746930","commentId":2746930,"userName":"kahira1533","timestamp":1492882068,"content":"Rob, are you still looking for a buyer for your collection?"}]}
