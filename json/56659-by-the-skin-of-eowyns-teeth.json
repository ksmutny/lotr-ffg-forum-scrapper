In anticipation of it, I had readied Aragorn and Boromir and dealt a card to activate Eowyn's effect. I had to go for it all, there was a Hill Troll engaged and a Giant Marsh Worm waiting in staging, so things were not promising. Also, my threat had reached 43. Here's how it went:\n\nAragorn+Favor of the Lady=3\nBoromir+1=4\nEowyn+effect+5=9\nWandering Took+1=10\nDunedain Watcher+1=11 total willpower\n\nGollum had 3 counters, so I revealed 3 cards:\n\nImpassable Bog=2\nThrough The Mist+3=5\nThe Lights of the Dead+5=10 escape\n\nWow, by the barest of margins! If it wasn't for the card I decided to use on Eowyn, I would have been done. I was thinking that no way all 3 cards would have escape values. With 11 willpower stacked against it, it should be easy. I guess it goes to show you. Cover all your bases, or you will regret it. I believe this is the closest escape I've ever had.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56659-by-the-skin-of-eowyns-teeth/?do=findComment&comment=559128","commentId":559128,"userName":"Puzzle2","timestamp":1321997565,"content":" Wow, three out of three cards with escape values is brutal on that. Smart move discarding to boost Eowyn.\n\nI have done the same thing on two occassions in this scenario. I basically go for broke and discard my entire hand."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56659-by-the-skin-of-eowyns-teeth/?do=findComment&comment=559215","commentId":559215,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1322016967,"content":"I had a similar situation with Massing at Osgiliath (solo play, as for now my first and only victory): All or nothing - i committed everyone to the quest, payed a card for Eowyn and activated Faramir - Outcome: exactly the needed amount of progress tokens on the final quest - the enemys in play would have killed me the following combat round :S"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56659-by-the-skin-of-eowyns-teeth/?do=findComment&comment=559827","commentId":559827,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1322126559,"content":"Here's another even more ridiculous one and I swear I can't make this up:\n\nI'm on my last turn as my threat has reached 49 and I have yet again an engaged Hill Troll(shouldn't these guys be hanging around, I don't know, in the hills?). Anyway, I have to win here and now. The quest card has no counters, but outside of Gollum, the staging area is clear. I quest Aragorn+Favor of the Lady, ready him, and commit Escort from Edoras. Here's what happened:\n\nWolf Rider+1 and surge.\nEastern Crows+1 and surge\nAnother Eastern Crows+1 and surge\nGoblin Sniper+2\n\n5 threat against 7 willpower and the encounter deck just put the screws to me. I'm one counter short. I resolve Gollum's regular escape test, no problem. Then everyone, even the darn Goblin Sniper engages me! I let one Crows attack, and then purely out of spite, I sacrifice Boromir to activate his second effect. He blows up the Wolf Rider, the two Eastern Crows, the Goblin Sniper and the badly damaged Hill Troll. 5 enemies in one fell swoop! Good ridance! And then, of course, I lose, lol. Reminds of how Boromir went out, killing a bunch of enemies and still failing to protect the hobbits."}]}
