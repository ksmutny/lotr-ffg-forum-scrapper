The product page changed a bit. It's only showing one product for the new expansion/AP and it's not Heirs of Númenor, it's the first AP for that called: The Steward's Fear.

So they are in the correct places now.\n\n \n\nI think the next month or so will be slow news, against expectations with an upcoming film and all but I believe it is because of the upcoming film that we will see slow news from the game systems already out there (this LOTR LCG and Cubicle 7's The One Ring) all because I believe there are new upcoming products (board and card games mostly) from companies who have gained the rights to Hobbit stuff in the last year, plus FFG have just released a Hobbit card game which is not a LCG btw - http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3555&epn=0 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3555&epn=0]\n\nOn the plus side we have now 4 new LCG sets to expect soonish -\n\n \n\nBattle of Lake-Town Print On Demand set\n\nThe Hobbit: On the Doorstep Saga Expansion\n\nHeirs of Numenor Deluxe Expansion\n\nAgainst the Shadow Adventure adventure pack set - #1 The Steward's Fear\n\n \n\nand 5 additional sets to the Against the Shadow adventure packs.\n\nThings are looking good, just be patient with the actual releases, I think we'll see a little slow down as more and more Hobbit related stuff pours out."}]}
