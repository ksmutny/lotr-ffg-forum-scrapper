It is pretty obvious to me he is a MTG artist as well as his depiction of Glaurung is strikingly familiar and very similar to a bunch of dragons that were released shortly before I stopped playing MTG.\n\nThat one of Glorfindel fighting the Balrog has become my new phone screen  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nHope you all enjoy these are much as I did!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188425-eric-velhagen-high-res-tolkien-art/?do=findComment&comment=1795635","commentId":1795635,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1442285740,"content":"Amazing art.
