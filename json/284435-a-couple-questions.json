Only events, since the planning phase is the only time you may play attachments and allies.\n\n3. Same answer as two.\n\nThere should be a round sequence chart at the back of your rulebook/learn to play guide that shows you when you can take what actions. I also recommend downloading the FAQ and Rules Reference from FFG. They answer pretty much any question you might have about action windows or anything else."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3501344","commentId":3501344,"userName":"icabod","timestamp":1539362517,"content":"For questions 2 and 3, Event cards are the only cards that you can play outside of the planning phase, assuming there is an action window.

So for example if you reveal a shadow card that says \"deal 1 damage to defending character\" this damage is dealt before you can play e.g. a healing event, potentially killing the defender. However, cards such as Hasty Stroke specifically respond to shadow cards being revealed, so you can play them.\n\nHowever, you can play actions between resolving the card and completing the enemy attack, so if the shadow card says \"attacking enemy gets +1 attack\" you can play an event that gives the defender +1 defence before the attack resolves.\n\nEdited October 12, 2018 by NathanH"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3502907","commentId":3502907,"userName":"Stewart777","timestamp":1539518688,"content":"Ok so I just started my first game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I'm following the rules and am playing a pre-made starter deck from Spirit.\n\n1.

So you basically have to have tokens on the main quest at all times otherwise you lose?\n\n- Secondly, as the bold text reads, do you really have to be able to place progress tokens on the quest in the first round?! And if you don't you lose the game? I ask because the setup instructs you to also put a Location into play (I chose one with a low token requirement, \"Narrow Alleyway [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Narrow-Alleyway-TSoH]\", which requires 2 progress tokens). That would mean you have to almost commit all your heroes to questing which would leave none to defend or attack with.

It ask me to really think about the game, to deckbuild better decks than I use to do before. There is better scenario since (they keep improving many things) but it was the moment where I go from \"playing the new AP once with a friend\" to \"getting involved in the game and thinking about it diversity\" due to the excitement of the challenge.\n\nSo, the success of Heir of Numenor it seem to depend of who was playing it ^^.

The enemy still attacks as normal during combat as well .\"\n\nThe final part of this doesn’t correspond with the Online Rules Reference booklet which states:\n\n6.4a The active player (starting with the first player) chooses an eligible enemy that he or she is engaged with to resolve its attack. An eligible enemy is one that has not yet attacked this round and is still able to attack. \n\nTherefore an enemy that made an immediate attack before the combat phase cannot make another attack. It has already made an attack this round.\n\nIs there something I am missing?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3669102","commentId":3669102,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1554474380,"content":"Well, 6.3 on the same page also say that each enemy engaged with a player will get an opportunity to attack during the Combat phase, but no, I don't really think you're missing something in the text of the Rules Reference. However I am certain that if you submitted a rules question Caleb would confirm that immediate attacks do not prevent the enemy attacking normally in the Combat phase as well.\n\nAs a relevant precedent, players are also restricted to only declaring one attack against each enemy per round, but this limit is circumvented by card effects which grant attacks (like Quick Strike, Haldir, Hands Upon the Bow, etc). It makes sense that the same principle would apply to enemies - attacks triggered by card effects don't count as their one framework attack for the round.\n\nEdit - And now I see this was answered properly in other threads.\n\nEdited April 5, 2019 by PocketWraith"}]}
