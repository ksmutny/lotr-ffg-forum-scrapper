Only events, since the planning phase is the only time you may play attachments and allies.\n\n3. Same answer as two.\n\nThere should be a round sequence chart at the back of your rulebook/learn to play guide that shows you when you can take what actions. I also recommend downloading the FAQ and Rules Reference from FFG. They answer pretty much any question you might have about action windows or anything else."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3501344","commentId":3501344,"userName":"icabod","timestamp":1539362517,"content":"For questions 2 and 3, Event cards are the only cards that you can play outside of the planning phase, assuming there is an action window.

So for example if you reveal a shadow card that says \"deal 1 damage to defending character\" this damage is dealt before you can play e.g. a healing event, potentially killing the defender. However, cards such as Hasty Stroke specifically respond to shadow cards being revealed, so you can play them.\n\nHowever, you can play actions between resolving the card and completing the enemy attack, so if the shadow card says \"attacking enemy gets +1 attack\" you can play an event that gives the defender +1 defence before the attack resolves.\n\nEdited October 12, 2018 by NathanH"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3502907","commentId":3502907,"userName":"Stewart777","timestamp":1539518688,"content":"Ok so I just started my first game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I'm following the rules and am playing a pre-made starter deck from Spirit.\n\n1. Question - I have dealt out my 6 cards starting hand, put 3 resources on the heroes and drawn one card. The card is Stand and Fight with text:\n\n \n> Quote\n> \n>  \n> \n> Event. Cost: X.\n> \n> Action: Choose an ally with a printed cost of X in any player's discard pile.

So technically it could be any amount.\n\nSecondly I don't have a discard pile yet... so does this card just get put in the discard pile or shuffled back into the deck?\n\n \n\n2. Also, what happens to card Actions that rely on 2 players for the effect to occur? For instance, I'm playing a 1 player game and have Wandering Took as an Ally in play with the text:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Action: Reduce your threat by 3 to give control of Wandering Took to another player. Raise that player's threat by 3.\n\nDoes the text just get ignored? Because that is a huge disadvantage as I could reduce my threat by 3...\n\n \n\n3.

Too many locations and enemies (2 Beastmasters  with 2 threat level and two Necromancer's Pass with 3 threat level!) in the staging area and so my threat level just kept increasing and so had to engage the 2 Beastmasters, a King Spider and a Chieften Ufthak simultaneously... hopeless.\n\nThis game is hard.
