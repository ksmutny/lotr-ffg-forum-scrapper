For me and my partner we have gotten....\n\nMirkewood (Ungolant's Spawn Path)-- 68 Score\n\nMirkewood (Quest Path)-- 59 Score\n\nJourney Down the Anduin-- 70 Score\n\nEscape From Dol Guldur -- Haven't passed 2 player yet only 3 player. The 3 player game was a almost fail we had 45, 47, 48 threat levels.\n\nWe used x2 Gandalf cards as well as cards from all the first cycle of expansions in our decks and one person using a Warrior/Spirit deck and the other using a Leadership/Lore deck.\n\nJourney Down the Anduin was particulary  tough failed it 4 times because of the second Hill Troll popping up at bad times and smashing us into the ground. Nevermind the annoying treachery cards dealing damage to all characters that are comminted to a quest and killing heros in the process because of damage done by the Hill Troll.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58256-what-is-everyones-best-scores-so-far-for-2-player-core-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=573212","commentId":573212,"userName":"Vase","timestamp":1325374931,"content":" I haven't scored these yet with the new scoring system.  But I'll add you as a friend, and when I get around to scoring them, you can compare."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58256-what-is-everyones-best-scores-so-far-for-2-player-core-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=580892","commentId":580892,"userName":"ichaos1985","timestamp":1326818489,"content":" Hey, \n\nI played the first scenarios only, with my wife.\n\nFInished the first with 146 points, the second one (Down the Anduin) 202. Those brutal treachery cards killed all of our \"little\" allies.. \n\nWe played with leadership and lore decks, as they came in the starter box. Thrilling. \n\n \n\nBut we really enjoyed it. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58256-what-is-everyones-best-scores-so-far-for-2-player-core-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=580903","commentId":580903,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1326819294,"content":"I do not use the new score system, but I have scored 58 in Passage with my friend and 61 in Anduin."}]}
