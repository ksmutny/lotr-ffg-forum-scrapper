I think the question is how literally will \"finding\" Ungolianth's Spawn is to be taken. If it's already in play, is it considered found? What if it is already defeated? Some players actually talked about \"shepherding it\" with some damage until the quest comes up and then defeating it, which seems somewhat cheap and not in the spirit that it was intended. My own personal take is that it must be found and defeated while that particular quest is active."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45575-a-chosen-path-dont-leave-the-path-question/?do=findComment&comment=457184","commentId":457184,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1303400848,"content":"It is all one quest, merely a different stage of it.

If you pull Beorn's path at stage 3, you don't ever need to face U-spawn, so if you face it before stage 3 you still have a chance of not having to face it again.\n\nI think the offical ruling is a sound one."}]}
