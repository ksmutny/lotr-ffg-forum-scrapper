Hope you enjoy it. \n\n \n\nWith the core set, Mirkwood cycle packs and Khazad-Dum you should be set for a while. After that I would recommend the 6 Dwarrowdelf cycle packs (connected to Khazad-Dum) or the Black Riders saga expansion which has some great player cards. But really, I'd take it slow and figure out if you like the game in the long run before you start spending.\n\n \n\nAnd someone always makes sure to link Beorn's Path [https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/] to new players.

But all are fun.\n\n3: game opens up more as you get slowly used to new cards.\n\n4: how many diffetent scenarios are available to buy???? Isnt that awesome!!! You dont get that with a 1vs1 card game.\n\n5: did i mention the game is awesome.\n\n6: so many variations, change the scenario and need to change the deck. So varied.\n\n7: welcome again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nIm playing things slowly, extensively and in order of release... its GREAT!\n\n \n\n:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175046-just-picked-up-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1604309","commentId":1604309,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1430696058,"content":"To add more info:\n\n \n\nNew Player Guides [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/new-player-guides/] from Tales from the Cards\n\n \n\nespecially:\n\n \n\nNew Player Buying Guide [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/]\n\n \n\nand \n\n \n\n5 Things i wish i would know when starting playing LotR LCG [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/5-things-i-wish-i-wouldve-known-when-i-started-playing-lotr-lcg/]"}]}
