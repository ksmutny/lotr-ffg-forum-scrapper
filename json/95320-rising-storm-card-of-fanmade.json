Also, I'd re-word the first sentence:\n\nWhen Revealed: Discard 1 progress token from each hero in play. Each hero may be exhausted instead of removing a progress token from it. Then, remove 1 progress token from the current quest card for each exhausted character in play.\n\nI think that's the clearest and most grammatically correct way I can think of."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95320-rising-storm-card-of-fanmade/?do=findComment&comment=933397","commentId":933397,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1387367526,"content":"This is my actual version after the latest posts:\n\n \n\ne2o9.jpg [http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/1453/e2o9.jpg]\n\n \n\nThe idea is like:\n\n \n\nffg_old-wives-tales-thfg.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_old-wives-tales-thfg.jpg]\n\nwith the text:\n\nWhen Revealed: Discard 1 resource from each hero's resource pool, if able.

More simple than first card.\n\n \n\n \n\nBut \"Rising Storm\" is about progress tokens, so you can't say: \"pay X progress tokens\", but also not \"discard\" i think.
