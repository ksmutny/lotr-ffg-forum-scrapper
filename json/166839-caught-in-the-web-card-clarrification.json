Other cards with readying effects (Unexpected Courage, Grim Resolve, Common Cause) can also be used during the action window in any phase to ready the hero who has Caught in a Web attached to him.\n\n \n\nDid this help?\n\n \n\nEDIT: GrandSpleen beat me to it… :-)\n\nEdited April 12, 2015 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/166839-caught-in-the-web-card-clarrification/?do=findComment&comment=1563612","commentId":1563612,"userName":"paganeagle2001","timestamp":1428880225,"content":"Thanks for helping, I wasn't sure if the attachment continued until I paid the 2 resources or if it went as soon as I readied the hero.\n\nNow I see that it continues.\n\nMany thanks.\n\nAll the best.\n\nRichard"}]}
