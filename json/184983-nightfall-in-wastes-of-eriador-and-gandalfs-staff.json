Was I right?\n\n \n\n(...because, dangit, I don't want to annul my victory. I managed to survive *four* straight attacks from the Pack Leader due to drawing Northern Warg as a shadow card thrice in a row, and literally all of the damage I did to it was from Descendant of Thorondor's Response effect, which made it a hugely entertaining win.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184983-nightfall-in-wastes-of-eriador-and-gandalfs-staff/?do=findComment&comment=1733852","commentId":1733852,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1439435038,"content":"Yep, you can discard shadow effects with the Staff at night.
