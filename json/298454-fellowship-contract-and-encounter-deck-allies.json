I obviously want it to work, but I'm a little biased. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298454-fellowship-contract-and-encounter-deck-allies/?do=findComment&comment=3756749","commentId":3756749,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1565056073,"content":"Cool question! The RR defines playing quite precisely, then leaves putting into play more up to card text [<http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule564 [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule564]>]. You're certainly not playing the Encounter allies, and they are just as certainly entering play (from the encounter deck). But did you put them into play?\n\nI don't think so! As I just said, putting into play is pretty much defined by card text, and the When Revealed abilities of the Ranger/Eagle of the North don't even have the word \"put\" on them. Indeed, if anyone put them into play (not clear to me this is true, but for the sake of argument), it wouldn't be you anyway—it'd be the encounter deck, and the contract specifically says, \"You cannot play or put into play…\"\n\nSo I think you actually can bypass the restriction in the way you stated."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298454-fellowship-contract-and-encounter-deck-allies/?do=findComment&comment=3756769","commentId":3756769,"userName":"Levanthalas","timestamp":1565058150,"content":"Cool! That was basically my line of reasoning as well. Sometimes the fine print really is on our side. \n\nTime to make the Grey Company Fellowship deck with 3 extra characters!! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298454-fellowship-contract-and-encounter-deck-allies/?do=findComment&comment=3770695","commentId":3770695,"userName":"Schrodinger&#039;s Hat","timestamp":1566719880,"content":"Interesting, would this also mean that cards which say “put into play under any player’s control” could also bypass this if they are coming from another player (as it is not “you” putting them into play)? \n\nI don’t even know if it would be helpful, but it’s interesting to know."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298454-fellowship-contract-and-encounter-deck-allies/?do=findComment&comment=3772934","commentId":3772934,"userName":"noctum_carpe","timestamp":1567000014,"content":"yeah that rohan guy that removes shadowcards?
