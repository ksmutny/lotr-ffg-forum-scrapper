I don't think so as Narvi's belt only gives attached hero the resource icon of your choice for that phase and not the round. But I just want to check in case you can exhaust Narvi's belt and give the dwarf hero access to Burning brand to defend cancelling out any shadow effects. But then how would it attach in the first place!?! Probably answered my own question, but just checking.\n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73717-narvis-belt-burning-brand/?do=findComment&comment=718570","commentId":718570,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1351960720,"content":" Yes you can.
