But, unlike his brethren, he didn't took pleasure in what they were doing. All he felt was sorrow for those unfortunate enough to fall under their sight. Even more, he grew to hate everything he was, everything they was, and once he reached his limit, he made a decision. \n\nIn the early morning, he went into the village they were to slaughter tonight, alone, unarmed. \n\nHe tried to warn people of what's coming, but no one listened. Some ran screaming, some threw stones at him, until he was brutally beaten and taken for interrogation. He didn't cared what happens to him, all he wanted is for this village to see another day. He begged them to listen, yet every his prayer was answered with a punch to the gut or stab of a knife.\n\nThen, night fell down. One of the guards went out to investigate the approaching noise only to be met with a hail of crude arrows. Then, the screams started. All over again. He couldn't prevent what he feared most... When, suddenly, one of the rampaging orcs bursted into the building and striked the remaining guard down. When he noticed Gur'Kahath, he was surprised and immediately went to free him. Big mistake.\n\nAs soon as his hands were untied, Gur'Kahath grabbed curved sword out of the other orc's hand and punctured his throat with a single powerful thrust. Then, he noticed that guard was still alive, severely bleeding. Gur'Kahath rapidly ripped off one of his sleeves and used it as a bandage to guards even bigger surprise after seeing one orc turn on another. Then, he rushed to the door...\n\nOutside was a chaos. Screams everywhere, houses burning, people running in terror... Some men tried to put up a fight, but orcs were overpowering them one by one. With no back thought, he went into the fray, shielding people with his own body, slaying his brothers one after another. Orcs were not expecting something like this to happen, and it was all the  advantage he needed...\n\n...when the sun went up, it cleared the village in ruins. Countless people displaced and broken, and when hope once stood was now fear and sorrow. But, they were still alive. Thanks to him. When he was pulling an arrow out of his shoulder, a woman approached him. \n\nHe was expecting for her to hit him or even stab him, but she just thanked him, thanked him for saving life of her little son. He felt something he never felt before. His vision blurred and something warm started running down his cheeks. \n\n \n\nTL;DR: Everyone thought he was bad and didn't trusted him, then he proved that he was good and everyone started to trust him a little.\n\n \n\n5NazO3JYY7c.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c618028/v618028009/104e4/5NazO3JYY7c.jpg]\n\n \n\n \n\nFeel free to bash me for yet another LotR canon ruination and for this pathethic excuse of a backstory :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nEdited August 1, 2014 by MyNeighbourTrololo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112236-canon-mutilation-gurkahath/?do=findComment&comment=1179524","commentId":1179524,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1406906404,"content":"I've also thought about the idea of a \"good\" orc character. It's an interesting concept, and I wonder if Tolkien ever considered it. My reasoning is that he did, but it seems he created orcs as a race that is evil by nature, as opposed to humans, and that they were totally and irremediably corrupt. A fair thing IMO, especially when creating this classic world of good vs evil, but nonetheless an interesting idea. I don't think we'll see an orc hero or ally ever in this game, but there's a good chance we'll see \"evil\" humans turned good. Mybe some sort of Dunlending or Southron renegade hero. That would be amazing IMO."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112236-canon-mutilation-gurkahath/?do=findComment&comment=1179545","commentId":1179545,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1406907053,"content":"Well, I do not understand the part of LotR world, where \"good\" races are rotten with corruption and betrayal, while \"evil\" ones never show a sign of doubt or else.

He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home; and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace.\"\n\n \n\nIn the case of men, I would've been fine if he had just explained better HOW these races succumbed to Sauron, through what means and maybe some history. \n\n \n\nIn the case of Orcs, they were totally and you could even say psychologically enslaved to the will of Sauron. They were not drones, as we can see them infighting. I think they took pleasure in killing and destrying and thus following Sauron yet he was a complete tyrant. It was some sort of an addiction to evil, kinda like the addiction to the Ring possibly. It totally deprives them of their personality, but that's kinda the point. They won't ever doubt, they won't ever stop. Of course this could be considered offensive if it were a different human race. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112236-canon-mutilation-gurkahath/?do=findComment&comment=1179651","commentId":1179651,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1406912129,"content":"`No, I don't know,' said Gorbag's voice. `The messages go through quicker than anything could fly, as a rule. But I don't enquire how it's done. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazgûl give me the creeps. And they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side. But He likes 'em; they're His favourites nowadays, so it's no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving down in the city.'\n\n\n`You should try being up here with Shelob for company,' said Shagrat.\n\n\n'I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em. But the war's on now, and when that's over things may be easier.'\n\n\n`It's going well, they say.'\n\n\n'They would.' grunted Gorbag. `We'll see. But anyway, if it does go well, there should be a lot more room. What d'you say? - if we get a chance, you and me'll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few trusty lads, somewhere where there's good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses.'\n\n\nI think the above is the best look at orc psychology that we ever get. Obviously, they are still interested in loot and not planning on going to have picnics together (raiding is more likely), but still there are signs of doubt there in the sense of not totally buying into Sauron's cause. Most fascinating of all is the line, \"I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em\", which seems to refer to Nazgul, but also Sauron himself. They are clearly pining for the days of freedom before Sauron returned. More than anything, here Tolkien portrays them as typical foot soldiers in a war, disgruntled and hoping the war goes well, not for any deep belief in Sauron, but so that it can end and they can go back to their lives. Again, this doesn't show the orcs as cute and cuddly, by any means, or even good, but they aren't blind minions either.\n\n\nEdited August 1, 2014 by Raven1015"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112236-canon-mutilation-gurkahath/?do=findComment&comment=1179665","commentId":1179665,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1406912625,"content":"**** Ian, I had forgotten that quote!
