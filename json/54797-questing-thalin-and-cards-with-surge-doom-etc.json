Thalin's ability also resolves as they are revealed. Therefore becuase the encounter card has to be revealed in order for Thalin's ability to resolve, The keywords also must resolve because the card has been revealed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54797-questing-thalin-and-cards-with-surge-doom-etc/?do=findComment&comment=542568","commentId":542568,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1318728986,"content":"Seriously, FAQ, page 1:\n\n\"Thalin CORE 6\nWhen an enemy card is revealed from the encounter\ndeck, Thalin’s ability resolves before any keyword or\n“When Revealed” card effects on the encounter card.\"\n\nSadly, there is currently only the Eastern Crows for Thalin to take out, but killing them before they surge can be very nice."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54797-questing-thalin-and-cards-with-surge-doom-etc/?do=findComment&comment=542571","commentId":542571,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1318730210,"content":"Oops! my Bad...

Before the shadow card resolves, Hasty strike is played.\n\n4 Hasty strike resolves, cancelling the shadow effect before it has a chance to resolve.\n\nBecause there is nothing more to the shadow card, nothing else happens. However there are three parts to a card like Eastern Crows, there is the creature, the keyword and the ability. By my logic I am viewing the three parts as separate yet interdependant. All are valid parts of the card, but they don't all just trigger and resolve at the same time. On page 2 of the official FAQ says that Surge, doomed and guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur enters play, including during set up. I take this to mean that they resolve immediately the card is revealed, which implies that they also trigger immediately since they have to trigger in order to resolve. The Forced effect on Eastern crows  triggers when it is defeated. So you see there is a sequence by which these things occur. \n\n \n\n "}]}
