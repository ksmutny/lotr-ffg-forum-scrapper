Let's say it's the combat phase, I am at 1 threat, with Durin's Bane in the staging area and another enemy engaged. I deal to both of them the shadow cards in threat order (since right now Durin's Bane is considered engaged with me) then in the Enemy Attacks step I defend first the engaged enemy with Fastred (since I can choose the order in which enemies attack), sending it back to the staging area and reducing my threat to 0 with Fastred's ability. Will Durin's Bane attack me in that combat phase? I would think not since it should not be able to attack me anymore by its own effect, but it seemed a bit too convenient so I wanted to check.\n\nEdited July 3, 2019 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297075-fastred-and-durins-bane/?do=findComment&comment=3733580","commentId":3733580,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1562153259,"content":"You are correct. As the FAQ (on Light in the Dark) puts it:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> The only step in which the enemy needs to be engaged with the attacked player is step 1 of the Combat phase.\n> \n> [ed.: RR step 6.4b]\n\nLowering your threat to 0 in any way, Fastred included, before hitting 6.4b for Durin's Bane will mean Durin's Bane is no longer considered engaged with you and thus will not attack. It's roughly analogous to playing A Light in the Dark on a regular enemy prior to its associated 6.4bâ€”the fact you dealt it a shadow card is immaterial.\n\nEdited July 3, 2019 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297075-fastred-and-durins-bane/?do=findComment&comment=3733820","commentId":3733820,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1562172043,"content":"This is good to know, I guess I would have defended Durin's Bane in that case."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297075-fastred-and-durins-bane/?do=findComment&comment=3734458","commentId":3734458,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1562245738,"content":"Another way to do this is to use spirit beregond.
