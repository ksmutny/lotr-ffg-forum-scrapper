Disagreement withdrawn.\n\n \n\nTechnically there is some ambiguity here which may allow your original argument to stand.  None Return doesn't specify that it interacts with out-of-play cards and the rules on an enemy being defeated states:\n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> Any time one of these cards has 0 hit points, it is immediately defeated. Defeated characters are placed in their owner’s discard pile, and defeated enemies are placed in the encounter discard pile.\n\n \n\nEven though it says \"immediately defeated\" and later states what you are supposed to do with defeated enemies, it may mean that there is actually a response window in between the enemy being defeated and it actually leaving play to the discard pile.  This would allow both the effect on None Return and Eastern Crows to trigger before it actually left play so I think you could still make your argument as long as you focus on the ambiguity of when exactly a defeated enemy leaves play.\n\n \n\nWith that said, if we say that None Return cannot target out of play enemies (despite Caleb's ruling) but can target a defeated enemy immediately before it is placed in the discard pile, then Eastern Crows' forced effect would necessarily trigger first and cause it to go to an out-of-play state.  Thus, None Return could no longer interact with it. \n\n \n\nNow, I'm not sure if this argument would cause more problems than it solves (I haven't reviewed the impact it may have on other cards), but it seems that in this case it would make more sense.  I do agree with those that find the ruling awkward.  It really causes some issues where you cannot know if you are resolving the play legally or not.\n\n \n\nEdit: Also, the terms \"defeated\" and \"destroyed\" seem to be entirely synonymous but is there actually a difference?  None Return uses destroyed and Eastern Crows uses defeated.  The rulebook alternates between the two it seems.\n\nEdited November 5, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192192-none-returns-crows-core/?do=findComment&comment=1881039","commentId":1881039,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1446757554,"content":"I agree with the last post.

In that case, I return to the conclusion that None Returns doesn't explicitly or implicitly interact with out-of-play cards, and therefore has no ability to target the out-of-play Crows after the Forced effect resolves. So the steps would, to me, be\n\n \n\n1) Crows are defeated\n\n2) Forced effect triggers off the \"enemy leaves play\" prerequisite.
