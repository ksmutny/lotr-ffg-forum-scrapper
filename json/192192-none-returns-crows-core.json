But I guess what is really happening here is a case of the Golden Rule: Only the text following \"When this card is in the victory display\" is active when the card is in the victory display, not the other text. For example, the passive effect on the Empty Mug is not active when it is in the victory display.\n\n \n\nThat being said, GrandSpleen's answer using FAQ 1.09 is much better.
