I like my list too, and I think Scenario specific categories are too narrow and would create confusion about where to make posts that apply to the game in a more broad sense. So, I think we go ahead and make the proposal for the general categories. I'm normally not this \"executive\" in making decisions, but these thoughts come from participating in other forums over time. Also, future change is always an option. This would just be a much improved next step in developing the site as it is currently. My thoughts... if anyone has some remarkably different ideas, please don't hesitate to post. This is all very worth the discussion in my opinion and will be a significant investment in the future quality of these forums.\n\nTo update you post:\n\n1) The next time you post to this thread, immediately afterwards, return to page 1.\n\n2) There will be an Edit option up in the top right hand corner of your original post.\n\n3) Click on the Edit option.\n\n4) Cut and past the URL from the \"edit your post\" page and save that somewhere else (a Word document or whatever). (Then in the future, you just past that specific URL back in your browser when you want to return to the page to make another edit.)\n\n5) Once the page is open for editing, you can update the title of the thread and the content in your original post.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you run into any other questions.

Or maybe are you trying to make a point showing this forum is not moderated. Or maybe you're just an *** ! But, I don't think I desserve this kind of answer...\n\nYes, I would be glad to let people do want they want, where they want and when they want, but then, apply this to you and let me try to be constructive and let me say what I want in a thread where it is relevant...\n\nIf I may add this, I don't read the tournament thread or anything else I don't want to read (when it is clearly indicated in the title of the thread) but I don't want to look through 5 pages before I find anything relevant for me...\n\nSo Yes, I vote FOR the categories, at least, people will write anything they want anywhere they want (in the proper category at least...) and everyone can be happy together. BUT, if it can't be made with FFG, I think we have to self discipline ourselves and be careful with this forum or it will soon be the mess (it is already, no ?)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=594155","commentId":594155,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1329217141,"content":"i think the end point here is no one wants to have their thread buried, and everyone can ignore things that dont interest them, but you cant ignore a page where 75% of the threads arent relevant to you, lets face it -you'll leave the forum eventually, and i dont want this to become a ghost town where everyone's buggered off to cardgamedb or bbg- yes i have seen your signature, and i hate this forum software too, but ive spent a year building up about 1000 posts and several friends on here, so id really prefer it if we tried to better this forum before we give up on it\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=594480","commentId":594480,"userName":"Candacis","timestamp":1329286547,"content":"Ehm, Discussion aside, I'm for categories, too.\n\nI didn't know how to reach a moderator, so I filled out the support contact forum and asked for forum categories."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=594499","commentId":594499,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1329291274,"content":"Candacis said:\n\nEhm, Discussion aside, I'm for categories, too.\n\nI didn't know how to reach a moderator, so I filled out the support contact forum and asked for forum categories.\n\n\n\nthanks updated....................."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=594559","commentId":594559,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1329302463,"content":"Candacis said:\n\n \n\nEhm, Discussion aside, I'm for categories, too.\n\nI didn't know how to reach a moderator, so I filled out the support contact forum and asked for forum categories.\n\n \n\n \n\nCandacis, I think that's a great idea. I'll do the same soon too.\n\nrihsabre, I just want to say, if I haven't made it clear already, I'm really thankful you took the initiative to get this topic going. I agree completely that forum categories will enhance the LOTR LCG forum experience exponentially.\n\nSo, what if we all follow Candacis's lead and start sending in individual messages making this request? (Also, does anyone have any other suggestions for ways to contact FFG directly?) In the request, we could provide a link to this thread too as evidence of the growing support for the change. Of course, it will be more impressive the more \"signatures\" we have, but hopefully, that will continue to grow. In the mean time, some other more direct action may feel good."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=594593","commentId":594593,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1329306488,"content":"i agree,\n\n1. we should sometime soonish show this thread to ffg and point out that we're still gaining signatures\n\n2.try and keep this as alive as possible so any newcomers/returning faces have a chance to put their yay or nay to it"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=594716","commentId":594716,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1329321058,"content":"**self edited**\n\nThere's no need to be rude or abrasive on these forums.  Some people here are starting to sound like that AnnuverScot twit on BGG."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=594732","commentId":594732,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1329323955,"content":"radiskull said:\n\n**self edited**\n\nThere's no need to be rude or abrasive on these forums.  Some people here are starting to sound like that AnnuverScot twit on BGG.\n\n\n\nim confused..what did you say/edit?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=594807","commentId":594807,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1329341087,"content":" I said something not very charitable about the conduct of some members of this thread, which I regretted and then rephrased in a slightly more diplomatic form."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=594860","commentId":594860,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1329357467,"content":"very honourable of you sir happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\nalso to those interested in keeping up with this thread and notifying ffg- i realised admin has been here and left some moderator footprints..so yeah, they must know conspiracy stirs in the depths of the forum lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]"}]}
