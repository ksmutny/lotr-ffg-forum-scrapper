So I see that, each \"Hero\" receives one resource per turn. What happens to the resource if the hero did not spend it and then dies durring that turn? Also after the hero is put into the discard pile, do you still receive resource for that hero even if it is in the discard pile? Why I ask these questions is because 1. it says nothing about it in the rules and 2. what happens if I only run a 1 or 2 hero deck? I am new to the game and am really getting into it. I am finding out that there is not allot of cards out there that help with getting resources and I am trying to build some decks around that problem. Now keep in mind, I just have the core set and I picked up Khazad-dum expansion and two of the packs. So any advice out there would be great thank you for your time.\n\nchris"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85027-resources-and-what-happens-to-them/?do=findComment&comment=803218","commentId":803218,"userName":"nismojoe","timestamp":1371049637,"content":"Decker1613 said:\n\nSo, a couple questions about resources.
