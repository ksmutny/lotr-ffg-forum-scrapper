Could you give us an example?\n\nFor example fighting againts Durin's Bane in Shadow and Flame (never mind that Stage 3 specifically calls out putting it out of play through Dark Pit to be able to win) or in Stage 2 of The Battle of Carn Dum, usually Thaurdir loses Indestructible when you get 15 Quest Points on it, but could you kill it before using this trick?\n\nFor Thaurdir if the problem is the \"cannot leave the staging area\" bit, then how do you win at all? The quest only says it loses Indestructible, so you have to presume that in that case if you pile up enough damage on it it's destroyed (or defeated as the quest says) and than you win, otherwise it's unwinnable. But that's basically the same thing the Revealed in Wrath does, making it lose the keyword.\n\nEdited July 16, 2019 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297558-break-the-unbreakable/?do=findComment&comment=3741060","commentId":3741060,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1563284362,"content":"> Action: Choose a non-unique enemy.
