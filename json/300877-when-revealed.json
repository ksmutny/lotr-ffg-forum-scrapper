This is known in the game as “staging.” These cards are revealed one at a time, with any when revealed abilities being resolved before the next card is revealed.\n\nWe have always played that we go in player order and the card belongs to that person resolving one at a time - now im not sure. Do the when revealed effects affect each player? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300877-when-revealed/?do=findComment&comment=3800977","commentId":3800977,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1570427364,"content":"> 24 minutes ago, kezzzza said:\n> \n> We have always played that we go in player order and the card belongs to that person resolving one at a time - now im not sure.

Perhaps you are thinking of the Saga quests, where the staging step is indeed done with one card for each player (and if that card has the Peril keyword only that player can respond to it)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300877-when-revealed/?do=findComment&comment=3800987","commentId":3800987,"userName":"kezzzza","timestamp":1570429337,"content":"Thank you so much!!!\n\nYes we are playing the Saga - that answers so many questions...\n\nI appreciate your quick response."}]}
