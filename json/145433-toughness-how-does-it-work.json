Does Toughness apply twice? Or is the damage just assigned once as total damage?\n\nMeaning if i have an enemy that has 2 Defence and 1 Toughness and he gets attacked by two characters with 3 Attack.\n\nDoes he now get a total of three damage, or a total of two damage?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145433-toughness-how-does-it-work/?do=findComment&comment=1530155","commentId":1530155,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1428338081,"content":"Damage from an attack is just assigned once, so Toughness only applies once regardless of how many characters you use during the attack.\n\n \n\nIn your example, you attack for a combined strength of 6, and the enemy has 2 defense.  There is 4 damage to be assigned, and the Toughness 1 keyword will lower that to 3."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145433-toughness-how-does-it-work/?do=findComment&comment=1563396","commentId":1563396,"userName":"Nerdmeetsyou","timestamp":1428872666,"content":"Thank you for clearing that up!"}]}
