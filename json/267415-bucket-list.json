What I care most about, however, is being able to play a thematic campaign that recreates the books as faithfully as possible (most of the campaign will be solo, which allows me to avoid allies that wouldn't fit thematically, but some quests are played with two or even three players). To that end, I'm hoping for ally versions of some key characters: Aragorn (for A Knife in the Dark and Flight to the Ford), Merry and Pippin (for The Ring Goes South and Journey in the Dark), and Éomer (for The Urûk-Hai). I'd also like to see a hero version of Grimbold to complete my \"reinforcements\" hero lineup for Helm's Deep.\n\n(Unfinished Tales expands on Grimbold's valour during the battles of the Fords of Isen, and Gandalf sent Grimbold and his men to join Erkenbrand. It's not clear whether Grimbold reached Erkenbrand in time to participate in the dawn attack, but it certainly seems possible; Unfinished Tales says: \"Both on the outward journey [to Isengard], when [Gandalf's] direct route would take him close to the Fords, and on his return south to find Erkenbrand, he must have met Grimbold and Elfhelm,\" so if Grimbold started moving to join Erkenbrand while Gandalf was travelling to Isengard, he might have joined Erkenbrand in time to participate in the battle. It's not entirely thematic to have a reinforcements deck for that quest, but the enemies that they engage can be thought of as the enemies who didn't reach Helm's Deep because of the Rohirrim's valour at the second battle of the fords, and it gives me the opportunity to use Beyond All Hope'd Gandalf.)\n\nIf the designers decide that they don't want to release an ally version of Aragorn or Éomer, I want a high cost non-unique ally that I can use to represent them, and then treat that card as though it were unique (though I wouldn't want to Sword-Thain them and then play hero-only attachments if that seemed exploitable). I'd be happy with Vigilant Dúnadan representing Aragorn if there were an ongoing way to boost his willpower (because of  Power in their Terror and the Witch-king); with Keep Watch, ally Arwen (which stretches theme a bit), and Tale of Tinúviel, Vigilant Dúnadan is perfect for when you reach stage 3 of A Knife in the Dark. There's currently no non-unique Rohan ally that would be a great representation of Éomer, however.\n\nI wanted cards to make a viable Fellowship Frodo/Sam/Galadriel deck with almost no allies. At this point, it can mostly hold its own, with Strider (using the designer-approved house rule that Saga heroes don't count towards the two hero limit), Fireside Song, Rosie, Friend of Friends (Mirror of Galadriel helps to find the second copy relatively quickly), and classic Hobbit attachments. I'm definitely getting closer to having my thematic campaign become a reality."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/267415-bucket-list/?do=findComment&comment=3167887","commentId":3167887,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1515847401,"content":"> 17 hours ago, John Constantine said:\n>  * Saruman hero;\n>  * Saruman ally;\n>  * Saruman attachment;\n>  * Saruman event;\n>  * Saruman side quest.\n\nSaruman tokens"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/267415-bucket-list/?do=findComment&comment=3167888","commentId":3167888,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1515847461,"content":"Also Saruman deluxe expansion, Saruman AP, Saruman Saga, and Saruman PoD.
