I´m asking wether he could be chosen as the recipient for an effect like \"Old Tomnoddy\"´s Forced: At the end of each round, each player must give a hero he controls 1 poison\", and simply just avoid it by being immune to it.\n\nI´m personally leaning towards the notion that an unconcious character cannot be chosen because it´s not an eligible target. I can´t seem to find a ruling to support this atm. Maybe such a ruling is there and I have overlooked it but a reference to where I´d be able to find that rule would be appreciated."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81322-venom-during-combat-question/?do=findComment&comment=781480","commentId":781480,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1365110114,"content":"Nerdmeister said:\n\nI´m personally leaning towards the notion that an unconcious character cannot be chosen because it´s not an eligible target. \n\n\n\nI agree with this.  Kind of like Beorn in Watcher in the Water: if Beorn and one other character attacks Grasping Tentacle and it ends up as an attachment, it has to go onto the other character because Beorn is ineligible.  \n\nI guess it's covered by this:\n\n \n\n\"(1.03) Conflicting Effect Targeting\nIf an encounter or quest effect attempts to target a\nsingle player or card, and there are multiple eligible\ntargets, the first player selects the target of the effect\nfrom among the eligible options.\" (official FAQ, p. 3)\n \nAll of your unpoisoned guys are eligible; unconscious ones aren't."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81322-venom-during-combat-question/?do=findComment&comment=782649","commentId":782649,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1365404095,"content":"GrandSpleen said:\n\n \n\nI agree with this.  Kind of like Beorn in Watcher in the Water: if Beorn and one other character attacks Grasping Tentacle and it ends up as an attachment, it has to go onto the other character because Beorn is ineligible.  \n\nI guess it's covered by this:\n\n \n\n\"(1.03) Conflicting Effect Targeting\nIf an encounter or quest effect attempts to target a\nsingle player or card, and there are multiple eligible\ntargets, the first player selects the target of the effect\nfrom among the eligible options.\" (official FAQ, p. 3)\n \nAll of your unpoisoned guys are eligible; unconscious ones aren't.\n\n \n\n \n\nWhile I agree with your conclusion, I still see a flaw in the FAQ quote: it does not define what an eligible target is, just how to choose from among those targets.

For example, the hero Beorn cannot be chosen as a target for a treachery effect with the text \"attach to a hero\" because he has the text \"cannot have attachments.\" That treachery must be attached to a different hero instead.\nIn the case of unconscious characters and poison: each quest stage in that scenario explains that unconscious characters cannot be poisoned, so each unconscious character is an ineligible target for poison.\nRegards,\nCaleb\n\nSo pretty much what I suspected. Nice to have it confirmed."}]}
