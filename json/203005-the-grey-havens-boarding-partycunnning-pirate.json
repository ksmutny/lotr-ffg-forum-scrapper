This weekend some other players and I are going to give the first scenario a try. I'm doing a few solo test runs to smooth out rules and get used to things.\n\nAlright, so my first question that has come up involves the Treachery card \"Boarding Party\" and the Enemy card \"Cunning Pirate.\"\n\nDuring the questing phase I reveal the Boarding Party which says \"When Revealed: Each player reveals the top card of the Corsair deck and puts it into play, engaged with him.\" So since I'm playing solo I reveal one card from the Corsair deck and it turns out to be a Cunning Pirate. Now, Cunninh Pirate reads \"Forced: When Cunning Pirate engages you, discard an attachment you control and place resources on Cunninh Pirate equal to that attachment's printed cost.\"\n\nI'm wondering if the wording on Boarding Party \"...puts it into play, engaged...\" would trigger the Forced reaction on Cunning Pirate \"When Cunning Pirate engages you.\"? It's the phrasing that makes me think it wouldn't trigger because Cunning Pirate comes into play already engaged, no engaging actually occurs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203005-the-grey-havens-boarding-partycunnning-pirate/?do=findComment&comment=2059839","commentId":2059839,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1455826550,"content":"Pretty sure the use of the word \"engaged\" in Boarding Party indicates the trigger \"engagement\" so Cunning Pirate triggers his Forced Reaction."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203005-the-grey-havens-boarding-partycunnning-pirate/?do=findComment&comment=2060019","commentId":2060019,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1455831390,"content":"Yeah, when a card enters play engaged with a player, it is still considered to have \"engaged\" that player.  This Forced effect will trigger."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203005-the-grey-havens-boarding-partycunnning-pirate/?do=findComment&comment=2060071","commentId":2060071,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1455832845,"content":"The simple rule that I don't believe has any exceptions is \"when a card moves from the state 'not engaged with Player X' to the state 'engaged with Player X' it has engaged Player X and Player X has engaged it\".\n\nEdited February 18, 2016 by NathanH"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203005-the-grey-havens-boarding-partycunnning-pirate/?do=findComment&comment=2060633","commentId":2060633,"userName":"BrettP","timestamp":1455863053,"content":"Thanks for the input everyone!\n\nI know a lot of these card games are very specific on the wording so maybe I looked a little too deeply at it. I played it the way you all suggested anyway because if I've learned anything about this game over the years it's this:\n\n\"If I'm in doubt, it's probably the option that punishes you the most\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203005-the-grey-havens-boarding-partycunnning-pirate/?do=findComment&comment=2063359","commentId":2063359,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1456003355,"content":"> The simple rule that I don't believe has any exceptions is \"when a card moves from the state 'not engaged with Player X' to the state 'engaged with Player X' it has engaged Player X and Player X has engaged it\".\n\n \n\nWe wondered today whether Land of Shadow Gollum counts as having engaged you after he flips from Smeagol to Gollum.
