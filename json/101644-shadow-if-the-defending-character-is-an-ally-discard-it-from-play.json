During the combat phase, I declare a character with 1 hit point (printed cost on card) as a defender against an enemy with the Venom trait. A shadow card is dealt to the attacking enemy that has the shadow effect that deals 1 poison to the defending character, which makes the character unconscious. Is the attack now undefended because unconscious characters can not defend, or is the attack still considered defended because the defender has already been declared (step 2 of 'Resolving Enemy Attack' on p. 18 of the rules)?\n\nA: I'm afraid that if your defender becomes unconscious before the attack resolves, then the attack is considered undefended.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101644-shadow-if-the-defending-character-is-an-ally-discard-it-from-play/?do=findComment&comment=1017844","commentId":1017844,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1395212436,"content":"Page 18 of the Core Rule Book:\n\n \n\n\"If a defending character leaves\n\nplay or is removed from combat before damage is\nassigned, the attack is considered undefended\"\n \nSometimes the answer is closer than you think  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\nEdited March 19, 2014 by Nerdmeister"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101644-shadow-if-the-defending-character-is-an-ally-discard-it-from-play/?do=findComment&comment=1018320","commentId":1018320,"userName":"FreddieG","timestamp":1395242637,"content":"I don't like the idea that even though you declare a defender it would become undefended - especially if that means attack bonuses.
