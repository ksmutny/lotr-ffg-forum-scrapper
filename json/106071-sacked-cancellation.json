The 'When Revealed' text on \"Sacked!\" states that it cannot be canceled.\n\nA: Good question. You can cancel the shadow text on Sacked! since it is only the \"When Revealed\" effect that cannot be canceled. If you cancel the shadow effect, then you never have to resolve the \"when revealed\" effect, including the \"cannot be canceled\" portion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106071-sacked-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=1082886","commentId":1082886,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1399977308,"content":"Thank you for a precise answer and relevant reference jjeagle"}]}
