This seems more graceful than dealing three shadow cards for the enemy and resolving them as you go around. Would love to know the technically correct answer though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307290-enemies-that-are-engaged-to-all-players-and-shadow-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3921324","commentId":3921324,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1585504279,"content":"[2019 ruling]\n\nEdited March 29 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307290-enemies-that-are-engaged-to-all-players-and-shadow-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3921352","commentId":3921352,"userName":"Valhalla Gaming","timestamp":1585510830,"content":"Ah so looks like this was played correctly, unless I do not deal the initial shadow card to the first player?  Not that it would usually even be relevant but there are situations it could be."}]}
