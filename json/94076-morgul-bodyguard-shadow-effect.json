Enemy that began attacking to one player, he continues the attack, from your playing area, from other playing area's player, or from staging area ('Light in the dark', for example, not avoid the enemy's attack if it began).\n\nAnd the question about shadows is in faq1.5. Each attack is diferent, and shadows not join themselves. So you discard first shadow cards after enemy starts new attack. Effects of first shadow card are disabled."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94076-morgul-bodyguard-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=916834","commentId":916834,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1385463529,"content":"I'm not convinced...

If there is no other player for the enemy to attack, then it is not able. In that case, the shadow effect is ignored and the attack resolves as normal. If there was another player, this shadow effect would end the current attack and immediately begin a new attack. Since you reveal shadow cards one at a time, if there are unrevealed shadow cards on the attacking enemy when this effect triggers, they would be discarded when this enemy makes a new attack and is dealt a new shadow card.\n\nHope you're enjoying the scenario!\n\nCheers,\n\nCaleb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94076-morgul-bodyguard-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=918253","commentId":918253,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1385595694,"content":"Ends the current attack -- so does that mean the current attack ends unresolved?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94076-morgul-bodyguard-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=918605","commentId":918605,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1385643008,"content":"seems like it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94076-morgul-bodyguard-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=1023267","commentId":1023267,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1395579851,"content":"I've always played that both attacks still resolve rather than the first being cancelled/unresolved..!

FAQ 1.7 (1.32) Mid-Attack Control or Engagement Change says that if enemy engages another player during the resolution of an attack, that attack still resolves.\n\nI thought that the shadow card is dealt to enemy only at the beginning of combat phase. Unless the shadow effect says otherwise."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94076-morgul-bodyguard-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=1506480","commentId":1506480,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1427317957,"content":"On the next page of that FAQ we've got this:\n\n \n\n(1.42) Additional attacks by an enemy\nWhen an enemy makes an additional attack, discard all\nof its previously dealt shadow cards before dealing it a\nnew shadow card.\n \nSo the enemy should get a shadow card.  But the whole 'end the current attack' thing is a big question mark for me.  I don't see why it should end the attack unresolved."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94076-morgul-bodyguard-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=1506565","commentId":1506565,"userName":"Laco","timestamp":1427321508,"content":"Ah, that I overlooked.
