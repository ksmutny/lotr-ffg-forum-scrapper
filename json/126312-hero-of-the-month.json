Trying out something that will hopefully prove insightful/interesting over at my blog, The Secondhand Took. Each month I'm going to showcase a different hero, go over some discussion topics about the hero and mostly showcase some deck lists I either found on the internet or came up with myself.\n\n \n\nAs always I'd love to hear any feedback! The link is below.\n\n \n\nHope you all had a fun Halloween!\n\n \n\nhttp://secondhandtook.wordpress.com/2014/11/03/hero-of-the-month-samwise-gamgee/ [http://secondhandtook.wordpress.com/2014/11/03/hero-of-the-month-samwise-gamgee/]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126312-hero-of-the-month/?do=findComment&comment=1321757","commentId":1321757,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1415096300,"content":"Ouh, nice blog.
