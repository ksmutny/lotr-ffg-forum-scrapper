(The encounter deck draws 1 card per player which is how the game scales).\n\nYou can choose to run 6 heroes and two decks if you want it to be closer to the 2 player game. In this case you keep the decks separate, they have separate hands and resources.\n\n\nYou pay the cost to put the card in play - exhausting doesn't cost extra unless the card says so, you just tilt the card to show it's used."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105375-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=1071063","commentId":1071063,"userName":"Bolieride","timestamp":1399123858,"content":"I knew I was probably over-thinking it!  Thanks!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105375-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=1071096","commentId":1071096,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1399128147,"content":"I wonder how are you still thinking you need to pay the resources to exhaust something after reading rulebook and watching tutorial..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105375-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=1071251","commentId":1071251,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1399142211,"content":"The purpose of this thread was to answer a question.
