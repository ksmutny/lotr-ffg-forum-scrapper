As an action it made no sense, given previous rulings on cancellation of shadow effects via shadow card discard did not work in many cases.\n\n \n\nSo will this become an official errata?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232693-deorwine-timing/?do=findComment&comment=2464856","commentId":2464856,"userName":"Crabble","timestamp":1476876386,"content":"Probably ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"}]}
