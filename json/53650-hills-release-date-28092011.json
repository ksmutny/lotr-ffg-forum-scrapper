There are people that struggle with Mirkwood. They need easier quests. And even the most skilled and experienced players can lose against a difficulty 4 quest, just draw the money grabing treachery during the set up of the Hunt and it will be tough to take it from there. So, I think it is perfectly reasonable that there are also \"easier\" quests. Although I think the levels are redundant. They should not mention them at all 'cause it really depends on many factors.\n\nAs for the new cards, can someone spill a bit more beans? What is Brand's trait? A Barding?\n\nAsertus, your translation is perfectly fine, can you tell us about the response of Brand? And some more details of the cards you mentioned? If you find time and interest, of course.
