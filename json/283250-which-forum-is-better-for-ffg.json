I think a lot of new players come here for help and haven't heard of BBG, so there's that, too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283250-which-forum-is-better-for-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=3480177","commentId":3480177,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1537645089,"content":"I see, so although the BGG forum might be better for attracting new players, this one might be better for retaining them? \n\n('cause after all, it's probably the expansions that earn the most money for FFG)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283250-which-forum-is-better-for-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=3480231","commentId":3480231,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1537649865,"content":"I wouldn't say BGG attracts new players better, unless you mean that other gamers hear about LotR there and try it out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283250-which-forum-is-better-for-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=3480312","commentId":3480312,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1537655813,"content":"BGG is how I hear about 90% of the games I buy!  The \"hot\" forum lists are often a great way to attract my attention.  I'm sure there are others who feel the same way."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283250-which-forum-is-better-for-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=3480320","commentId":3480320,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1537656664,"content":"That's true for me, too.
