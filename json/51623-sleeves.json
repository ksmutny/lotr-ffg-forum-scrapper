Is it just me or do these seem slightly oversized?  There is plenty of room around the card, and the top sticks out about 1/4 inch past the card.  Dont get me wrong, the sleeves are amazing.  They look tough as nails.\n\nI've used Ultra Pro in the past, and the fit is snugger, but I've had them split sometimes. \n\nWhat do you all use?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51623-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=515083","commentId":515083,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1313458920,"content":"I'm using FFG's sleeves.

Sleeving my cards at the rate they have them available means the game will be discontinued before I'm done :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nI also can't find many FFG sleeves at CCG Armory, which is the preferable place now (best shipping costs, reasonable speed). I prefer having a lot of coloured sleeves, rather than art sleeves, but it seems I'll have to resort to those. Ultra Pro sleeves are both too tall and too wide - FFG sleeves are a little narrower. At least the coloured ones I've bought so far.\n\nI'd love to know a good type of sleeve to get for the scenario cards also! Something as durable as the art sleeves, but transparent. I have about 2000 generic Ultra Pro sleeves I use while looking for proper ones, and they feel like socks where the rubber band tore :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51623-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=515336","commentId":515336,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1313495678,"content":" \n\nI use MayDay games sleeves (Maydaygames.com) - which you can get in the UK via boardgameextras.co.uk\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51623-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=515507","commentId":515507,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1313516348,"content":"Still using the penny / cheap sleeves, but I'll probably switch to the official LotR ones if they can start selling them.\n\nI did buy one set of FFG Standard (transparent) sleeves and use them on the quest cards since opaque sleeves won't do on those.

Especially if you use the designer sleeve FFG is putting out soon... and changing them out would get annoying."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51623-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=515645","commentId":515645,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1313538014,"content":" I have all of my LOTR cards in sleeves, but then again I'm also a person that bought three Core Sets.\n\nBack when I played Magic as a teen, I only sleeved the cards I actually played with in my decks, but that may have had more to do with overwhelming numbers of cards and huge numbers of duplicates, etc, which so far definitely isn't a problem with this game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51623-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=515723","commentId":515723,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1313555759,"content":"pumpkin said:\n\n \n\nI use MayDay games sleeves (Maydaygames.com) - which you can get in the UK via boardgameextras.co.uk\n\n \n\n \n\nBookmarked!\n\nI sleeve all my decks, at the very least. For all the LCGs I have prepared decks, and for this game there are even more cards in constant use. I'd use the art sleeves when they arrive, because even though they are pricier than some regular sleeves, I still pay 50% more for regular sleeves from my local gaming store than at CCG Armory or Sci-fi Genre. Board Game Extras seem to follow American prices too. Shipping is even friendlier from the UK if they deliver here.\n\nI always toss in some sleeves when ordering cards and games from those places, making the cost insignificant. Let's not talk about my 2000+ sleeve collection of Ultra Pros, though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI've got corrugated BCW boxes (the ones that fit 800 cards) for my older LCGs. All the unused (at this moment!) cards go there, without sleeves. When I build decks I pick the cards I need, put sleeves on them and stick them in plastic Ultra Pro deckboxes. Usually colour-coded, depending on availability at the ULGS."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51623-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=516289","commentId":516289,"userName":"Slipstream","timestamp":1313628570,"content":"evilidler said:\n\npumpkin said:\n\nI build decks I pick the cards I need, put sleeves on them and stick them in plastic Ultra Pro deckboxes.

Since I've got so many clear sleeves, which yes I sleeve all of them, it would suck to have to unsleeve each one. My set is used by my friends when they come over for game night too."}]}
