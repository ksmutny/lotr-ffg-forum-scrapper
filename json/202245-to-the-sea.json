So first you have to exhaust character + Narya, what allows you to choose up to 2 allies. At this point you are allowed to choose and ally Gandalf is exhausted, so he should be a valid target .\n\n \n\nThe card reads: \"exhaust to choose\", so you can't choose if you didn't exhaust Gandalf (in this case), and when you are allowed to choose nothing says you can't target the (completly exhausted) character, you used to pay the cost.\n\n \n\nNo garantee this is right, but it's how I understand the card and would play it.\n\n \n\nOnly Problem could be, if exhausting and choosing should happen at the same time (but from the card text it doesn't sound like this would be the case)\n\nEdited February 11, 2016 by Calvadur"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202245-to-the-sea/?do=findComment&comment=2047536","commentId":2047536,"userName":"Davachido","timestamp":1455230634,"content":"Still not out in UK, bah, more F5s on online game stores... not enough F5s to get it here faster!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202245-to-the-sea/?do=findComment&comment=2047744","commentId":2047744,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1455241195,"content":"> Can ally Gandalf target himself with Narya, exhaust for the cost and then ready for the effect?\n\n \n\nDon't see why not.

The decks they posted in articles before Lost Realm was released definitely did use some other expansions (heroes included Frodo and Sam, don't remember about other deck content), but I think they try to put up decklists using not too many different expansions so it's more likely people can actually put them together with a limited card pool.

You would gain a leadership resource (the cheapest resources) each turn. And he would still commit to the quest for 4 each round.

I'm curious if it's an official and measured decision or if it's just a product of who the designers and marketing people are assigned to each game.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nI think it is definitely 100% worse.... if you didn't want to look at spoilers you could just not... for those who do want spoilers and tidbits and what not there is next to nothing and at an extremely slow rate too.... sometimes large stretches of time will pass with no spoilers and this definitely doesn't help the forums stay active either.\n\nI get that if they release too many spoilers too early it kills the actual excitement and build up when the pack is released.\n\nThe thing is though about a week before the pack is officially released a few random people have it already from a single store that somehow had it before anyone else or before FFG OR it came out in Spain or another random country like a week earlier. We then get all the spoilers like a week out (player cards at least) from it being available across the US. I live in Australia so I usually see every single card including encounter cards before I get my hands on the actual product anyway..... I think quite a few people are in the same or similar situations (almost everyone out side of the US really) and so we have everything spoiled or at least available to view online far before we get our hands on the cards anyway..... so why not spoil things a little further out? \n\nIf they had the same international release date for products (like MtG) then this wouldn't be an issue but they do not have anything like this and release dates are different in every country. \n\n \n\nAlso lots of people use proxies, the more spoilers we get the more future player cards we can proxy to try out new mechanics and concepts in advance (legal official cards mind you, just ones not yet released) which keeps people interested and excited for the new packs and mechanics. \n\nIt would generate far more discussion on the forums and they would be far more active if there was a steady release of spoilers leading up to a release and I also think that many cards that are a bit more situational or weak would get more attention than they normally would. Lets say a single card is spoiled, many people may want to try it out and discuss it simply because it is new and shiny and exciting. If that card is spoiled at the same time as others and is lacklustre or nowhere near as exciting or broadly useful as the other cards there is going to be very little discussion about it. If spoiled on its own far more people will discuss and potentially even try out that card. Imagine if we had some sort of Card of the Week thing where a single player card from the current/upcoming cycle is spoiled to generate discussion and to allow us to try these new cards out in anticipation. \n\nI think this would work very well and they could spoil the hero last, the week before release. I think this would actually add to excitement rather than take away from it because it would be like oh my god did you see how amazing Thranduil is? I cannot WAIT to get the pack next week to play with him or alternatively those who proxy cards would get to use him right before release if they really wanted to but still have the excitement of the actual new quest itself to look forward to as well as using the real cards (don't know about you guys but getting to remove proxies and put in the real cards is an awesome feeling!) \n\nThis is just my opinion however and I totally get where people opposed to this would be coming from as it is key to keep certain things a surprise to actually promote and sell the product in the first place. That being said however you totally can just ignore spoilers and the whole stupid defense of; I don't want spoilers but if there are any I can't help but look at them so there shouldn't be any, is just insanely ridiculous and selfish. If you don't want to look at them don't, if you do look but claim you didn't want to don't try to blame that on something/someone else you just couldn't help yourself/have bad self control. \n\nI don't think anything will change though, I think that they have a very unique situation and set up with this game (especially because its co-op and the whole concept of encounter cards) and prefer to keep it a little more secretive and provide less spoilers in advance. They have to find a balance between encounter cards and player cards to show us in articles as well and often will show us ONLY encounter cards in an article to stop us from knowing anything about the player cards in the pack...\n\nDue to there being more spoilers for most other FFG games I would assume it has to do with the individuals who design and market this game. At the end of the day they can do what they want, its the best goddamn card game ever set in the greatest fictional world ever  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]  It would be nice to get more spoilers but whatever!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202245-to-the-sea/?do=findComment&comment=2093735","commentId":2093735,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1457577129,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > FFG sends spoilers to Thrones podcasts.
