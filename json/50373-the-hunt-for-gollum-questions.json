(i.e., the next round or later)\n\n#2) Quest card 1B reads something like (paraphrased): \"Forced: Whenever the players quest successfully, the first player must draw 3 cards, and select 1 of them to put in the staging area.  Discard the other 2 cards.\" If you are currently on quest card 1B and successfully quest, adding enough progress tokens to complete the current quest card to move to quest card 2A, do you trigger the Forced effect on 1B?\n\nSome other players' thoughts would be very appreciated."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50373-the-hunt-for-gollum-questions/?do=findComment&comment=503422","commentId":503422,"userName":"wlk","timestamp":1311463273,"content":" Same questions here: javascript:void(0);/*1311481688734*/ [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=523213]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50373-the-hunt-for-gollum-questions/?do=findComment&comment=503480","commentId":503480,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1311480261,"content":"I've played it that when you complete the location signs of Golum goes into the staging area to be picked up the next time you quest successfully.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50373-the-hunt-for-gollum-questions/?do=findComment&comment=503490","commentId":503490,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1311485590,"content":"spirit said:\n\nI've played it that when you complete the location signs of Golum goes into the staging area to be picked up the next time you quest successfully.  \n\n\n\nI also play like this. there is the force effect.

For the Hunter from Mordor it doesnt matter if the clue cards are in the staging area (unclaimed or still guarded) or claimed by any hero or even guarded by the active location. When a hunter comes into play while there are no clue cards it is a good idea to engage him and kill him off before he gets stronger when the first clue card comes into play. He doesnt become weaker, only stronger as time passes..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50373-the-hunt-for-gollum-questions/?do=findComment&comment=505131","commentId":505131,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1311779974,"content":"From the rulebook (p. 25):\n\n\"In play\" refers to cards that have been played or put into play (in a player's play area), to cards that are waiting in the staging area, to the currently revealed quest card, and to encounter cards that are engaged with that player.\n\nSo, I would say that the shadow card is not \"in play\" and thus a shadow card clue won't boost the Hunter.\n\nHowever, having reread that definition, I find it weird that the active location is not specifically mentionned as being \"in play\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50373-the-hunt-for-gollum-questions/?do=findComment&comment=505138","commentId":505138,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1311781571,"content":"oops, right, I obviously misread the question. Of course clue cards revealed as shadow cards are not treated as \"clue\" cards bc only the effect below the line (if any) is used and the rest of the card is void.
