I think if you didn't buy in and just played as a free-to-play player it may have not felt very F2P at all. At least now people are making fewer purchases for more content."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3508142","commentId":3508142,"userName":"Hannibal_pjv","timestamp":1539895950,"content":"I like these changes. The Pathfinder adventures cards game did run to serious economical problems because people were playing it without paying a dim... And the development of the game ended too early because it was not sensible to make new content to it (without getting development money back). They did try to change the economy mode later, but it was too late for that.\n\nNow FFG at least know that they have steady income with each expansion. (If the game is popular enough) Also many country seeks and destroys games that has loot box systems... So putting on the market new game with that system would just lead to attacks by government official and lawyers. So more likely than not they would have had to change the economy mode in anyway sooner or later. So it is better to do before the real release.\n\nIn competitive environment you have to spent money, so that you don't lose to players that have all the new cards and you don't. In coop, you can easily play without ever using any money, because it does not matter if other players have better cards. You will get them sooner or later. Sometimes many year later. In competitive card game it would have been real pain, to loose all the time to opponents that does have those new cards, so there is a pressing reason to sink money to the game. And the game does not live a long if it does not make profits to the developers. You have to play salaries, earn something to the share holders and so on. Now there is change to that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3508205","commentId":3508205,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1539900213,"content":"Can't see the game lasting.

It's \"out\" in every meaningful sense.\n\nImo this is the fatal flaw in the understanding of AE. If everyone is allowed access for a (smaller or larger) fee it feels like a full release. No matter how many info boxes might pop up. And if the game doesn't live up to the expectations, improves or doesn't even have a good communication between fans and developers it is doomed (most likely).\n\nBut that's not the intention of AE. Developers want feed back (and finical security), because some stuff is best checked by many people. Stuff like the monetisation. For me their initial plan sounded perfectly fine (even though I wasn't happy with some details) and I am sure they were happy with their idea, too. However it seems it didn't work out so it had to change. More or less exactly what you want from AE. This isn't \"Oh no they didn't even had that figuered out, game is dead\", it's \"hey they noticed something they/the community aren't happy with and try to change it for the better\". The game is IN development right now. Not just for content. Technical issues and yes even fundamental design decisions are tested and subject to change. \nHow should the monetisation have been tested \"in alpha\" or \"private beta\". Most likely the shop wasn't even working at this point. No way you could have tested if thousands of people would invest enough money with the planned system, so you needed a public test. With real people, having the option to spend their money.\n\nThis got a little longer than expected and maybe reads like a rage, but for all the disappointments that happend with AE, I hate to read that decisions like this one are a bad thing during AE, shouldn't happen or that AE is a meaningful release (a I said: for me the greatest misconception the gaming-community can't get rid of) as FFG, in my oppinion, are doing a great job with the AE (giving weekly updates, streaming, patching). This is independant from the success of the game. The core idea is set and they try to optimise it. If the game fails (low sales, no players etc.) so be it. Many \"great games\" never were a success or even got studios closed. So just because your game may fail, doesn't mean the development process failed too. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3508706","commentId":3508706,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1539962238,"content":"> 1 hour ago, TheWiseGuy said:\n> \n> I'm just saying it would be worse if it was full release and they were making big changes.\n\nHaha, that would be a nightmare.

Scenario rules can change the game so that it is almost different game than the normal. It is good with Humans... it is bad with computers.\n\nthe Pathfinder Adventures is the best example how the scenario based card game is almost carbon copy of the real tabletop game... and ques what. It is full of bugs. The basic idea is tha you find the Villain and corner it and kill down. Those scenarios works really well! But special scenarios where there is something different Are buggy like a ****. For example scenario where you try to save people from the Flood and moster... was a long time very buggy. Or scenarios where there only is one location... that scenario is still very buggy. Because the scenario powers change the game so much that normal game engine does not behave nicely any more. You have to completely rewrite those scenarios. It is like makin whole new game just for some scenario rules... that takes time, and resources and money.\n\nit is no wonder that The digital game is almost completely different than the tabletop version. It is easier, it is more cost effective and it definitely is easier to squash bugs from that code. Simple games like Magic and other games that use same rules in every game Are simpler to make. So Android Netrunner could be possible to make carbon copy or L5R but games like Arkham horror Lcg will definitely be allmost completely different in digital format than tabletop version, unless the company is really crasy and wants to burn money... pity but true.\n\ni think that the digital Pathfinder adventures is a better game than LOTR, but it has a cost of making it uneconomical to the company.\n\nso this game is totally different than the real one, but it is still quite good card game! And it is different because of very good reasons...\n\nEdited October 28, 2018 by Hannibal_pjv\nAdditional content"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3516684","commentId":3516684,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1540674737,"content":"I guess you could probably make something that follows the same rules as the physical game but has different cards and quests, so you don't have to struggle with implementing horrible things just because they were in the original game.

In the digital game, there are actually more decisions to make than in the tabletop game. I do see your view expressed frequently though, so I'll expand on what I mean:\n\nIn the digital game, Sauron gets a chance to act after every card you play or action you make. This means in addition to deciding *what* to do, there's a whole parallel set of decisions you need to make, namely the priority of your actions. And this will shift over the course of a round as new information becomes available.\n\nImagine the planning phase of the tabletop game where it mattered what order you played your allies and attachments. Imagine the quest phase where the order in which you commit your characters to the quest mattered. Imagine that the order you defended and killed enemies mattered all the time, not just every once and a while. It adds an incredible number of decisions to the game.\n\nSome math:\n\nLet's assume I have 6 characters on the table. Each round, a character will quest, attack, or defend, and you get to decide what they do.\n\nIn the tabletop game, the order you perform these actions either normally doesn't matter, or is determined for you (questing always comes before combat, defending always before attacking, etc.). This means that there are 6 characters * 3 actions = 18 possible ways this turn could go. So I'm essentially deciding on one path out of 18.\n\nIn the digital game, action order is critical. I have to decide which of the 6 characters I use first, then which of the remaining 5 I use second, etc. In total there are actually 6!*3 ways the game could go, where 6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1. So when I play a turn of the digital game I'm deciding on one path among over 2,000.\n\nGranted, the board state in the tabletop game tends to have more characters on it, but the way the decision points scale in each game, you only need a small number of digital characters to dwarf the decision points of a huge tabletop game.\n\nThe problem is that people see the phase structure of the tabletop game as more complex than the digital game (it is) and therefore conclude that there must be more decision points. But this is in fact the opposite of what happens. By limiting certain actions in the tabletop game to certain phases, you actually end up with fewer player decisions, not more."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3518837","commentId":3518837,"userName":"Buhallin","timestamp":1540882695,"content":"> 5 hours ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> In the tabletop game, the order you perform these actions either normally doesn't matter, or is determined for you (questing always comes before combat, defending always before attacking, etc.).

Disappointing as the actual game part has a lot of potential.\n\nWell, sure compared to the actual card game the content is closes to non existent. But you have to start out somewhere. We started the physical game with a box of 3 quests. One ment to be played as a tutorial, one with great replayability and one to hard for many people to enjoy. With the player cards given to you, there weren't many \"viable\" decks, and in true solo even less. Was that content worth 40$?\n\nThe digital game is at the same point. There are few player cards and even fewer quests. But everyone should be able to complete them (as there are 3 difficulties). And we have more to come. Getting a ton of in game currency means you won't have to worry about getting new valour cards any time soon. And the more heroes and quests release, the easier it will be to farm up the valour points (for doing decent with a hero in a quest).\n\nSo yeah. There isn't too much content at the moment, but it's the same with any new game that is based on an ever growing cardpool and you can get in for iirc 8$ and get the first five quests (+the new \"encounter\", a \"ultra-hard\" quest, think like a POD quest) and player cards prior to the recent update. What is (imo) a really good deal, netting an absolute minimum of 3 hours of gameplay (for playing the quests once and listing to the story with it's complete voiceover). Than you can obviously improve your score or increase difficulty. Worth it in my opinion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3545651","commentId":3545651,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1543067618,"content":"You shouldn't be comparing it to the tabletop game, there is no point, it doesn't competes with the tabletop version.

It is mandatory for playing the rest of the game. But there is only one interesting scenario when you buy the game, almost no deckbuilding possible. I think LOTR get lucky to offer a cooperative version in a time where the cooperative offer was small (it is not longer true), and it get it first expansion release quite quickly as far I remember (I start the game with the first AP, so I was quite early but not enough for this point ^^) so this was also quickly forgiven by dedicated players.

Does this, in any way, compete with the gameplay of the LotR LCG? No.\n\nWhat about the solo content of Hearthstone? Appart from the recent Dr. Boom riddles, they always give you AI-Opponents with stronger cards/heropowers to combat the horiffic AI and create a challenge. Partially you can create a deck to beat them, partially you have an \"on the go\" deck building. Could this appeal to someone interested in the LCG?  Quite possible.\n\nI thinks it is totally fine to ignore the PvP aspects of other games as the LCG never was meant to directly be played against other people (we got this mode with the fellowship event, but come on that isn't PvP).\nSo if we compare to HS we just have to worry about the PvE part. And at the moment there is much more in HS. Though you have to grind or pay quite some money to get the adventures (Meaning you coud also get the mithril pack for the LCG). And then you are still stuck with mostly basic cards and have to play a game mode you didn't care about in the first place to grind cards or pay even more to get them quick.\nAfter some tinkering you finsihed the adventure (in hard mode) and then? Do many people come back to replay them? I don't. The content is more of a riddle to solve and once that's done you are done. HS asks the question, if you can come up ith a deck for a specific task, and while you are free to do that in the LCG, many people like to come up with a deck that can beat as many quests as possible. Or is as thematic as possible. Hearthstone doesn't offer anything in this regard at all. The modes with \"random\" deck aren't what a LotR LCG player looks for, as \"complex\" dedicated deck building as a core aspect of the game.\nSumming up: Hearthstone might have more \"pure content\" at the moment. But it puts PVP first. If you enjoy that part of the game, you will have a nice collection to get the most fun of the PvE. If you don't you have a huge paywall for this content or have to grind a mode you don't like.\n\nIntro: The Lotr LCG. Quite small at the moment there will be at least 16 quests upon full release (I'd argue 1 quests in normal mode easily offers as much content as 3 bosses in a HS adventure in normal mode). All with multiple phases and their own story (something HS only as the absolute minimum of to have a setting for the SP content). You are encouraged to beat the quests in as many ways as possible and as good as possible. New cards you also get either for money or with ingame currency, which you get for playing a game mode you actually want to play.\n\nTo bring this to an end: The LCG and Hearthstone can easily co-exist like the hawk and raven. Even though both are birds one doesn't push awy the other. Same goes for the card games. The LCG wants to cater to other players than HS. Sure there are players interested in both and as HS exists much longer they might stay there/don't participate in the AE because of a lack of content (and I repeat the content you get for just picking up the shire pack is great). But once the game has a full release with triple the content they might reconsider it.\n\nOne last thing: IF you should have to compare the LCG to HS, you would have had to compare the physical LCG to Magic: The Gathering. And magic outclassed LotR by a huge margin and many other card games did too. Even I house products did. But it became a hit, despite inital lack of content.\n\n \n\nTL;DR: The LCG caters to other player than other popular digital card games, putting PvE over PvP, therefore trying to find it's own niche. The inital \"lack of content\" is impossible to prevent as other games are much longer on the market, but will (obviously) go away with time and can't really be an argument against the game. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3545796","commentId":3545796,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1543082226,"content":"> 19 hours ago, Edheliad said:\n> \n> There's nowhere near enough content to justify spending money on it, and very little suggestion that will change.

It's not fine to ignore their existance. Why tabletop LotR succeeded? It offered a possibility to play a card game alone, without the need for a human opponent. Digital card games eradicated the requirement of a physical human opponent due to internet, there is not much need for a game like digital LotR like there was/is a need for game like tabletop LotR. LotR's super bad tabletop core set experience worked because there was no alternative. This won't happen with the digital version. People who play digital have too much free alternatives that are free, offer much more game time and replayability.

An other example: For Honor, it had disappointing results, but got supported and is still alive today. Sure no hit or CoD/Battlefield, but not everything can become a mass phaenomenon.

LotR LCG has no name on PC, doesn't distinguish itselff enuff from other games, takes a lot of money for virtually no content.

It succeeds - they think dumbing down tabletop stuff is ok and we never see any proper port of anything. They don't succeed - they are scared off the digital realm and either withdraw entirely or start doing even less risky and more dumbed down stuff.

I still firmly believe that with the same basic ideas/systems they have here they could make an amazingly satisfying and challenging game.  I have to admit though, I don't actually see the game taking this trajectory.  I stopped back in to try this supposedly extremely difficult challenge scenario they released and I beat it on hard on my first try with a perfect score. I feel that this is somewhat telling of some deeper issues with the design. In theory if I was incredibly enthused about it I could intentionally give myself handicaps to make it more interesting but even then that's not the way I personally like to play. I don't feel it's my job to make the game challenging.  There are a few other philosophical choices throughout the design I simply find baffling. Honestly though, even with all decisions I consider poor design, I would still find this game quite defend-able if there was simply more content and harder content. That said, it isn't there. And due to their strange priorities, it doesn't look like it's going to be there anywhere near in time.\n\n \n\nAs for who it'd appeal to, hard to say given what is there now. But I would point out that there are plenty of people out there like me who simply like challenging strategy games and don't particularly care whether the challenge comes from another player or an AI with an unfair advantage so long as it is possible to think your way to an advantage of your own.  This doesn't take a complex system or a good AI. I like card games as I find that deck building tends to allow for a decent amount of depth and expression.\n\nEdited November 26, 2018 by Velensk"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3549771","commentId":3549771,"userName":"Buhallin","timestamp":1543357491,"content":"> 22 hours ago, Velensk said:\n> \n> Overall I agree with you but I'll always caution anyone who says numbers don't lie.

In particular, it's worth noting that a short singleplayer game will not have a high concurrent player count no matter how worthwhile or not it was for however long it lasted. \n\nAnd I'll always caution anyone who offers \"Don't trust the numbers because...\" reasons without actually trying to analyze those reasons :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nYes, the nature of the game is one that will lend itself to a lower concurrent player count.  But that doesn't mean that it's meaningless.  Trends can be especially important, because it's only comparing the game to itself.  What's the trend for LOTR?  A pretty big spike when it initially went early access, and then it fell off a cliff.  It's not really hard to interpret that - the initial hype and advertising got the attention of a number of players who were excited to try it, but it didn't stick with many of them.  Why didn't it stick?  Lack of content is definitely an issue, but the question then is can they produce content fast enough to keep people playing?  It went to EA on Aug 28.  The 29th shows 290 players.  Two weeks later it's at about 70.  Losing 75% of the players in two weeks is pretty awful.  If 75% of your players get bored with the content in less than two weeks and leave, how much content do you have to produce to keep them playing?  Is there any realistic possibility of doing so?  Now it's peaking in the 20s, though it did get a nice spike from the new announcement - almost back to the \"Only lost 75%\" mark, but not quite.\n\nThe other component to the drop (or not) is new players.  Even if your players only stay active for 2 weeks, if you're bringing in new people at an equal rate to replace them your numbers don't drop.  It looks like the initial hype, likely driven largely by existent physical players, got the bulk of the people it was going to get.\n\nSo yes, there are caveats in the numbers.  It's certainly more complicated than simply citing a number and saying you're right.  But none of the numbers we have are consistent with the game being well-received, either by new players or by the people who should have been the most excited about it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3554819","commentId":3554819,"userName":"BigKahuna","timestamp":1543766108,"content":"Agreed with the above, if the online LCG fails to capture and hold onto the paper lcg players, the chances of it being successful is slim to none.  It needs them and that part of the game community has spoken loud and clear, the answer is no, this is what the numbers show and though I agree that numbers are not conclusive evidence , there is no other evidence of any kind to suggest anything otherwise.\n\nThat said there is still time for the devs to deal with the reality of their enterprise and make adjustments but to this point there attitude suggests they are moving forward with the game as planned in a defiant act of willful ignorance, the situation has all the makings of an indie developer about to learn a hard lesson in listening to their community.\n\nEdited December 2, 2018 by BigKahuna"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3556895","commentId":3556895,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1543927153,"content":"But real question, can we get this on our IOS phones yet?

Right now, since it is so dumbed down, it feels like a game I'd piddle with on my phone or iPad rather than my tower. I don't see myself ever dipping into expansions for the digital edition.\n\nEdited December 4, 2018 by angryew0k"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284717-huge-update-inbound-for-lotr-lcg-on-steam/?do=findComment&comment=3559629","commentId":3559629,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1544123180,"content":"I have an early access for the selling if anyone's interested"}]}
