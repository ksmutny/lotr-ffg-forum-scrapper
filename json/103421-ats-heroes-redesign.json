Or add that 1 point to her willpower, making her value level for lore go up instantly.\n\nAs it stands now that point is wasted, unless you use a readying effect.\n\n-ability- should have worked for every player. I.e. my buddy got 1 lore hero? -1 start threat for you too. Would be a nice added multi-player bonus.\n\nPippin:\n\n-stats- fine\n\n-ability- ahhh Spippin...where to start? How about making it usable without the 2 other hobbits restriction. What's the point (besides theme)? Then make the ability raise your threat by 1, or maybe even free.\n\nOr another thought, let the ability work in any phase, on any player. That way I can see him combo with many different cards. (Trap deck anyone?) this guy should get an errata...\n\nFaramir:\n\n-stats- too high. Let's give him Legolas stats instead, or even with 2 attack, lowering his threat more.\n\nThe way he is now just doesn't work for his intended play style. What where they thinking?\n\n-ability- fine\n\nTheoden:\n\n-stats- fine\n\n-ability- instead of boosting willpower for tactics, which is nice but meager, I think he should have boosted the willpower for all Rohan heroes instead. Then when he is ready, like Dain, he could also give a defensive boost to Rohan characters, (think defensive formations in cavalry for theme)as they don't excel in this spot.\n\nIMO they really missed out on the opportunities in AtS heroes.\n\nGlad Caleb is the captain of this ship now.\n\nHow would you guys redesign these?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103421-ats-heroes-redesign/?do=findComment&comment=1041865","commentId":1041865,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1396949301,"content":"Yeah, some of them seemed to be weird, though I still mostly like them. I prefer going a little less now than more.\n\nFirst off, I think Mirlonde is quite strong for a mono-Lore deck. There she basically is 5 threat cost with 2 willpower and 2 attack, no Glorfindel (rightly so) but very, very good.\n\nFaramir is hard to put into a deck. I have tried. And I have had fun trying but I agree, less hp, less defence even, less treat cost definitely.\n\nThéoden, I wonder if he did not boost other players and instead boosted allies as well, if he were over-powered. I am thinking not, because the allies are usually made for other things than questing. So yes, that is what I would have liked to see instead.\n\nPippin without the all-Hobbit requirement, then he could pair up wonderfully with Dúnhere.\n\nCaldara without the \"other\" but just \"every printed Spirit hero you control\". Pulling three Spirit allies would be well worth it, I believe, especially considering Fortune or Fate.\n\nI do not even play Hirluin, and have not done so for a long time now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103421-ats-heroes-redesign/?do=findComment&comment=1041868","commentId":1041868,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1396949677,"content":"Hirluin is fine by me.\n\n \n\nmed_mirlonde-tdf.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_mirlonde-tdf.jpg]\n\n \n\nAbility text change:\n\nEach Silvan hero or a hero with a printed Lore resource icon you control gets -1 threat cost.\n\n \n\n \n\nmed_pippin-eaad.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_pippin-eaad.jpg]\n\n \n\nAbility text change:\n\nResponse: After an enemy engages you, raise your threat by 1 to return it to the staging area or make it engage another player of your choice.
