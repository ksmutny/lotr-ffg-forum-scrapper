Take the example of the two alternate versions of Aragorn I suggested above- thematic abilities for the spheres - and I think Aragorn is a character you could probably argue for ANY of the four spheres, but you can't just bust Aragorn down to 1 attack or defence if he's now a spirit hero, or reduce his willpower to one if you say he's tactics.\n\nYES, keep the flavours of the spheres, but not at teh expense of the rich stock of Middle-Earth material we have to draw on - go too far down that route, and you'll soon have something ridiculous, like an Elf-Lord who saved Frodo from 5 Nazgul, and prevented them from entering Rivendell, suddenly ending up with only 1 defence.
