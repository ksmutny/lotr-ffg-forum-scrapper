In a co-op game you could easily make things way too easy or way too hard when building a scenario/encounter deck your self if the goal was simply to beat the scenario.\n\n \n\nMy guess is that all the scenario/encounter cards have point values, so easier cards give you less points, tougher cards give you more, and then you could try to beat your best score. This would encourage making the shadow deck as tough as possible for a higher potential score with the risk being greater chance of failure, and would also allow for competitive play in a co-op game by comparing scores between different groups and/or players."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/34559-do-not-stand-alone-an-overview-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/?do=findComment&comment=350088","commentId":350088,"userName":"Majo3","timestamp":1282966659,"content":"kjpw_88 said:\n\nFrank6 said:\n\n \n\nThey awoke the Balrog (which hopefully hints that a Balrog could be in this game), and the aftermath was seen in The Fellowship of the Ring.
