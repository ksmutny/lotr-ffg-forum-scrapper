It was also available at GenCon:\nhttp://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-land-of-shadow/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-land-of-shadow/]\n\nhttps://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/7/23/trapped-in-the-land-of-shadow/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/7/23/trapped-in-the-land-of-shadow/]\n\nhttps://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/7/28/a-heavy-burden/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/7/28/a-heavy-burden/]\n\n \n\nEscape from Mount Gram, the second AP of the Angmar Awakened cycle was released:\nhttps://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/7/30/time-to-escape/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/7/30/time-to-escape/]\n\n \n\nThere is also the annual GenCon quest. The quest is called The Ruins of Belegost and it somewhat resembles the Dwarrowdelf cycle quest in ambiance.\n\nYour goal is to (as far as I understood it) secure loot and the loot you secure lead to a different path in different combinations. Meanwhile, a dragon is trying to roast you.\n\n \n\nAny news that I missed, feel free to comment and I'll add it. Thanks in advance.\n\n "}]}
