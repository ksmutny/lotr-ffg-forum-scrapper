Yes. Most of the 2x cards you definitely need at 3x. 3? Matter of opinion. Honestly for me the 3rd set would be for Dwarven Tomb (so good, very necessary), Beorn, Unexpected Courage & Celebrian's Stone. All are great cards that could use 3 copies. But the set online is $27.00, so that would be almost $7.00/card and I'm not ready to start paying that for this game yet. So I printed out proxies for those.
