(not in a big way at least)\n\n/wolf"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50886-thalin-vs-eastern-crows/?do=findComment&comment=508116","commentId":508116,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1312338472,"content":" I had this happen to me the first time I played a two player game of Journey Down the Anduin.  My friend and I just decided to have Thalin skip questing for one round in order to keep the game interesting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50886-thalin-vs-eastern-crows/?do=findComment&comment=508147","commentId":508147,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1312342379,"content":"GhostWolf69 said:\n\nA strange situation occurred the other night when we had two Eastern Crows left in the deck.... they were simply rotated and killed every Quest phase and we never got to recycle the Encounter Deck as a result, since Thalin was questing all the time...

I think that is prettyg good.\n\nBUT... it was boring as hell. My co-player had a Tactics deck and we had three fights in total during the whole game... I think only one of the Mordor Hunters ever came out, the rest was discarded using Forced Effects of the Quest Cards or drawn as Shadow Cards... and suddenly... we had the scenario on a head-lock. A boring and uninteresting one at that.\n\nLuckily it was over fast.\n\n/wolf"}]}
