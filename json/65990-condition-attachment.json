When an encounter card (such as Caught in a\nWeb, CORE 86) becomes an attachment and attaches\nto a character, that character’s controller does not gain\ncontrol of the attachment.\"\n\nSo you are right, you can't discard Caught in a Web to Forest Spider's Shadow effect.\n\nThe antidote to evil Condition attachments is Miner of the Iron Hills. He is a very handy fellow indeed as he can also deal with Sacked!, Watchful Eyes and Freezing Cold - all of them rather nasty."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65990-condition-attachment/?do=findComment&comment=644620","commentId":644620,"userName":"klarlack","timestamp":1339684591,"content":" thank you a lot! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
