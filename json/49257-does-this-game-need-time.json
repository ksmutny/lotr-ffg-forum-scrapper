For example, one trick in MtG is to buff a creature after it gets hit for damage to save it like Giant Growth (+3/+3 until end of turn). Since Giant Growth resolves first, the creature gets big before the damage hits kills it. So the Lightning Bolt (deal 3 damage) which would've killed a 2/2 now cannot kill the 5/5.\n\n \n\nHowever, the healing mechanic in LOTR doesn't have an interrupt effect on the game. The full amount of damage from an attack has to be put on before you can do anything about it. In LOTR a single attack of 5 damage will always kill a character with 5hp. This is probably intentional as it makes the game much more difficult and different from MtG. Similarly, you can't \"in response\" exhaust characters to get some benefit out of them after they are killed. Beravor's ability can't be put on a stack to resolve before she is killed. This makes you have to be extra careful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49257-does-this-game-need-time/?do=findComment&comment=494133","commentId":494133,"userName":"Dante1","timestamp":1309547193,"content":"SiCK_Boy said:\n\nMake it 99 %.

There is already have a deck with one is impossible to lose.\n\nIn solo game maybe you still cam lose but in Coop game start to be walking in the park. This is very wrong and nothing to do with adventures joy. Adventures must be DANGEROUS other wise is boring. If after fourth of fifht turn youy understand you win becouse you know the encounter deck, you now what coming next and yoy half half of your deck in your hand  lot of resources. I call this kicking the baby( i mean encounter deck). I hope hunt for gollum change it but many report say the quest even more easy then core set quest. So if there is no challenge what we must to do????\n\nI dont understand this.  Coop game i dont want t play anymore we win all teh time. Even we play and reveal 3 cards in 2 player game. Still we win easy.\n\nVery strange balance in this game.If not Tolkien I already sell my core set long time ago.  I dont think game will have a big future. Otherwiise they must change balance , reduse the crazy draw  cards every turn with lore and really start to work to make quests more interesting and dangerous.\n\nThe idea of the game is briliant anyway i hope ffg will do everythink right.\n\n "}]}
