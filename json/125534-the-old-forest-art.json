You do have to earn the boon by putting 13 damage on Old Man Willow however which isn't easy... he raises threat like crazy.\nI believe that Barrow Downs also only has a boon and no burdens but its a one use card for the whole campaign whereas Old Bogey-Stories can be used throughout the whole campaign as an extra mulligan or even mulligan during the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125534-the-old-forest-art/?do=findComment&comment=1309249","commentId":1309249,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1414077069,"content":"I'm sorry to say this, but we already had all picture spoilers for this scenario since Gen Con.

Cannot wait to get my hands on the cards and see them first-person.
