There are 3 compleatly seperate keywords for entering the discard pile, and no keyword for entering it from the hand. Most games use \"discard\" to indicate placing a card from your hand into the yard. But as I said , discard is one of three keywords that mean the same thing, for now at least, having the three keywords means that in future cards they could make effects that trigger off these slightly diffrent meanings.. but for now they are exactly the same meaning... and that meaning is \"entering the discard pile from  IN PLAY\"\n\nThis is why protector of Protector of Lorien has the qualifying text \"from your hand\" printed on it. So unless you see \"from your hand\" it means \"discard  FROM PLAY\""}]}
