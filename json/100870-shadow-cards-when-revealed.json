Forced: two shadow cards. I flip first one and it has a shadow effect (Pursued by Shadow, and ain't that right!) But there is a When Revealed above it. Do both actions occur?\n\nI know.

If I am not making engagement checks: JAtA. 2B.

First, thanks so much. This aggravating game is really fun.\n\nSecond, if I turn that question around,I can still engage as many enemy as I wish on 2B? We're just not looking at engagement numbers versus mythreat.\n\nNow. Do I have that right?\n\nI just started but I've seen you a lot on the boards.
