(what I did). \n\nSame with Fallen into Evil, I once had a really cool game where for a brief moment Haldir succumbed to the lure of the ring but was quickly calmed down and healed of this affliction by Halbarad and some Athelas just before he could let loose an arrow straight into Frodo's face. Perhaps Elrond made a big mistake sending Haldir instead of Legolas in my alternate universe  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174543-seating-your-threat-level-treason-on-saruman-1st-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1599808","commentId":1599808,"userName":"OlorinCZ","timestamp":1430381658,"content":"Everybody here talking about Grishnak nibling on Beorn for 10 rounds as a captive and I´m just here sitting in the corner whispering: \"Pipin with 2 HP, which I have choosen at the end of Road darkens not knowing what will happen, please don´t die, please, please.\" :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\nAnd yes. The thematic possibilities and choices are excellent. In my game Merry has Fallen into Evil. \"I want to be the ring-bearer. You get all the glory, thats not fair. Give it to me.
