They also go over how a hand size limit is needed.\n> \n>  \n> \n> If you made a good outlands deck and then added in Gandalf and Hirluin are you telling me that you wouldn't crush things? He can also now pay for those allies on top and just imagine the sheer power of drawing an additional card each turn with his staff.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I want quests - better quests that are fun and challenging. That is how you keep this game going. Not giving us insanely powerful cards.\n\nis ok man. you are like a me. No prob we have Nightmare mode for that. it is difficult even with that Gandalf. for now only outlands is overpower but.....is only one deck which i can win Return to Mirkwood Nmode.

The more cards you have in your hand, the less he can contribute to paying for cards. On the other hand, resource generation = card draw for him in a way. The more resources we have (especially on Gandalf because he can pay for any of them), the more cards we can pull off the deck and play.

Yeah obviously I choose Bifur to pass Gandalf's resources, and that was certainly helpful at times in the early game, especially to get Gildor in, but late game I was not doing this at all. I used gandalf quite a bit to play the top card during planing for 2 cost spirit allies or attachments and later in the round if an event was on top he could play it, and possibly another event after that. So, Gandalf's resources were always being put to good use and I never felt like they were just piling up. I suspect this would be the case even without bifur, since if it was not for the high cost of Gildor I might not have had to pass any resources at all, but Gildor was essential to the deck as you'll read below.\n\nAnother thing thing that was good about Bifur is he is only 7 threat, so he is a really good fit for the deck with a starting threat of 26. Sure it would be cool to have Elrond, Gandalf, Glorfindel, but starting at 32 threat is usually a death sentence for even some of the most powerful heroes in Middle earth, and I was testing my deck on nightmare scenarios, JAtA and Khazad-dum scenarios, which it did fine on, almost made some of them easy, but not always.\n\n2. I found Gildor to be almost essential to the deck. There were 6 cards that could could only be played by Gandalf and burning Brand needed to be played from the top of the deck to attach to Gandalf. There were numerous times when these cards showed up in my opening hand or I got cornered into having to draw them. With Gildor i could get those cards back in the deck to play again. I had Stargazers in the deck but took them out because Deck manipulation became Gildor's main role. Without him I could easily have gotten stuck with cards in my hand that were essential to the deck and now were unplayable.\n\nSo, yes I think top deck manipulation is going to be key if you are playing sphere specific attachments on him or you are splashing spheres that are not represented by any of your heroes. But if your doing any of the above it should not be an issue.\n\nI can't say enough about how powerful his staff is. The extra resource early game is pretty incredible. Mid late game I was using it for card draw, and since I had Burning Brand on him I did not need the shadow removal, but it is another great option without the brand.\n\nI think the most important thing to maximize Gandalf is readying effects. I had all 3 Unexpected courages on him If they showed up, and they usually did since card draw was so good in the deck, Expert Treasure hunter just became one of the best source of card draw in the game for a Gandalf deck at least.\n\nOverall, Gandalf is pretty fun to play with, although there is a lot of deck manipulation and fiddley bits that might not make him a hit with all types of players, since it's a bit of work to set him up the way I was playing him, but there are other ways to play him, so he is not pigeon holed into one type of build which is great, and should fit into decks that just want to draw cards and play them without all the concern of getting dead cards stuck in hand."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1188960","commentId":1188960,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1407508291,"content":"One other thing, card draw was almost an issue sometimes, since drawing cards might mean i could get stuck with a card in my hand I could not play. So even if I had 3 Expert Treasure hunters in play with 3 questing heroes, i might only trigger it at all especially if I did not know what was below the card on top of my deck. If the next card was one that needed to be played from the top of the deck, I was would then be stuck drawing it next round, and now had to rely on Gildor to get it back in the deck.\n\nSo, drawing the whole deck like crazy was a bit counter productive, and I began to take a more cautious approach, but even so, by round 10 I'd usually almost gone through my whole deck, and this is leaving out many of the powerful draw cards that many of my other decks had relied on in the past. A large part of this is due to Gandalf's passive form of draw by playing the top card of the deck every so often, but his also came with the same risks I mentioned above, so it's a really interesting way to play.\n\nThat's why top deck manipulation is going to be key for the style of deck I was playing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1188989","commentId":1188989,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1407509361,"content":"Have you used Will of the West?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1189027","commentId":1189027,"userName":"Mich the One","timestamp":1407511277,"content":"Thanks, Tracker, lots of very interesting observations.

I'll first have to discard the card, then I will need Will of the West, and then hopefully the card will show up in way that I will not get stuck drawing it again, if it ahows up at all now that it has been reshufled into the deck, and if for some reason i get stuck drawing the same card again then It was all for nothing.\n\nThere might be some potential there, since Will of the West will at least give me another chance but it's not a solid solution like Gildor, and he also removes the need to discard the card first. Of course you get all that for the the cost of 5 resources. But with Biffur and Gandalf Staff I can get him in to play on turn 2 or when ever he shows up. I started to run 3 copies of him since he was so crucial. The extra copies are also nice combo with Flame of Anor, and Gildor in play can even make sure it happens.\n\nI think another option if it's an ally and I'm playing spirit is to find a way to get the card in the discard pile, and if it is a splashed sphere ally use stand and fight."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1189064","commentId":1189064,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1407512707,"content":"Protector of Lorien + Will of the West may be a pretty good salvation to your fear of drawing whole deck too fast problem."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1201173","commentId":1201173,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1408103726,"content":"Question about Gandalf staff and the Lonely mountain scenario hobbit #5.\n\nSmaug makes additional attack if he is dealt a shadow card with a burgle effect.

This must have been raised before by someone, but you can build some ridiculously unbeattable solo deck with him.\n\nI just tested a deck with :\n\nGandalf/Galadriel/Denethor\n\n1 dwarven tomb\n\n1 will of the west\n\n2 legacy of numenor\n\n3 Elrond counsel\n\n3 Cram\n\n3 Blood of numenor\n\n3 fire of Gondor\n\n3 daeron's rune\n\n3 wealth of Gondor\n\nAnd plenty of 0 casting cost cards (love of tales, healing herbs, expert treasure hunter, a good harvest, etc).\n\nBasically, in your first planning phase you play until you reach dwarven tomb or will of the west (you activate Galadriel end draw it), then when the second card (dwarven tomb or will of the west) is on top of your deck, you play will of the west.\n\nThen you start with a full deck and a will of the west in the discard, you play all the cards of the deck (playing the dwarven tomb on will of the west). When the deck is finished, you play will of the west and restart a loop.\n\nIf you are stuck with a card you cannot play in hand, you use the daeron's runes.\n\nWith each loop, you gain 3 will and 9 threat (elrond counsel), you lose 8 threat and earn 6 ressources with the 2 legacy of numenor.\n\nSo running a number of loops you want, you can choose to start the questing phase beeing at :\n\n= 0 threat\n\n= Xxxx ressources on each of your hero\n\n= each hero at + xxxxx wi\n\nPlus with cram and denethor, you can have the card you want from the encounter deck on top\n\nPlus, if you are in a scenario, where you need to kill an enemy, you have Denethor with 3 Cram with Blood of numenor and fire of gondor and xxxx ressources on him to deal with the combat.\n\nI cannot see that deck lose to any quest (healing herbes infinite to pass rhosgobel), except may be for Dol guldur if Gandalf is prisoner cancelling his ability.\n\nSome cards need to be errataed !!\n\nEDIT : no errata needed, gandalf power is limited once per phase, I will read the cards completely next time, sorry\n\nEdited August 19, 2014 by Courchevel"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1213004","commentId":1213004,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1408484133,"content":"> Basically, in your first planning phase you play until you reach dwarven tomb or will of the west\n\nGandalf may only use his ability once per phase.
