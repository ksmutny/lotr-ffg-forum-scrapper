I've found it hard to include the original Aragorn into decks that weren't leadership heavy because I just don't like the combo of his high starting threat and his text being less than useful until you get your resource engine set up. In short, I just didn't see the King of the Free Peoples being wanted everywhere. But I can see all sorts of starting fellowships (sorry, old Decipher game coming back to me) for the Boromir in me to use with this Aragorn precisely because of the ability to see your threat climb up to 45 and go \"WAIT!\". In short, he's going to be wanted everywhere. \n\nOne other thing that I'm thinking of: FFG needs to think long term if they want this game to continue, and I think this card shows that. Based on current patterns, we can expect 8 heroes every cycle. Sure, there's lots of characters that they could choose from, but many people are probably like me. They probably want to play with the 9 of the Fellowship, Bilbo, Faramir, and other big name guys. Mablung, Damrod, Halbarad...sure it'll be nice to see these people. But I want my heroes to be HEROES.\n\nWhen the original set came out there was talk about including FFG originals such as Thalin as being kind of lame. Sure, the cynical side is that they're stretching out the heroes we want to make more money. But the objective side can admit that maybe saving some of the desired heroes, like Merry, Sam or Pippin, for later can help sell those later items. If getting a new Aragorn in a pack now means that they feel they can save Merry and Pippin to be the two heroes in the next Deluxe Expansion then I'm all for it. They need to sell the Deluxe Expansions so that people can pick and choose their adventure packs in that cycle. I see the Deluxe Expansions as key to the business model, because if you choose to not get one, you're choosing to not get the next 6 released items, either.\n\nIn conclusion: Aragorn now, mid-cycle, is probably good timing to save a desired, not yet released, hero or two for the next Deluxe Expansion. And I'll really want to play with this new Aragorn from a deckbuilding perspective, so I'm glad he's coming out now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63187-holy-crap-they-already-did-itwe-have-got-a-new-aragorn/?do=findComment&comment=618532","commentId":618532,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1334621368,"content":"Chris51261 said:\n\nconykchameleon said:\n\n \n\nCan someone calmly articulate what all the hate is about?

While I think it is unnecessary to duplicate this early I like the new version of Aragorn much better. It feels much more accordiing to the story. He is sort of a hidden weapon - most of the game he is clearly not as strong as the guys like Imrahil or Boromir (not thinking the attachments now) but then he can change everything.

This Strider is cool (although I prefer my own version) Disco Bilbo is hideous, and Glorfindel is pitiful compared with what Glorfindel should be.\n\nAt least whilst they're issuing additional versions of Aragorn or Bilbo, they aren't bringing out swarms of Hobbits who have no business in the game. The whole reason Bilbo was so significant was that what he did was so unhobbitish. Generic Took allies are reasonable, but I think it's already a bit dubious having Frodo pre-Fellowship, and I definitely don't want to see Sam, Merry or Pippin - none of them ever left the Shire or had any reason to! \n\nNew heroes should be folks like Halbarad, Faramir, Theodred, Angbor, Thranduil, not characters who would never have been getting involved in fights with Orcs.\n\nBit annoyed about the sample deck list that is so heavily reliant on 3x celebrian's stone to play all of those Spirit Cards.
