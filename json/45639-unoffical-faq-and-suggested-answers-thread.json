As FFG provide official FAQ updates, this thread will be updated with official answers where the unofficial answer is different from the official one.\n\nUpdated following 1.2. FAQ\n\nSplit into Game Phases and Core and expansions. Kept the original numbering incase any other web sources refer to them.\n\nGeneral Rule Questions\n\n61. When, exactly, can I play actions?\n\nAn important section of the rule book is page 30 of the Rule Book, concerning the flow chart.\n\npage 30 of the Rule Book.\n\n\"Green – Any player can take actions generally, or\n\nbetween the game steps stated in the rules.\"\n\nThis supercedes other sections of the rule book, which may only refer to allowing actions at the end of a rule step; providing that step is green, you may play actions during as well as at the end of that step.\n\nHero text\n\n8. How does Thalin's ability interact with cards with only 1 hit point that have a when revealed action or surge key word? Is the text ignored because Thalin kills it as soon as it revealed or do the surge or when revealed action still occur\n\nThalin's ability resolves before any Keyword or when revealed effects.\n\n12. How does Dunhere's ability work?\n\nDunhere can attack enemies in the staging area during the phase when other heroes attack (enemies engaged). Dunhere's +1 only works when he attacks an enemy in staging and only when attacking alone, the two are mutually inclusive. Dunhere's attack rating is compared against the enemies’ defence rating as normal. Dunhere' does not deal direct damage.\n\n20. How does Legolas' ability or the Misty Mountain Goblin card work if there is an active location?\n\nThe active location works as a buffer when adding progress tokens, as described in the rulebook so progress tokens are added to the active location first, unless a card effect specifically states that it bypasses any active location. However, when a card refers to removing progress tokens from the quest (card), this is always from the main quest card, never from an active location.\n\n21. Can you have cards in your player deck from a sphere that doesn't match the sphere of one of your heroes?\n\nThere is nothing in the rules that directly disallows this, although the player will be required to play specific card combos to be able to play those cards\n\n36. Can a character such as Legolas or dunhere, who can attack enemies with which they are not engaged attack those enemies more than once per round using cards such as Unexpected Courage?\n\nPlayers can only declare one attack against an enemy whether they are engaged with them, or whether the attack is possible through keywords such as ranged. However, if through a card effect, a second attack is somehow possible with that character, then that attack can occur against an enemy already attacked this round.\n\n45. Does Frodo's Response allow him to survive against the Muck Adder's forced effect?\n\nYes. As Frodo cancels the damage and turns it into threat, the Muck Adders forced effect does not occur.\n\n56. When using Eleanor's ability, does the when revealed effect of the replacement card trigger?\n\nYes, the replacement card is still revealed so any card text triggers as normal.\n\n60. If Eleanor cancels a card's when revealed effect and the card also has keywords such as Doomed or Surge, what happens?\n\nEleanor's ability only cancels the when revealed effect, any other keywords on the card trigger as normal. If a Surge or Doomed effect would occur as part of the when revealed condition and that condition is cancelled, Surge and/or Doomed does not occur.\n\nGeneral Card text - Core\n\n2. How does the Forced action on the Dol Guldur beastmaster work? When is the extra shadow card applied, and as it uses the words \"After xxx attacks\" (in the same way that Chieftain Ufthak has) how does the Chieftain's forced action work in comparison?\n\nThe DGB card is interpreted as having the word When rather than After. This means that DGB is dealt two shadow cards. Chieftain Ufthak's ability resovles after step 4 of combat so has an initial combat strength of 3 in the first round in which he engages a player, 5 in the second round and so on.\n\n6. Can you use Protector or Lorien to discard multiple cards to obtain > 1 defence or willpower bonus per round/phase?\n\nYes.\n\n10. When encounter cards come into play outside of the quest phase what parts of the card are still relevant? The description of surge/doomed states this only applies during staging step of quest phase, so is that keyword ignored? How about cards such as Pursued by Shadow, as outside of the quest phase NO hero is considered committed to a quest (although they may still be exhausted from previously committing to the quest), so is the when revealed affect applied to all heroes or is it ignored completely?\n\nSurge, Doomed and Guarded resolve any time a card with those keywords is placed in the staging area, even during set-up. Other card effects resolve as intended, so in the case of pursued by shadow the effect applies as if no characters were committed to the quest.\n\n11. Are attachments considered their own card for purposes of exhausting (such as \"Steward of Gondor\") or does the hero they are attached to need to be exhausted to use them? The card says \"Exhaust Steward of Gondor\" which makes me believe it is just the card, and you can use it every turn to get a bonus 2 resources.\n\nYes only the card is exhausted, not the hero.\n\n24. How does Beorn's ability work with sneak attack?\n\nBoth cards have exactly the same trigger condition and therefore you can choose in which order to apply the text. This means you can return him to your hand via sneak attack ruling rather than to the deck by Beorn's own ruling, if you prefer. Whenever there is a timing conflict such as this, the first player always decides which card trigger is resolved first.\n\n28. Does the horn of Gondor ability work for all participating players´ characters or only the player of the card?\n\nThe horn's ability applies to all participating players characters\n\n33. Do the Orc Guards generated by the effects of the Tower Gate location and Out of the Dungeons quest have the Orc Trait?\n\nNo, facedown cards do not have traits unless obtained by a specific card effect.\n\n35. Because of the Dungeon Jailer I need to place an Objective back into the deck,\n\n1) What happens to the Encounter card attached / guarding it?\n\n2) What do I do with it once the Objective card is later revealed from the deck?\n\n1. . The objective goes into the deck, the card gurading it remains in the staging area.\n\n2. Follow the instructions on P. 24 of the rule book. The objective card is placed in the staging area and the next Encounter card is turned to guard the objective due to the guarded keyword.\n\n37. (Especially for the guys at the excellent CardBoardoftheRings!) The Banks of the Anduin Forced effect says to return the card to the top of the encounter pile when TBotA leaves play. Does this include when the card is turned as a shadow card?\n\nOnly a cards shadow effect (text below the Shadow Icon on the card) is resolved when the card is revealed as a shadow card, all other text is ignored. Therefore TBotA will go to the discard pile rather than the top of the encounter deck after being revealed as a shadow card.\n\n38. The text on the Nazgul card states that \"after the shadow effect resolves\" (not shadow card), the engaged player removes 1 character. What does this mean exactly if the encounter card dealt as a shadow card has no shadow effect?\n\nSince the card states shadow effect, if the nazgul receives a shadow card with no effect, his forced ability does not activate (no effect to resolve).\n\n39. In regard to the final quest in the core set,\n\nA. What does it mean when it says players as a group can play only one ally per round?\n\nOnly one ally can be played, TOTAL, per turn by all players combined.\n\nB. When you hold the torch, do you have to raise your threat by 2 or 1+2 (total 3) at the end of the round?\n\nThe torch says to increase by 2, and it is an entirely separate effect from the normal increase at turn end, so that would be 3 total.\n\nC. As guarded means you stick one card from the encounter deck to the objective, and until it is defeated you can't claim it. Can you claim it in every phase or subphase as an action? Can you engage the guarding enemy as normal?\n\nThe attached cards are treated as they normally would be. Enemies engage, attack and can be attacked, locations can be traveled to and explored, treachery cards affect play as usual. When an objective is free from cards it can be claimed as stated on the card itself (presently, all available objectives are claimed as actions).\n\nD. Do you deal shadow cards to the orcs of the last stage (1/1 with one HP)?\n\nThe orc guards are \"treated as enemies\" and so get shadow cards like any other enemy.\n\n43. With Tower Gate, the card you take from the top of you deck to be used as an Orc, what happens to the \"orc\" after you defeat it?\n\nDefeated enemies get put in the discard pile. Since you own the card it gets placed in your discard pile.\n\n55. Can Gandalf be used with Stand and Fight?\n\nNo, Stand and Fight can be used to bring back an ally belonging to any Sphere, but as a Neutral card, Gandalf doesn't belong to any of the 4 spheres.\n\n57. During the set up of Dol Guldur, do the when revealed effects of cards trigger when used to guard the objectives?\n\nNo, those cards are not revealed, they are only attached. Therefore the When Revealed effects of cards used to guard objectives during the set-up of that scenario are not triggered.\n\nGeneral card text - Shadows Of Mirkwood\n\n50. Do cards that grant an extra resource icon grant extra resource tokens of that icon type, or make the existing tokens of that hero more flexible?\n\nCards that add a resource icon such as Song of Wisdom or Song of Kings, only grant an extra icon meaning any resource tokens the hero has now or in the future are more flexible and usable for cards of any icon the Hero has. The do not grant the hero any additional resources unless it is specifically stated in the card effects.\n\n52. How does Radagast's card text work?\n\n1) Radagast's resources can be used to pay for the total cost of any creature ally regardless of sphere, or can be used in combination with the resources of a hero or heroes that match the sphere of the ally, to pay for the total cost\n\n2) Radagast will not override the resource match necessary for playing Creature cards with a cost of 0, as his ability would not be used\n\nPlanning Phase - Core\n\n26. Can you place an attachment on another players hero? Does the hero need to be of the same sphere as the attachment?\n\nAny character that meets the requirements of the attachment can receive the attachment. Unless specifically stated as a requirement on the card, you can play attachments on any hero (or character if the attachment allows), including another players' and/or one that is a different sphere to which the attachment belongs\n\n31. Can I attach two of the same attachment to the same character? Two Citadel plates or Two Protector of Loriens?\n\nThe only restriction currently with attachments is that a single character is restricted to a limit of 2 attachments with the keyword \"Restricted\". This allows you two place 2 citadel plates etc onto the same character (if it helps picture this as being a single suit of better quality armour, rather than 2 separate suits). Note however, that each attachment is treated separately, so if there is a cost to activate the card (as is the case with Protector of Lorien), that cost must be paid for each card individually.\n\n42. If I play Steward of Gondor, can I immediately exhaust it to gain additional resource and then spend those resource immediately to play additional Allies or attachments etc?\n\nThe entire planning phase is coloured green in the process flow, which means actions can be taken freely during that stage, so yes SoG can be played and then immediately exhausted for additional resource to spend.\n\n62. When playing attachments that have requirements (such as being played on a character of a certain sphere), when are those requirements checked?\n\nThe requirements are only checked when attaching, once the attachment has been played and attached, it is not neccessary to discard the attachment if the requirements are no longer met on subsequent rounds.\n\nPlanning Phase - Shadows of Mirkwood\n\n47. If Song of Wisdom is played then Burning Brand is played an the same hero, but that hero later loses the Song of Wisdom attachment do they also lose Burning Brand?\n\nThere is nothing in the rules to support the idea that the Burning Brand is lost. The requirement for Burning Brand to be attached to a lore hero is only at the time of attachment.\n\nQuest Phase - Core\n\n1. If Ungoliant's Spawn has already been defeated, or is already in play when Don't Leave the Path Enter play, what happens?\n\nWe actually have an official answer to this, but i have just added it for completeness, the answer is that if it is already defeated it must be defeated again, but if it is already in play, this does count as it being found and therefore will only need to be defeated once (not twice).\n\n3. If a location in the staging area has enough progress tokens on it (from the Northern tracker for instance), is it immediately removed from play, or does it still have to be made an active location, before it is removed?\n\nIt is removed from play as soon as it has enough tokens on it.\n\n5. When exhausting a character to a quest, do i exhaust a character and then use the Response relating to that character then exhaust the next and so on, or do i exhaust all simultaneously and then apply their responses in any order i want? (Important when using the Aragorn/Theodred combo). How about Old Forest Road and Strength of Will? Can the players travel to OFR, then use SoW, then use the response on OFR to ready the character that was just exhausted to meet SoW, or do the responses on a location take precendence and have to be taken first?\n\nResponses can be used in any order, which solves the OFR vs SoW problem, and a player's heroes committing to the quest is done simultaneously and separately to completing Responses, so all characters can be exhausted simultaneously, allowing Theodred's power to be used on Aragorn and then for Aragorn to ready using the resource he just obtained from Theodred. Note though, that one player commits characters to the quest and plays responses then the next player and so on, this means if the first player had the hero Theodred and commits him to the quest, Theodred's response could not be used to give a resource to a hero of another player as another players heros will not yet have committed to the quest.\n\n13. One of the Spirit ally cards (Northern Tracker) allows him to place a single progress token on every location in the staging area when he commits to a quest. Is this done *before* new cards are drawn and you compare Willpower vs. Corruption?\n\nYes. Northern Tracker's ability is a response so this is done in response to the game occurrence (commiting to a quest) and before any other game occurences occur (such as pulling a new staging card).\n\n14. When dealing cards into the staging area during the questing phase, do i deal 1 card per player, or 1 card per player that has a hero questing this round?\n\n1 card per player.\n\n30. Henamarth Riversong and Glorfindel are questing. In the adventure phase I draw \"The Necromancer's Reach\" and Riversong dies cause of that. Does his Willpower count towards the questing willpower?\n\nThe Willpower vs. threat calculation is completed during step 3 of the Questing phase, only characters still alive and considered questing during that stage have their willpower counted. As Riversong was destroyed during an earlier step, when the new encounter card is added to the staging area, his willpower is NOT counted during stage 3 of the questing phase.\n\n32. If there is an active location (with or without tokens) and despair has just revealed, what do you do?\n\nThe Despair card specifically states removing tokens from the quest card and therefore, as clarified in question 20, the tokens are removed from the main quest card, not the active location.\n\n34. If the first card attached to an objective is a location with \"surge\" keyword, I reveal another card from the encounter deck but where do I place this new \"surged\" card? Do I attach it to the objective, together with the first encounter card - and both of them are protecting the same objective card - or do I place it separately in the staging area?\n\nResolve any keywords as they occur. So you would attach the encounter with Surge to the Objective, then draw an additional card. Just the first card counts as guarding the Objective.\n\nIf you draw another Surge, you resolve it as though you would any other Surge - by drawing an additional card.\n\n44. If I do not quest with any characters do I skip the quest phase? (An old one but I've seen it asked enough times by new players so I've added it to the FAQ)\n\nEven if you do not commit anyone to the quest, the quest phase still occurs, adding additional cards to the staging area and comparing willpower (of 0) against current threat. It is generally a good idea to quest with at least some characters each turn.\n\n48. If Lorien Guide is played and there is no active location, can the progress token be placed on the current quest?\n\nNo, Lorien Guide specifically states active location and therefore if there is no active location no progress token is placed at all\n\n51. When can cards be played during questing? The rulebook P.14 states that cards can be played at the end of each step, where the game flows at the back of the rule book states card canbe played generally during green steps\n\nThe games flows are accurate. Cards can be played at any point during a green step in the game flows. The statement on P.14 is referring specifically to red steps when actions can only be played at the end of the step\n\n58. Is there an upper limit for the number of progress tokens that can be placed on a quest card, for when completing that card has specific requirements such as Kill a specific enemy, in addition to a number of progress tokens?\n\nThere is no upper limit, and excess progress tokens can therefore be used as a buffer against cards such as Misty mountain Goblins, until such time as the quest card can be completed.\n\nQuest Phase - The Hunt for Gollum\n\n59. Does the forced condition on the 1st quest card in the Hunt for Gollum still trigger on the round when that phase of the quest is completed.\n\nThe Forced condition is triggered upon questing successfully. The definition of questing successfully is having total willpower > staging area threat, and is a seperate step to applying progress tokens to active locations/quest cards. Therefore as soon as the players have quested successfully the forced condition should trigger, then total progress tokens are calculated and placed on the quest card, then resolving that phase of the quest if enough are placed.\n\nQuest Phase - Conflict at the Carrock\n\n54. How do you defeat the second quest card as there are no specific victory conditions?\n\nThe entire quest is completed as soon as all Trolls in play are defeated and the 2nd quest card has at least 1 progress token on it\n\nTravel Phase - Core\n\n23. The Brown Lands card says that after player travel place 1 travel token on it, this would mean that the location would cancel itself?\n\nThis is correct. The main issue with the Brown Lands is it excessive threat (5), which must be dealt with prior to travelling to it and the need to be able to make it an active location before you can remove it (unless you have a way of adding progress tokens to cards in the staging area).\n\nCombat Phase - Core\n\n4. If you defend with multiple characters and still take damage, how is that damage applied amongst the defenders?\n\nThe damage is applied to a single defender.\n\n7. If an enemy cannot attack (caught in a forest snare for instance) do they still get dealt a shadow card?\n\nBy the rules, an attack consists of 4 steps (P. 18 rulebook). Dealing a shadow card is not one of those 4 steps but revealing a shadow card is. Therefore by the rules a shadow card is dealt but not revealed and is then discarded at the end of the phase. So the dealing of the card is currently a moot point and only relevant to burn through the encounter deck.\n\n9. If a shadow effect or some other process causes a hero to lose an attachment, does this include negative attachments such as the Caught in a web treachery card? In effect can the shadow effect benefit the hero in this case?\n\nNo. The player is not considered to be in control of such cards as they are never played by a player.\n\n15. Do enemies count as characters for effects such as the horn of Gondor?\n\nNo. They are not characters, only heroes and allies are classed as characters.\n\n16. When a hero can attack twice (such as Aragorn's ability) can both attacks be against the same creature?\n\nYes, but only by using certain card effects. Each player can only attack each enemy once with which he is engaged, when the player is the active attacker. However, if a hero is somehow able to ready after being exhausted from attacking this enemy, and is able to attack through a card effect such as quickstrike then he can then be used to attack the same enemy again.\n\n17. What happens when a \"Hill Troll\" attack goes undefended?\n\n1.) Hill troll's damage all goes directly to threat. OR...\n\n2.) Damage goes unto a hero and spills over into threat.\n\nThe answer is 2. Damage must be applied as in the rules (onto a single hero for an undefended attack), any excess damage is then applied as defined on the Hill Troll card.\n\n18. When is the feint card played? Can it be played in conjunction with the Gondorian spearman as a defender?\n\nBy the rules, an attack consists of 4 steps (P. 18 rulebook). Therefore the feint card must be played before any of these steps occur and once played prevent any of these 4 steps from occurring. As one of these 4 steps is declare defender, Feint and Gondorian defender cannot be played against the same attack in the same round.\n\n19. Do the threat of engaged enemies still count during the questing phase? Do engaged enemies disengage at the end of each round?\n\nOnly the threat of enemies in the staging area count when determining threat during the questing phase. When enemies move from the staging area to engaged with a player, the enemies stay engaged with that player over subsequent rounds unless a specific effect allows them to move back to the staging area. While engaged their threat is no longer counted, in the same way that the threat of an active location is no longer counted.\n\n22. What does \"eligible enemy target\" mean on the Quick Strike card?\n\nEligible means \"any enemy you can normally attack in the combat phase\" quick strike allows you to attack that enemy in any phase. That would mean Dunhere can attack Enemies in Staging and Ranged characters could attack Enemies engaged with other players. Other characters would have to attack Enemies engaged with you. (Thanks to Apophenia for this concisely worded answer)\n\n25. Do treachery cards effects resolve when they are drawn as shadow cards?\n\nOnly cards with a stated shadow effect resolve when drawn as a shadow cards. All other effects on the cards, regardless of card type are ignored.\n\n27. During engagement checks, if there are two enemies with the same threat in the staging area which one engages the player?\n\nEach player makes an engagement check in turn. If there are two enemies with the same threat rating equal to or less than the players threat then the player must choose to engage one of the enemies, which one is the player's choice (through discussion with the other players, if they so wish). Play then proceeds to the next player to make their engagement check and so on.\n\n29. If when defending an attack, the revealed shadow effect deals damage and destroys the defender, is the attack now considered undefended?\n\nP. 18, bottom left: \"If a defending character leaves play or is removed from combat before damage is assigned, the attack is considered undefended.\" In this statement, damage assigned refers to damage generated by comparing attack strength vs. the defenders defence strength. As the defender was destroyed prior to this being calculated (via a direct damage shadow effect) the attack is considered undefended.\n\n40. What happens if your hero takes a bunch of damage while wearing citadel plate, but then has to discard said armor. Would all the damage taken now apply to his unmodiffied Health levels?\n\nAccording to the rulebook, hit points are \"the number of damage required to destroy [a] card.\" Therefore, as soon as a card has a number of damage tokens on it equivalent to its hit points, it is immediately destroyed. So if Gimli had five damage tokens on him, but was still alive thanks to Citadel Plate, the moment that attachment was discarded, Gimli's hit points would of course be returned to their normal value (5), and he would be destroyed.\n\nTo make matters worse, if he had to discard the Citadel Plate due to, lets say, Forest Spider's shadow effect, the player wouldn't even have any opportunity to heal or remove any of those damage tokens before the attachment is discarded since shadow effects are resolved immediately.\n\n41. If Wolf Rider is turned as a shadow card and therefore attacks the player with it's own shadow card, when does Wolf Rider return to the encounter deck?\n\nThe card states that Wolf Rider returns after combat - this means at the end of the entire combat phase, in which case the player can attampt to attack Wolf Rider back if he has an available Hero or ally to do so.\n\n46. Regarding the Despair card's shadow effect that nullifies the defending character's defense, is that just the character card's printed defense? Is it possible to boost the defense with cards like Blade Mastery and Protector of Lorien?\n\nNo, Despair states the character does not count their defence. That is the total defence regardless of how it is obtained.\n\n49. Can Stand Together be played to allow Sentinels to group together to defend against an undefended attack?\n\nNo. Stand Together specifically allows a player to use multiple defenders to defend against an attack on that player, whereas Sentinels are used to defend against undefended attacks against other players. The wording on the cards makes them mutually exclusive.\n\n55. How is it possible to attack the same enemy more than once in a single round?\n\nWithout a specific card effect that can break the golden rule, such a QuickStrike, then while each player is the active player, they may declare only a single attack against each enemy that they may legally attack. Any number of the active players character's that are ready and able to attack that enemy can participate in that attack, In addition, any characters controlled by other players may participate in that attack providing they are ready and able to attack that enemy even if those characters have participated in an attack against that enemy already in the round.\n\nCombat Phase - Shadows of Mirkwood\n\n53. If the shadow card dealt to the Wargs is cancelled by burning brand, does the Wargs retreat to the staging area?\n\nNo. The Wargs card states that it returns to the staging area if it is dealt a shadow card with no effect. Although the effect is cancelled, the card itself still has an effect, it just doesn't affect anything.\n\nNew additions:\n\nQ: When (at which substep of an attack) does \"Striking Tentacle\" 's forced effect trigger? Before step 2, and just preventing the declaration of a defender, or somewhen after step 2 (so I will want to declare a defender and when the attack is undefended, I also have exhausted that character in vain)\n\nA: The forced effect triggers when it attacks, so that would happen in Step 1, before declaring defenders.\n\nQ: When a hero is shuffled into my deck because of \"Lost and Alone\" and shall be attached to a Nameless enemy, is it possible? If yes, is his cost considered 0 or do I have to use his threat cost?\n\nA: Yes it is possible. Heroes do not have cost, so it would count as 0.\n\nAny other unanswered or heavily debated questions I have missed?\n\nEdited September 29, 2013 by pumpkin"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=457808","commentId":457808,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1303494860,"content":"Thanks for compiling this list.  I would add something about whether monsters that can not attack still receive Shadow cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=457812","commentId":457812,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1303495214,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nThanks for compiling this list.  I would add something about whether monsters that can not attack still receive Shadow cards.\n\n\n\n \n\nAdded."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=457895","commentId":457895,"userName":"Shadow1vt","timestamp":1303514277,"content":"What about Thalin's ability to do one damage and surge creatures with one hit point?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=457903","commentId":457903,"userName":"Widowmaker93","timestamp":1303516517,"content":"pumpkin said:\n\n \n\nAs there now quite a few questions and speculation around a few of the cards I thought I'd start a thread to start to collate them so that FFG at least can go to one place. As new questions arise that can't be fully answered by the current rule set or forumites, we can add them to this thread and bump it every so often.\n\nIf you've got a question please ask it in its own thread first and only add it here if us forumites can't come up with a concensus, otherwise this thread will get bogged down with questions and responses, which isn't the intention.\n\nFrom looking at other threads the questions that I don't think have full answers yet are...\n\n1. If Ungoliant's Spawn has already been defeated, or is already in play when Don't Leave the Path Enter play, what happens?\n\nWe actually have an official answer to this, but i have just added it for completeness, the answer is that if it is already defeated it must be defeated again, but if it is already in play, this does count as it being found and therefore will only need to be defeated once (not twice).\n\n2. How does the Forced action on the Dol Guldur beastmaster work? When is the extra shadow card applied, and as it uses the words \"After xxx attacks\" (in the same way that Chieftain Ufthak has) how does the Chieftain's forced action work in comparison?\n\n3. If a location in the staging area has enough progress tokens on it (from the Nothern tracker for instance), is it immediately removed from play, or does it still have to be made an active location, before it is removed?\n\n4. If you defend with multiple characters and still take damage, how is that damage applied amongst the defenders?\n\n5. When exhausting a character to a quest, do i exhaust a character and then use the action relating to that character then exhaust the next and so on, or do i exhaust all simultanously and then apply their actions in any order i want? (Important when using the Aragorn/Theodred combo)\n\n6. Can you use Protector or Lorien to discard multiple cards to obtain > 1 defence or willpower bonus per round/phase?\n\n7. If an enemy cannot attack (caught in a forest snare for instance) do they still get dealt a shadow card?\n\n \n\nAny other unaswered or heavily debated questions I have missed?\n\n\n\n \n\n1) You answered this one correct.\n\n2) DGB gets dealt 2 shadow cards and both are resolved as if his ability read \"when DGB attacks...\" Chieftan Ufthak gets his +2 attack on the next round's attack phase as if his were actually \"after the attack resolves...\"\n\n3) Locations in staging area that have full progress tokens are explored and discarded.\n\n4)You cannot defend with multiple characters.

For example see AGOT's FAQ entry on Play and Put Into Play, and even though you think it counter intuitive it is pretty much like your example above.\n\n(4.4) \"Play\" and \"Put into Play\"\nCharacter, Location, and Attachment cards are\n“played” from the hand during the marshalling\nphase, by taking a player action and paying\ntheir gold cost.\nEvent cards are “played” by placing the card\non the table, paying the specified cost, and\ntriggering the effect.\n\"Put into play\" effects are not considered to be\n\"played.\" Similarly, when a card is \"put into\nplay,\" it does not trigger any \"when played\"\neffects, and vice versa. Both, however, would\n\ntrigger effects that occur when a card \"comes\ninto play” or “enters play.”\n\"Put into Play\" is a game mechanic that\nbypasses all costs (including all gold penalties)\nand play restrictions.\n\nAlso notice in the rulebook the difference in the discriptions of Treachery cards and Event cards\n\nTreachery Cards\nTreachery cards represent traps, curses, maneuvers,\npitfalls, and other surprises the players might confront\nduring a scenario. When a treachery card is revealed\nfrom the encounter deck, its text effects are resolved\nimmediately, and it is then placed in the encounter\ndiscard pile.\n\nEvent Cards\n\nEvent cards represent maneuvers, actions, tactics,\nspells, and other instantaneous effects at a player’s\ndisposal. An event card is played from a player’s hand,\nits text effects are resolved, and the card is then placed\nin its owner’s discard pile.\n\nYou can look at the other card types too, no where but in the hero card section is anything described as played, and all hero cards which are played from hand are described with either play or played. The rulebook makes a clear enough distinction between using the word play or played only in refrence to Hero deck cards that as far as game terms are concerned that only hero deck cards are ever played and thus only hero attachments come under your control.\n\nAs for your other issues, given Driven by the Shadow's text yes you could discard Caught in a Web with it. Also see this thread on Board Game Geek [http://boardgamegeek.com/article/6654218#6654218], Zambo IIRC playtested the game and confirms. I do agree a FAQ entry will be nice but I fully expect it to not consider encounter cards to be under the control of the player whose character it is on."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=459038","commentId":459038,"userName":"kraken78","timestamp":1303760426,"content":"I defer to your ruling.  The use of a credited playtester to support your statement is pretty freakin strong.  FAQ should clear up some of these issues but I believe you are correct and the control issue will remain as you said.  Still, I think it is foolish for \"Driven by the Shadows\" to clear the attachment when another card won't, and when it won't when undefended.  But, like I said before, new card games always run into wording issues."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=459074","commentId":459074,"userName":"Karui_Kage","timestamp":1303771853,"content":" Few questions of my own :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] \n\n \n\n1. Are attachments considered their own card for purposes of exhausting (such as \"Steward of Gondor\") or does the hero they are attached to need to be exhausted to use them? The card says \"Exhaust Steward of Gondor\" which makes me believe it is just the card, and you can use it every turn to get a bonus 2 resources. Seems pretty powerful, but sounds like that is how it should be.\n\n \n\n2. When does... darn, I forgot his name, the guy that can attack enemies in the staging area. When does his ability trigger? We assumed it was during the normal Attack part of Combat, but his card really didn't specify much.\n\n \n\n3. One of the Spirit ally cards allows him to place a single progress token on every location in the staging area when he commits to a quest.

If this is enough to destroy the character then any excess damage (beyond what it took to destroy the character) is applied as threat.\n\nExample 1 : Hero with defence 2 hit points 5\n\nHill troll hits with strength 6, minus defence 2 leaves 4 damage. Hero down to 1 hit point, no threat added.\n\nHero hit again next round, strength 6, minues defence 2 leaves 4 damage. 1 damage is enough to destroy hero, so the excess damage is 3 (4 damage - 1 hit point remaining), so that adds 3 threat.\n\nExample 2: Ally with 0 defence 1 hit point.\n\nHill troll hits for strength 6, minus 0 defence, is 6 damage.

I think the current unofficial answer is against one of the most important rules of all good games: simplicity.\n\nMisty Mountain Goblins, Despair, Blade of Gondolin, Legolas are the cards the ask to \"remove\" or \"place\" progress tokens to the \"current quest\".\n\nThematically, I see very easy to think that the current active location IS THE CURRENT EXPLORATION of my heroes. When they travel, \"Any progress tokens that would be placed on a quest card are instead placed on the active location.\" because they are exploring that location. So this is their current EXTENSION to the current quest and this is easy to understand.\n\nImo it's a good thing that Legolas and the Blade of Gondolin put progress tokens on the current exploration and in the same way we must remove from the current exploration the progress tokens required by encounter cards like Goblins or Despair.\n\nWe don't want to have two different arbitrary solutions to the same wording \"current quest\", do we?\n\nImo, the simpliest thing to do is:\n\n1) put the active location OVER the quest stage card (and its tokens, if any), so I use effectively the location buffer without any chance to forget to place or remove tokens from the buffer.\n\n2) treat in the same way all the cards that have the same wording: \"current quest\" must always have the same meaning on all cards, for simplicity. So if my hero PLACE 1 progress token , I place it on the \"current quest\" that includes the \"active location buffer\" and if I must REMOVE 1 progress token, I remove it from the same \"current quest\" that includes the \"active location buffer\". If I don't have any token in the active location, I must remove it from the current quest, if any.\n\nBut on the \"remove from the current quest\" topic I really need an entry on the official FAQ.\n\nI hope FFG will seek for simplicity."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=463941","commentId":463941,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1304586115,"content":"Could the Orc Guard Q (does Orc Guard have the Orc trait?) be added to the FAQ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=464053","commentId":464053,"userName":"gibbon2","timestamp":1304598175,"content":"With regard to question number 32, I kind of agree with sorty's opinion.\n\nMisty Mountain Goblins, Blade of Gondolin, and Legolas all say to place (or remove) progress tokens from the current quest.\n\nHowever, the Despair card says \"remove 4 progress tokens from the current quest card.\" \n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nSo, if we assume that all the wording in the game is intentional and not just poor editing--and, until they come out with an official FAQ, I don't see why we shouldn't assume that it's intentional--then this seems to suggest that the first three cards are directed toward the quest as a whole, which then falls under the part of the rules that says that any active location acts as a buffer for the quest.  The Despair card, on the other hand, seems to override that restriction and tells the player to go directly to the quest card without regard to the quest as a whole (essentially, ignoring the active location).\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=464077","commentId":464077,"userName":"sortylege","timestamp":1304601703,"content":"Gibbon said:\n\nWith regard to question number 32, I kind of agree with sorty's opinion.\n\nMisty Mountain Goblins, Blade of Gondolin, and Legolas all say to place (or remove) progress tokens from the current quest.\n\nHowever, the Despair card says \"remove 4 progress tokens from the current quest card.\" \n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nSo, if we assume that all the wording in the game is intentional and not just poor editing--and, until they come out with an official FAQ, I don't see why we shouldn't assume that it's intentional--then this seems to suggest that the first three cards are directed toward the quest as a whole, which then falls under the part of the rules that says that any active location acts as a buffer for the quest.  The Despair card, on the other hand, seems to override that restriction and tells the player to go directly to the quest card without regard to the quest as a whole (essentially, ignoring the active location). \n\n\n\nTechnically, you are right, I saw the difference between \"current quest\" and \"current quest card\" but I hoped it's only \"poor editing\".

If there is an active location, then progress tokens are added or removed from that card rather than the main quest.\n\n@Sorty I think the reason the two responses in the FAQ contradict is that there is some wording in the rulebook, to do with active locations, that states \"any progress tokens\" (are added to the location rather than the quest card), which has been used to justify the idea that Legolas should put tokens on the active location in lieu of the quest card. Unfortunately, there is no such wording to back up any notion that cards such as MMG or Despair should remove tokens from an active location rather than the quest card. Therefore the FAQ seems contradictory, but it is based on the best information we currently have available.\n\nI hope and expect when the official FAQ comes out, this will be clarified so that all cards and heros, even Despair, that specifically states quest card, work the same way, as you also suggest. I'm not sure which way FFG will go, but to me it makes sense that the active location is a buffer and therefore always acts as a buffer, which is why i play it that way currently.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=464094","commentId":464094,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1304603659,"content":"ClydeCloggie said:\n\nCould the Orc Guard Q (does Orc Guard have the Orc trait?) be added to the FAQ?\n\n\n\nAdded.

(That is the feeling I get from the FAQ as you wrote it, but I could be misstaken.)\n\nThe Only limitation I can find is around Player Declaration.\n\nAs long as the Player is limited to only declare ONE attack per Creature per Round, it doesn't really matter how many attacks a certain Character could perform.\n\nBut in Legolas case he has the ability to be included in OTHER Players Declarations.\n\nYou see your FAQ seems to Focus on the \"Engaged with\" part of it. I'm trying to apply ONE declaration per monster per round to ALL Monsters regardless of Engagements, but at the same time ALLOW Legolas to be included in other players attacks because that is what the Ranged ability says he can do.\n\n... I'm sorry mate, but I feel like I'm doing a really crappy Job explaining my view here.\n\nOption 1 said:\n\n\"Legolas and Dunhere, can attack the same enemy twice, provided the player is not engaged with that enemy. In essence the characters special ability completely overrides the rule as stated in the rule book, allowing Legolas and Dunhere to attack the same enemy twice in a single round.\"\n\nOk so I'm reading the rules like this:\n\n1. A Player can only ever Declare ONE attack against the same Enemy per Round. (I would apply this to all Enemies, and ignore the \"engaged with\" part because it feels like that was the intention. Nothing will overrule this.)\n\n2. There is nothing in the rules preventing a certain Character from Participating in more than one attack against the same Enemy in the same Round. The limitation only applies to Player Declaration. (Regardless of whether you use apply this rule on Engaged Enemies or not, it is still only limiting Player Declarations and not Characters. That is pretty clear to me at least.)\n\n3. So by that rationale if more than one Player can include a certain Character in his Declaration should be allowed even if that Character has participated in an attack against the same creature earlier that round. In my opinion this does not \"override\" any rules. Since the rule only limits Player Declaration and not Character Participation.\n\n/wolf\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=486091","commentId":486091,"userName":"GhostWolf69","timestamp":1308201325,"content":"And conserning this EXCLUSIVE OR thing I hear you and agree up to a point.

I hope they're not answered elsewhere, in which case I apologize.\n\nFirst: if Bilbo is Sacked!, is the starting player allowed to make a second draw? First I thought no, but then I read rules page 23 again (\"Constant Effects have no bold trigger\"). I think Bilbo's ability is a constant effect. Thus a sacked Bilbo would still allow you to draw another card. Do you think this is correct?\n\n \n\nSecond: I didn't really understand how Radagasts playing-creature-ability works. I can think of those two options:\na.) Radagst allows you to play creatures, because his ressource tokens override the ressource matching rule on p. 12 of the rulebook. So creature cards can be bought with Radagast's still sphere-less ressource tokens.\nb.) Radagast allows you to play creature cards, because his tokens adapt to the required sphere. E.g. Radagast can pay a Winged Guardian because the 2 ressource tokens become tactics ressource tokens. (This does not mean that Radagast is a tactics hero or that his ressources are tactics ressources all the time - they're only converted right in that moment when he's using his special ability).\n\nThe text on Radagast doesn't specify the details further, so both options could be possible. Option a.) is the straight-forward one, I play it like this and it also seems to be the conclusion of the people of this thread: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=540519 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=540519] Yet in that thread I found no arguments against option b.) (I agree with that thread's opinion that a 0-cost tactics creature card requires a tactics hero, but that's not what I'm asking myself.)\nWhile further thinking about option b.), it has the advantage that there is no need for the Golden Rule (overriding rules by card texts). Referring to the FAQ rule 1.00 about the Golden Rule: \"If it is possible to observe both card text and the text of the rulebook, both are observed.\" With option b.), no rule is overridden. So this would be preferable?? What dou you think?\n\nNote that this actually makes a difference, when The East Bank is the active location (\"ally cards cost 1 additional matching resource to play from hand\"). With interpretation b.), Radagast can play Winged Guardian when he has 3 ressource tokens on him; with interpretation a.), 2 ressource tokens can come from Radagast but the 3rd one has to be from a tactics hero, which is not good, because of the Old Wive's Tales.\n\nRegards,\nPete"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=530624","commentId":530624,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1316515544,"content":"I agree with your interpretation re: Bilbo.  I think that since his ability is a constant effect, it'll still provide an extra card while sacked.\n\n \n\nAs for Radagast, I think that choice (a) is correct.  I think (b) is not correct just because there is no support for the idea on the text of the cards.  The only \"ability\" Radagast's resources are imparted by his text is the ability to ignore resource match.  (This is easily the kind of thing I could see being changed via errata/clarification, but for now, I'd go with choice a.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=530722","commentId":530722,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1316527371,"content":" I would like to second Radiskull.\n\nIn regards to Radagast, I do believe (a) is more correct, and that Radagast's \"Resource Match\" is tied to a trait instead of a sphere.  However, using that logic, I also think you could pay three resources from Radagast to play a Winged Guardian while The East Bank is active."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=530982","commentId":530982,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1316574787,"content":"Thanks for your answers!\n\n@radiskull: Someone could argue, that Radagasts card text also doesn't tell anything about overriding the ressource match rule - but then, Radagast could only pay for neutral creature cards, which obviously is not how Radagast is meant to function.

Radagast's ability allows you to override the resource match rule (via the golden rule), when you pay for a card. But if you have a 0 cost card, you don't pay anything, and therefor you don't use Radagast's ability. So the rule on p. 12 is in effect: \"Cards with a cost of zero do not require a resource to be spent in order to pay their cost, but they do require at least one hero under that player’s control to have a resource icon that matches the card’s sphere\". (I hope I'm recalling radiskull's arguments properly, but the arguments above make sense, at least to me.)\n\n \n\nThis is very odd (why can't Radagast gather a 0-cost creature ally when he is capable of gathering a 5-cost Landroval?), so I think if we ask we get an explanation/errata. But currently there is no 0 cost creature card ;-) so nothing to worry.\n\nThe page for submitting can be found under \"More...\", Customer Service, and the a few over clicks.

The rules don't support it. The rules for combat say nothing about the non-active player participating in an attack normally.

Not only is this not supported by the rules, it also directly conflicts with the standard way in which combat is defined.\n\nI see the combat structure as a way of replicating initiative in an RPG, and \"melee\" heroes and allies basically always lose initiative against engaged enemies, unless a specific card or ability (quickstrike) overrides it.\n\nRanged characters have the ability to gain the inititative in some cases, but that only allows them to gain initiative for themselves not other heroes/allies (such has those controlled by player B).\n\nInterestingly, if player B had a ranged character, i think it could participate in the attack of player A, even against an enemy engaged with player B.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=538799","commentId":538799,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1318047659,"content":"Edit: Sorry pumpkin, after re-reading your post again, I figured that you wanted to second Svenn and provide an counter-argument against Kiwina's reading of the rules.

I would want to answer \"no\", and I even prepared some arguments for it, but then I found out that this case has already been covered by the official FAQ, the example after rule 1.11, which says \"yes\" (because Legolas is allowed to join the attack with Quick Strike, again).\n\nI think this is odd in some way, because why would Legolas be allowed to join the attack with Quick Strike again? The logic/the answer might have been \"because he has ranged and therefor is an eligible attacker\". Ok, and now suppose Tom had another ally under control, e.g. Beorn: could he also have joined the Quick Strike? Because he also is an eligible attacker too, because the Hill Troll is enganged with Tom.\nFollowing this logic, when you play Quick Strike, can you declare all your characters as attackers, as long as they are legal attackers? I'd like to say no, but the example in 1.11 tells otherwise... So I play it as the FAQ tells ;-) Of course this makes Quick Strike even better than I thought of it before.\n\nWhat do you and others think? Does Quick Strike allow all eligible attackers to attack? Or am I interpreting too much into the example 1.11?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=538844","commentId":538844,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1318058498,"content":"A character can participate in an attack instigated by using quickstrike if a rule states that they are eligible to join (such as ranged) but quickstrike in and of itself does not make them eligible.\n\nSo if quickstrike is played during the quest phase by player A, for example, then ranged characters controlled by other players could participate in that attack, as ranged clearly states that ranged keyword allows you to participate in attacks declared by other players (and makes no mention of limiting this to a certain phase).\n\nOther characters controlled by player A could not join in however, as the only time players are allowed to declare multple attackers (without the golden rule coming into play) is during the players attack phase of the combat phase.\n\nEven if quickstrike is played, as in the FAQ example (later in the player's attack phase) because this attack is instigated via quickstrike and isn't player A's \"regular\" attack against that enemy, player A can't use more than one character in the quick strike attack, IMO.\n\nSo in summary, quickstrike doesn't say declare eligible attackers, it says declare a character (singular).

But this isn't the case, so they can't be declared as attacker, and therefor can't participate in the combat.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLingual simplicity - I have thought of that, espescially given Nate French's stance on Stand and Fight.\n\nThe first sentence (that I selectively skip over) - \"A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players.\"  My translation: \"If I have a character with the ranged keyword I can declare that character as an attacker against the Misty Mountain Goblins engaged with me, or I can declare that character as an attacker against the Dol Guldur Orcs that are engaged with my friend.\"  I'm pretty sure we all agree on that.  I don't think I'm misreading it either.  Our disagreement revolves less around the first sentence and more around its implications on the second sentence.\n\nNow we get into the semantics. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nThis is how I look at the first sentence affecting the second one.\n\nSecond sentence - \"A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players.\"  This is two independent clauses joined by a conjunction.  I'm going to look at each clause alone, and address the conjuntion.\n\n\"A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks.\"  My translation: \"While I am declaring attacks, I can use my character(s) with the ranged keyword to declare an attack against the Dol Guldur Orcs that are engaged with my friend.\"  This translation is based on \"these targets\" referring to the \"enemies that are engaged with another player.\"\n\n\"or\": Ah, here's the conjunction.  My translation: \"What comes next is an alternate choice that is different from the first one.\"\n\n\"It can participate in attacks that are declared by other players.\"  My translation: \"My character with the ranged keyword can be declared as an attacker against an enemy my friend just declared as the target of an attack.\"  This translation is based on \"it\" referring to my character with the ranged keyword.  My understanding of your argument is that I need to amend this interpretation to specify that it only works if my friend is attacking an enemy that is not engaged with me.  While that may be the intent of the creators, that is not how it's written.\n\nThird sentence (so I don't skip anything else) - \"In either case, the character must exhaust and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack.\"  My translation: \"If I want to use either of the before mentioned options in the second sentence, my character with the ranged keyword must be ready and he must be able to be declared as an attacker against the chosen enemy.\"  So far the only \"other requirements\" would be not having Gandalf's Map attached, and the targeted enemy is not in the staging area, since ranged won't allow me to attack enemies in the staging area.  There may come a time where you have to pay a resource or raise your threat to attack.  In that case those would also become \"other requirements\" that must be met.\n\nAll together (in case you want to skip the specifics):\n\n\"A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players. A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players. In either case, the character must exhaust and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack.\"\n\nMy translation: \"If I have a character with the ranged keyword I can declare that character as an attacker against the Misty Mountain Goblins engaged with me, or I can declare that character as an attacker against the Dol Guldur Orcs that are engaged with my friend.  While I am declaring attacks, I can use my character with the ranged keyword to declare an attack against the Dol Guldur Orcs that are engaged with my friend.  What comes next is an alternate choice that is different from the first one.  My character with the ranged keyword can be declared as an attacker against an enemy my friend just declared as the target of an attack.  If I want to use either of the before mentioned options in the second sentence, my character with the ranged keyword must be ready and he must be able to be declared as an attacker against the chosen enemy.\"\n\nI don't think keywords turn on and off.  Given the example above, I'm going to say the ranged character I have is the Silverlode Archer.  If I attack the Misty Mountain Goblins engaged with me, and I declare my Silverlode Archer as one of the attackers is my Silverlode Archer no longer a ranged character?  I argue that no matter who the Silverlode Archer attacks, he is always a ranged character reaping the benefits of being a ranged character whether he uses the benefits or not.  On a more basic level, if my archer attacks the Misty Mountain Goblins, he shoots them with an arrow.  If he attack the Dol Guldur Orcs, he shoots them with an arrow.\n\nYour main arguments against me are in reference to the term \"ranged attack\" which isn't even used until the second sentence and is never used again in any part of the game.  I don't know of a single card or document that ever uses the term \"ranged attack\" other than that one sentence.  It could be an official game term that has yet to be affected by cards, but it might not.  We don't know.  Never again does the game divide attacks into types of attacks, you just declare attacks.  Dunhere doesn't make a staging attack, but he can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone.  That text is active unconditionally.  I don't see why the keywords Sentinel and Ranged are different.  They don't contain the words Action:, Resoinse:, or Forced: before them.  They should be active as long as the card is in play.\n\nI apologize if this comes across as an attack.  It's not meant to be one.  I'm just trying to write what is going through my head when I read and interpret the ranged keyword.  At this point, for me, this debate is not about whether my interpretation of the Ranged paragraph is right, but that it isn't a wonky misreading of the paragraph.  With all due respect, your interpretation is probably the one the creators meant to have, but when I read it, I understand it differently than you do."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=539438","commentId":539438,"userName":"Ileopsoas","timestamp":1318182826,"content":"Hi I don't know if I can understand well conflict at the Carrock...I set aside all the 4 named trolls at the beginning...then I chose a troll at random at the begginig of 2B quest part...but i don't fell that i right...can yuo explain how to manage the trolls in that quest?\n\nI searched th forum but couldn't find any help on this...\n\nThx u so much!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=539439","commentId":539439,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1318182966,"content":" When stage 2B of Conflict at the Carrock is revealed (when you start that stage), you place all four Trolls into the staging area, not just one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=539442","commentId":539442,"userName":"Ileopsoas","timestamp":1318183300,"content":"Ah ok now its clear...I referred to \"troll\" and not to \"cardS\"...so it's explained why it all seemed so dumb!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=539451","commentId":539451,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1318186041,"content":"Well, I feel like we're going in circles now. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I understand what you are saying.

I do. Honest.\n\nTo me it's just a matter of Golden Rule application: There's card text and then there's Rules as Written.\n\nSo in this particular case we have rules as written for How Characters can participate in Attacks declared. (Ranged or other wise, simply by exhausting if they are under your control and you declare an attack against an engaged enemy.)\n\nAnd then there's card text... Quick Strike.\n\nThe text here is either Over Riding RAW, creating an exeption or it's Not. IT could of course be expressed in more detail if it wants to override part of the ruls and not others, but that would require a more detailed text... something I think is lacking here...\n\nNow if you ask me, I think most of us read this card to mean \"Single Character Only\" to start with. Right? This we did since it said \"Single Character\" and \"it's attack\" etc... not that strange really... and if we apply that then we cannot use Ranged characters, or any other characters either for that matter.\n\nThen the FAQ came along and al of a sudden there was an example in there nullifying my original interpretation... in this example is was bleeding obvious that another character \"could join\"... granted he had the Ranged keyword but reading the example didn't make you feel like that was the focus of the example, neither was the Quick Strike card actually, but it appeared in a context where Declaring Attacks and Characters attacking out of turn etc was covered.\n\nOk... so I have to change how we play...\n\nBasically if a player is allowed to declare an attack via Card Text... then normal rules apply. And others can join in, as per normal rules.\n\nNow... this particular situation we have after \"Nate\" opened up... I don't know guys... I don't see it in the card text. Card Text is still pretty much exclusive and doesn't invite other characters to join in at all IMO. I'm leaning towards going back to my original interpretation because this half-this-half-that-because-some-dude-said-so-nonsense REALLY rubs me the wrong way.\n\nSorry for taking up your time with this.

As far as I can see, you might as well just resolve the original attack as per normal and save quick strike for dealing with an enemy when you are not in the combat phase.

I think that Legolas doesn't have to destroy the enemy, he only needs to have participated in the enemy being killed.\n\nSo if Legolas damages an enemy, and Thalin kills the same enemy straight after, then Legolas still gets his response.\n\nThe Blade of Gondolin is specific in saying that it works if the \"attached Hero attacks and destroys.\"\n\nWould anyone else agree with me here?\n\n \n\nIf so, would you consider Legolas' response to still work if he damaged an enemy in round 1, but Thalin killed that enemy in round 2? I think it should be on the same round, but nothing states this.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThey are the same thing. Legolas has to participate in the attack that kills the enemy. If Legolas damages the enemy and the enemy is later killed after that combat is over, you do not get to activate Legolas' response.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that you can only declare a single attack against any enemy on your turn, so if you controlled both Legolas and Thalin you cannot attack with Legolas then attack with Thalin after. You CAN attack the enemy with Legolas and Thalin at the same time, which is more beneficial to you anyways since you only count the defense once and not twice.\n\nIf you control Legolas and another player controls Thalin then you can just wait until the other play attacks with Thalin and join in with Legolas since he has the Ranged keyword. Again, this is more beneficial than declaring an attack with Legolas then the other player declaring an attack on the same enemy later with Thalin."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=551204","commentId":551204,"userName":"Mechanoise","timestamp":1320318018,"content":"Svenn said:\n\n \n\nAlso, keep in mind that you can only declare a single attack against any enemy on your turn, so if you controlled both Legolas and Thalin you cannot attack with Legolas then attack with Thalin after.

You CAN declare multiple attackers when attacking, in which case you combine their attack power against the enemy's defense. When declaring an attack you can declare as many attackers as you have eligible to participate. However, you can only declare a single attack against an enemy per turn.\n\nExamples:\n\nYou have Enemy 1 (defense value 2) and Enemy 2 engaged with you and you have Legolas and Thalin readied.\n\nYou CAN declare an attack against Enemy 1 with both Legolas and Thalin, combining their attack power (3 + 2 = 5) and subtracting the enemy's defense (5-2 = 3 damage).\nYou can NOT declare an attack against Enemy 1 with Legolas (3 attack power - 2 defense = 1 damage) and then AFTERWARDS declare another attack against Enemy 1 with Thalin (2 attack power - 2 defense = 0 damage).\nYou CAN declare an attack against Enemy 1 with Legolas.

Page 14 only grants actions between steps, not before them, like Stahlwolle pointed out before me.\n\nI've thought sometime about the sentence on p. 30, but if you take it literally, you're not allowed to do actions before committing characters. The sentence Silverhand77 also quoted reads \"Any player can take actions generally, or between the game steps stated in the rules.\"\nThis \"or\" has to be an exclusive or, and the \"take actions generally\" applies to the indented green \"Player actions\" bars, and the \"between the game steps\" applies to the non-indented green bars. (If it wouldn't be an exclusive or, the \"take actions generally\" would allow players to do actions before, while and after a game step, and the \"between...\" part would be totally superfluous.)\n\nSo I think Stahlwolle made a good catch, there's a rule missing, in my opinion. The sentence on p. 14 should read \"Players have the opportunity to take actions and play event cards before and at the end of each step\", as on some other pages in the book (Combat steps), too.

If\nthe players cannot fulfill the requirement of a location’s\ntravel effect, the players cannot travel to that location.\" (p. 23)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=552634","commentId":552634,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1320585077,"content":" \n\nSvenn said:\n\nIf the player could only take actions after a step resolved, why would we even need the chart?\n\n \n\nFor presenting a shorter overview, in addition to the rules texts from page 12 to page 22.\n\nSvenn said:\n\n \n\nNotice how some steps are red, with a green \"Player Actions\" section after them? That means you can't play anything during the step, but at the end of it you can. If that's what was intended, they would have done that here. They didn't though.\n\n \n\nAh, after I understood this, a light went on. Ok, that's a good point :-)  I thought the non-indented bars were green because they consist of several steps, and in between the players can play actions, and that's the sole reason for the non-indented ones being green. This is e.g. the case in the planning phase (play attachment /ally-> possible actions -> play next attachment -> actions -> ...) or with the green combat bars (choose enemy -> possible actions -> declare defender -> actions -> ...). But this is not everywhere the case, committing characters for a player only consists of a single thing. So I can deduce nothing out of intendation, I see that now... Yes, FFG would have made the \"commit\" step red and add another \"Player actions\" step if it should be treated like the \"Resolve questing\" and \"Player actions\" below.\n\n \n\nI also thought that the turn sequence on p. 30 is only a short version / overview of p. 12-22 and adds no information to it. This is also wrong, e.g. I can't find the player action window in resource phase on page 12...\n\nBut still I'm not quite happy... What's the meaning of indentation? Is the \"First player resolves attacks made by enemies against him\" bar, which contains many separate steps, considered as a single action window, just because it's green? What's the purpose of the \"or between the game steps\" without \"and before the first step\", if it is meant as \"between and before\"?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=552642","commentId":552642,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1320587276,"content":"Thanks Dam.  Painful.  sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]x2"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=552781","commentId":552781,"userName":"stahlwolle","timestamp":1320613655,"content":"Why an extra step for player actions after committing?\n\nIf I can play actions before and during committing, why does \"Gildor's Council\" has a explicit text to be played before committing?\n\nIs it also possible to play \"Sneak Attack\" to bring allies into play to quest?

Goblin Sniper: What if there the only enemies are 2 Goblin Snipers in the staging area?\n\n \n\n \n\nHi LEGA,\n\nsome of your question have been answered already, I'll try to anser the rest of them.\n\n1.) Yes, they're not reshuffled. If they would be reshuffled, the rulebook would instruct you to take note of your victory points per pencil or something like that.\n\n2.) Good question. Never thought of it before though, it seemed to be clear. I think the \"defending player\" is the player with whom the enemy is engaged. (The player which would be usually defending.) The rulebook only speaks about the \"active player\" on p. 18, so this is more a guess than a doubt-free statement, but I think in FAQ rule 1.04 the term \"defending player\" is used in the same sense as I said. And after all, the sentinel is just filling a place which should be filled by a character of the active player, so why should the \"defending player\" now change.\n\n4.) Due to the Golden Rule, the usual \"discard enemy when too much damage tokens are on it\" rule doesn't apply, but the wording of the card does. So it should be placed on top of the encounter deck after combat, in my opinion.\n\n5.) Right. Since the only restriction is that the target character has to be committed, also committed characters of other players can be chosen.\n\n6.) Since the effect of \"Driven by Shadow\" isn't restricted on attachments you control, I'd say FAQ rule 1.06 doesn't change anything, and encounter attachments are also valid targets.\n\n7.) Very good question. The correct answer depends on how duplicate cards are managed (are they regarded as the same card, but as another instance of the card? Or are copies regarded as different cards?) and what exactly the term \"other\" means (other cards or other instances?). Since I can't find anything about this in the rules, I'd just use common sense and because they're both titled with the same \"Goblin Sniper\" text, I'd guess that you can engange them.\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\nPete"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=554032","commentId":554032,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1320841899,"content":"HilariousPete said:\n\n4.)

It is already out of play. Effects cannot interact with a card out of play unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlso, check out this FAQ entry.\n\n\"(1.02) Simultaneous Effect Timing\nIf two or more conflicting effects would occur simultaneously, the first player decides the order in which the effects resolve.\n\nExample: Tom plays Sneak Attack (CORE 23) to put Beorn (CORE 31) into play during the combat phase. Sneak Effect has the condition, “At the end of the phase, if that ally is still in play, return it to your hand.” During combat, Tom uses Beorn’s triggered effect, which has the condition, “At the end of the phase in which you trigger this effect, shuffle Beorn back into your deck.” At the end of the phase, a situation arises in which two conflicting effects are attempting to resolve simultaneously on Beorn. The first player determines which of the two effects resolves first. (The second effect no longer applies when Beorn leaves play.)\"\n\nNotice how the second effect on Beorn no longer applies because Beorn is out of play? This is a similar situation, except Beorn is leaving play earlier.\n\nYou'll end up with a similar situation if you play Gandalf with Sneak Attack. Sneak Attack says to return Gandalf to your hand at the end of the phase and Gandalf's card says to discard him at the end of the round. After he returns to your hand from Sneak Attack, however, the discard effect can no longer apply because he is already out of play. You do not then discard Gandalf from your hand at the end of the round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=554070","commentId":554070,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1320847518,"content":"You've got a point in the \"no interactions from an out of play state\" and the leaving-Beorn example.

But this lasting effect is valid until the end of the current phase.\n\nOr take Eleanor. Suppose Surge is on the treachery card eleanor is used to cancel. Before the Surge resolves, the when revealed has to resolve (rules p. 24). But we have to use Eleanor's response even before the when revealed effect (otherwise, it wouldn't be of any use).

When playing Sneak Attack or For Gondor the original card that initiated the effect leaves play, but the effect of the cards is on a card that is already in play. Sneak attack specifies that the card played is returned to the owner's hand at the end of the phase. This effect targets the card being played, it does not target Sneak Attack. If you played an ally with Sneak Attack and it died it would go to the discard pile, then when Sneak Attack was supposed to return it to your hand it would fail because the target of the effect is out of play.\n\nEven in the case of Eleanor (which was errata'ed) the target of Surge or Doomed is not the Treachery card that was discarded.\n\nThere is a very important difference between the card initiating the effect and the target of an effect. If the target of an effect is not in play then it is not a valid target.\n\nRulebook about \"out of play\":\n\"Card effects do not interact with cards in an out of play state unless the effect specifically refers to that state.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=554092","commentId":554092,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1320850232,"content":"Svenn said:\n\n \n\nYour examples all have one thing in common... the target of the effect has not left play.\n\n \n\n \n\nBut when the Wolf Rider is flipped, and the shadow effect is resolved, it targets itself, and since it is in play, it also targets a card that is in play.

At the end of the round, neither Sneak Attack nor the ally are in play, but still FFG put the if clause on the card for this case, and this clause is preventing a destroyed character from being taken back into hand in ym opinion, and not the fact that the ally is out of play.\n\nSvenn said:\n\n \n\nEven in the case of Eleanor (which was errata'ed) the target of Surge or Doomed is not the Treachery card that was discarded.\n\nThere is a very important difference between the card initiating the effect and the target of an effect.

But in Eleanors case, the original target of eleanor's ability (the cancelled treachery card with the Surge keyword) is also in an out of play state when its Surge is applied.\n\n \n\nOr did you mean that this has been changed by the erratum? But I think not, the erratum only deals with the new treachery card, that it's revealed and not only replaced, but doesn't say anything about the old Surge...\n\nOr, if I misunderstood you and you wanted to say that Surge or Doomed don't target the Treachery card... yes, but this is the case everytime a Surge occurs...\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=554103","commentId":554103,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1320851367,"content":"Yes, Wolf Riders is in play when the effect is initiated but when the resolution of the effect occurs the card is already out of play.

But after your and radiskull's AGoT-inspired answers, I suppose FFG wants event+treachery cards also to be discarded just after they're played, and only their effects staying active. This would favour no re-evaluating of the card effect, because re-evaluating a card which is already out of play seems a bit strange to me, so I think your answer \"the 2nd location doesn't get +1 WS\" is still valid\n\n4) You and radiskull agree, so no problem here ;-)\n\n5) You don't agree with radiskull, but if I got his line of argueing right (see my response below), I think I want to agree with him.\n\n \n\nradiskull said:\n\n(For my remaining answers, I'm borrowing a bit from my AGoT knowledge - I know they're not the same, but I imagine the answers and the justifications for them will be similar.)\n\n\n\nYes, that's exaclty what I'm looking for.\n\nradiskull said:\n\n1- I just answered this one above; I think First Player chooses.\n\n2 - Treachery and Event cards are discarded as soon as they're played.  Usually they create effects that are lasting (\"until the end of the round\", for example), but that lasting effect doesn't require that the card be in play.  I think the comparison to Dunedain Mark, an attachment, is not the best comparison.  Attachments are active as long as they are attached.  Events are active for as long as they say they are.  There's no need for them to remain in play for their effects to occur.

Transforms the ordering problem to a timing problem. Of course the wording of LotR FAQ rule  1.02 will have to be altered to also include non-conflicting simultaneous effect timing for this. But I guess this is just a matter of time until FFG does this, since there will come up more of these questions where 2 things happen at the same time and they're not really conflicting, but will have different results... Take e.g. MADG0BLIN's question.\n\n2) Ok, good to know the AGoT way of dealing with this. So card effects can exist without their originial card being in play... I'll stick with my initial way then.\n\n5) I just downloaded the AGoT FAQ. I'm refering to the timing structure on p. 15 on the lower left. So your point is that Landroval's response can be triggered and resolved in step number 5, and the check wether a player is eliminated only appears after the complete handling of the current action (step number 6), yes?\n\nThat would again mean that the rescued hero loses his attachments and resource tokens (I think this would happen in step 3 as part of the action resolution), correct?\n\nWow, I just discovered the flow charts of the timing structure on p. 18,  really nice :-)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=569381","commentId":569381,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1324307341,"content":"radiskull said:\n\n5 - I do believe that Landroval CAN prevent a player from being eliminated - you have to view Responses as part of the resolution of any player action or game action.  By the time that action has fully resolved (responses and all), the player still has a hero in the game.  (I could be wrong about this one, but I do think that you have to allow for Responses to occur before checking to see if a player is eliminated.)\n\n\n\nThat makes of course sense, technically.

Put one damage token on that hero. (Limit once per game.)\"  I also think that Landroval would be worded as a \"save\" effect, but that's neither here nor there.)\n\nSo far, the only major rules difference I've seen between this game and AGoT are regarding attachments. (In AGoT, A Burning Brand would be discarded if the attached character lost the Lore icon, and playing an attachment on an opponents character does not grant them control of it.)  I'm inclined to think that when it comes to timing, AGoT is a good guide for us."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=569556","commentId":569556,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1324342805,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\n \n\n \n\nThat makes of course sense, technically.

Put one damage token on that hero. (Limit once per game.)\"\n\nSo far, the only major rules difference I've seen between this game and AGoT are regarding attachments. (In AGoT, A Burning Brand would be discarded if the attached character lost the Lore icon, and playing an attachment on an opponents character does not grant them control of it.)  I'm inclined to think that when it comes to timing, AGoT is a good guide for us.\n\n \n\n \n\nI like your version much better than the real card ;-) First, it's \"if a hero would be destroyed\" and not \"after\", which was the word that started me to think that Landroval can't be used to save the last hero. And second, it specifies on losing attachments and tokens.\n\nPerhaps around/after Christmas I'll have some time to look at the timing structure of AGoT more detailed. As you said, I guess before a timing structure for LotR is published, this will serve as a fine replacement.\n\nBut while skimming through AGoT FAQ, I found another difference to LotR, next to the attachment requirements you mentioned: targets. A target requires the word \"choose\" to really be a target in AGoT ( FAQ p. 12). The usage of targets on LotR's \"Dry Watercourse\" seems different, when considering the wording of \"Gollum's Bite\"...\n\n \n\nzeb said:\n\n \n\nNate has made an official ruling according to this thread on BGG:\n\nHello,\n\nGood question!\n\nOnce a player is eliminated, his discard pile can no longer interact\nwith the game.

If a location in the staging area has enough progress tokens on it (from the Northern tracker for instance), is it immediately removed from play, or does it still have to be made an active location, before it is removed?\n> \n> It is removed from play as soon as it has enough tokens on it. Any suplus go onto the quest as normal.\n\nEdit: Remove last sentence. Surplus tokens from locations in Staging Area do not go onto the quest card.\n\n> 22. What does \"eligible enemy target\" mean on the Quick Strike card?\n> \n> Eligible means \"If it was the Combat Phase and you could normally declare that character as an attacker against that enemy.\" That would mean only Dunhere can attack Enemies in Staging and Ranged characters could attack Enemies engaged with other players. Other characters would have to attack Enemies engaged with you. (Thanks to Apophenia for this concisely worded answer)\n\n\nEdit: Rewrite first sentence as \"Eligible enemy targets are those your characters could normally attack (declare as targets) during the Combat Phase.

Snow Wargs, for instance, deal damage to decleared defender when they attack, thus their effect has to apply at step 2. I would say \"When X attacks\" applies as early as possible during the Enemy attack sequence."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45639-unoffical-faq-and-suggested-answers-thread/?do=findComment&comment=652678","commentId":652678,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1341221133,"content":"zeb said:\n\nI would say \"When X attacks\" applies as early as possible during the Enemy attack sequence.\n\n\n\nYes.

And then the Official FAQ text kicks in and they are placed back into the staging area. Then if any trolls are present they get attached to a troll."}]}
