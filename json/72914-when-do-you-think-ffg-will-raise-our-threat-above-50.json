I was just wondering when, and why, you think FFG might introduce this rule.\n\nI suppose one obvious idea is that they might eventually allow us to have more than 3 heroes in our party. And then i was thinking of these new battleground ideas that they've started talking about in the next cycle… do you think they will introduce it then? If it's going to be a big battle, then it makes sense for us to have bigger parties. How can we have an epic battle with only 3 characters? They should let us double our numbers, and have the battle go on for ages, all the way up to 100. Little enemy cards can then chip away at the locations adding 1 and 2s, and bigger enemy cards (war machines?) can come in and do massive damage to the locations, maybe a whole 5 or 10 at once."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72914-when-do-you-think-ffg-will-raise-our-threat-above-50/?do=findComment&comment=711046","commentId":711046,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1350483769,"content":"i think just about the same you - in the more epic battles.\n\nhowever on a different note, perhaps threat will go over 50 for a themeatic reason- ie when we enter morder, or walk outside the gates of minas morgul…\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72914-when-do-you-think-ffg-will-raise-our-threat-above-50/?do=findComment&comment=711087","commentId":711087,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1350486964,"content":" If the threat is raised beyond 50 i think it will only be as part of the game mechanics for a specific quest…kind of like rich's thematic reasoning.  I personally would be surprised if they allowed 4 heroes per deck…i figure thats the point of doing multiplayer if you want more epic battles with more heroes"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72914-when-do-you-think-ffg-will-raise-our-threat-above-50/?do=findComment&comment=711189","commentId":711189,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1350496178,"content":"richsabre said:\n\ni think just about the same you - in the more epic battles.\n\nhowever on a different note, perhaps threat will go over 50 for a themeatic reason- ie when we enter morder, or walk outside the gates of minas morgul…\n\nrich\n\n\n\n \n\nYou just gave me an idea…\n\n \n\n*back to the drawing board*"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72914-when-do-you-think-ffg-will-raise-our-threat-above-50/?do=findComment&comment=711525","commentId":711525,"userName":"Cunir","timestamp":1350554564,"content":"i was thinking they might do the battlegrounds the same way they did Foundations of Stone… with each bit of your party stranded in a different battleground (with its own staging area). then maybe we'll have to fight out way out to join up with the rest of our party"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72914-when-do-you-think-ffg-will-raise-our-threat-above-50/?do=findComment&comment=711652","commentId":711652,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1350566462,"content":"Cunir said:\n\ni was thinking they might do the battlegrounds the same way they did Foundations of Stone… with each bit of your party stranded in a different battleground (with its own staging area). then maybe we'll have to fight out way out to join up with the rest of our party\n\n\n\n \n\n\"Like\"  +1"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72914-when-do-you-think-ffg-will-raise-our-threat-above-50/?do=findComment&comment=711665","commentId":711665,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1350567663,"content":"Cunir said:\n\n \n\ni was thinking they might do the battlegrounds the same way they did Foundations of Stone… with each bit of your party stranded in a different battleground (with its own staging area). then maybe we'll have to fight out way out to join up with the rest of our party\n\n \n\n \n\nmight be a little dull for solo players..perhaps with a tweak or two"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72914-when-do-you-think-ffg-will-raise-our-threat-above-50/?do=findComment&comment=711730","commentId":711730,"userName":"Cunir","timestamp":1350574655,"content":"ive just thought… if they increase the threat to 100 then that actually makes it less of a threat, which is a bit weird. because we have more time to win. if they really wanted to increase \"threat\" then they should reduce our threat to below 50"}]}
