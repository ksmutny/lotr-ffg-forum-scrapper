Ideally, we would see this thing by the end of the year, but based on what we've seen so far, who knows? Anyway what do you think it will/should be? I'll kick it off:\n\n \n\nI'd love to see The Mines of Moria Expansion. It would probably have a set of three quests: (Watcher in the Water, Balin's Tomb, Bridge of Khazad-Dum) and obviously a bunch of new player cards. It would be a really good opportunity to give some Dwarven love, as we've already started to see a lot of Gondor/Rohan kind of stuff. And the idea of adventuring around in the dark depths of Moria with your friends has got to be pretty appealing, right?\n\n \n\nSo what's on your wishlist for the first Big Box?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51243-the-first-big-box-expansion-an-exercise-in-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=511705","commentId":511705,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1312894319,"content":"I agree the theme of Moria would be cool with a definite Dwarf feel but it wouldn't be about the tomb of balin but more about Balin moving into the mines and finding Mithril before the Goblins come.

It would probably remain within the timing parameters set by the core set, would allow the designer to explore a new direction (less \"outside / wilds\" cards, more \"underdark\" stuff) and help build the dwarven armies (they're my favorite \"theme\" from all the player cards for now).\n\nWhat I'm curious about is whether or not encounter cards from this big box expansion (if it includes encounter cards and not just player cards) will be compatible with subsequent adventure packs (rather than always using a single adventure pack with one or two encounter sub-decks form the core set). The core set encounters become redundant after a while.\n\nIf a thematic was to be developed around the Lonely Mountain, it probably wouldn't deal with the Battle of Five Armies (again, because of the timing parameters established; they may change later, but I don't think it'll be the case for at least 2 years, if not more), but instead around Sauron's emissaries and the forces he sent toward that region.\n\nAnother theme they could eventualy work no would be the pirates from the south.

While obviously, there will always be some cards that make it into every deck (Northern Tracker, Galdhrim's Greeting etc), I'm already finding after just the first two adventure packs that some decks work better for certain quests than others. So I think it makes sense to increase the encounter card pool at the same rate as the player card pool. You get new player cards that may make older quests easier to beat, but now you have a whole new challenge to build decks around. So I think that as long as the encounter card pool increases at the same rate as the player card pool, the possibilities are pretty much endless.\n\nThat being said though...this is the first cooperative LCG. Ever. So it's really tough to say \"Thing X will work\" while \"Thing Y will not work. It seems that they're being very experimental all of this, which is (for me) a really neat thing. Not only are we discovering deckbuilding and playing challenges, but we're seeing the actual mechanics of the game take shape.\n\nSorry, this got kind of off topic..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51243-the-first-big-box-expansion-an-exercise-in-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=511962","commentId":511962,"userName":"player582283","timestamp":1312922518,"content":"The Moria and Protect the Shire storylines are great, and I bet we see them.  However, one that I would really like to see explored is one where we go up against the Haradrim.  It was a LotR theme that I always would have liked to see developed further. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51243-the-first-big-box-expansion-an-exercise-in-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=511963","commentId":511963,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1312922731,"content":"No worries, good analysis!\n\nTo get back \"on\" topic: MORE ELVES!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51243-the-first-big-box-expansion-an-exercise-in-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=512011","commentId":512011,"userName":"TheGrue","timestamp":1312928740,"content":" I was kind of surprised to see this thread because I figured since there are adventure packs coming out every month, why would you need to even release a big box expansion?  They could continuously pump out new quests, heroes, cards, etc.  What else would they really be able to add?  Have they done this with another LCG?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51243-the-first-big-box-expansion-an-exercise-in-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=512013","commentId":512013,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1312929108,"content":"TheGrue said:\n\n \n\n I was kind of surprised to see this thread because I figured since there are adventure packs coming out every month, why would you need to even release a big box expansion?  They could continuously pump out new quests, heroes, cards, etc.  What else would they really be able to add?  Have they done this with another LCG?\n\n \n\n \n\nAGoTLCG\n\n@ Narsil\n\nYES!!!

I see it having a number of dwarven heros including Balin of course, 3 or 4 quests of difficultys 4,6,8,9 and 4-5 encounter sets to populate those quests. As for player cards minimum 15 cards per faction i.e. lore with ideally twice that number so totalling 120 new player cards.\n\nMy fear however is the issue surrounding the encounter sets, as we move forward past the first 6 packs (one cycle) we will have 10+ encounter sets BUT and thats a BIG but, all new quests will STILL only be able to make use of the coreset 4 encounter sets as these are the only ones the designers can garuntee the player owns.\n\nNow this can be ignored by fan made quests which have been amazing so far and can only get better as more cards are available to quest designers like ninjadorg. But the creators of the game are limited to CORE + 1 expansion each quest. Now they COULD require BIGBOX 1 to use cycle 2 lets say bigbox MORIA and cycle 2: Rumbles in the deep, however this would drop sales as those who do not or could not buy the MORIA set would be left with no new quests (the player cards would still be viable).\n\nAs a workaround cycle 2 quests could contain quests that have encounter set requirements such as : sauron eye,orcs,gollum,moria depths. OR sauron eye,orcs, tower, anduin.  I.E. they provide an desirable encounter set mix and a if you only have coreset mix.\n\nI dont know what license agreement FFG have with the tolkien estate but i could forsee it being justifiable to include the watcher and balrog in the pre LOTR book timeframe however the tolkien estate might disagree and consider those as being artifacts of that work. As for quests set within the LOTR book timeframe these would be GREAT but i dont think it falls within the current agreement, but i hope i am wrong.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51243-the-first-big-box-expansion-an-exercise-in-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=512169","commentId":512169,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1312962906,"content":"SiCK_Boy said:\n\nRegarding the card pool, how big do we really want it to become for players?\n\n\n\nTwo adventure packs in, we see 19 cards per sphere.

Why in the world would Eowyn be venturing into Mirkwood at this point in the Tolkien timeline? Based on what we've already seen, FFG definitely seems to have some leeway with content, so I would not be surprised if we see things from LOTR in this game.\n\nRE: Encounter Sets\n\nThis is a very interesting point, that I hope they've found the simple solution too (someone above already mentioned it). Have new 'based' encounter sets, just with a Core Set equivalent. Although if you think about it, there's no reason that a potential Moria Box Set wouldn't be self contained anyway.
