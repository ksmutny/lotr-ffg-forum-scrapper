It's fairly obvious that taking the objective card at the last moment is important in beating the last scenario, and destroying the Nazgul is far from simple. There are no Tactics or Spirit cards (the two spheres that you were playing) that make it so.

But if you actually want to beat it the issue is your threat is going to be far too high, and come turn 2 you'll have to face the Troll, who will rocket up your threat. Now, if you get really lucky Gimli can take the hit first turn and then you can turn around and get rid of him turn 2, but if his shadow card gives him even 1 more axe Gimli's dead and your game is shot.\n\nI've found the easiest way to deal with this scenario (without resorting to blind luck) is to play a mostly spirit deck with very low threat. My current Spirit/Leadership deck starts out at 25, buying me plenty of time before I have to face the Troll, and half the time I'll play a Galadrim's Greeting to buy myself even more time. This can allow me to set up a Sneak/Gandalf combo or something similar and take him out with no problem.\n\nKnowledge can also do it, as they have access to Forest Snares, but you'd have to splash something else (probably Leadership!) to give you some attacking power. Denethor/Berevor/Theodred will give you 26 threat, which buys you a few turns...but you also lack access to Spirit's powerful threat reduction."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461400","commentId":461400,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1304159835,"content":"Also if you have 2 core sets play with your friends competitive.Play the same scenario solo and then compare your score.Wen you play your turn your friend watches you for a fair play  and then you do tha same in his turn.\n\nI think this will keep your interest for some time and it will force you to make better decks for better scoregui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=461405","commentId":461405,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1304160475,"content":"ffgfan said:\n\n \n\nFirst of all I thought it will be more challenging to beat all scenarios - I beat all tree in a row after the first play.

When I got the core set for W:I I had a lot more fun with it. And about LOTR LCG core set - I got bored after a couple of plays. The only thing why I still tried it was wthe fact that my firend wanted to try it.\n\nOh, there's no more thing I don't like - the massive part of the game is luck. When You are lucky enought for the first two rounds You could draw in the encounter only treachery or location cards and that gives You a lot of advantage.\n\nThe way I see it  - The game is good but I like a lot better Invasion from this one. Becouse here the luck play a large part of the game.\n\nBut that's only my opinion after more then a week of playtesting it.\n\nI will say it like this - I will put this game on my shelf and the game will wait for better times I hope. And by better time I mean after the first cycle of Adventure pack I will think if I want to play it more.\n\n@Calexander - anwsers: yes, yes, yes, yes. And it's not that I don't like it only becouse I beat it in first play but the main reason is the part that luck play in it. I think that one of the reasons why i beat the game in first play was the fact that I got very lucky. For example - in the second scenarion on Anduin in two first rounds I got in the encounter one treachery and after it one location. So I got time to kill the hill troll. Or in the third when I escaped from Dol Guldur the shadow cards on objective cards were treachery, location and only one enemy. So the main reason why I'm disapointed with this game is the large part of luck in play.\n\n@Mestrahd - that's one of the main rules of the game, You can not miss that. Don't You think?\n\n@Conykchameleon - 1) I know that and that one of the main rule, can't miss that. I use Eowin to play cards like Gandalf or from Spirit sphere. 2) and yes.\n\nSo sorry but I'm leaveng the community of this game.\n\nMaybe such a cooperative game like this is not the kind I want to play. This kind of cooperative game is not for me becouse I don't have to much fun playing it.

Sorry, but I cannot believe such an outrageous claim without some solid particulars. He says he had a couple of rounds to wait on the troll. But the heroes he mentions have a combined threat of 29. You don't have a couple of rounds before the troll engages. One, at best. You could use The Galadhrin's Greeting to reduce threat, but that's a 3 cost card. With only Eowyn and no resource engine on this deck, that is impossible, Gandalf is even more expensive and can't be played right away because Sneak Attack doesn't fit in the deck. How are you preventing the troll from engaging? Not only that, it is very difficult to muster the attack power to kill the troll, again without a resource battery. Maybe you can use Feints and Gondorian Spearman to hold off and on another round damage the troll. But how many cards can you play in a couple of turns? And quest? And kill the troll quickly?\n\nPersonally, it sounds like he skipped something important and won't admit to it from embarrassment. And now, he is leaving the game because it is \"too easy\".

Firstly I think its worth pointing out that even though the game's solo play is a great selling point the fact that its so easy to get others to join in (just give them a deck and scale up the encounters) and since the quests (especially the 3rd) in the box are designed to work better in multiplayer there will always be a very strong multiplayer following.\nOn top of that I dont think that easier play experiences are necisarily a bad thing, for instance there was a player on the forums a few days ago who plays with the house rule of the Questing phase being optional. This dramatically reduces the difficulty of the game but hes having a ball with it regardless! I think there will be very few people who will honestly drop the game because they missread a rule, the same could be sad for any game at the end of the day."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=462188","commentId":462188,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1304320379,"content":"I kept forgetting the raise threat by 1 as well every few rounds but usually caught myself by the end of the next round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=462217","commentId":462217,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1304323549,"content":"Entropy42 said:\n\nPersonally, I'm disappointed with the amount of luck in this game, and I really disagree that luck is a greater factor in W:I.  In this game, getting a string of non-effectual treachery cards can hand you the game.  Getting nothing but locations will usually make you lose if you aren't playing Northern Tracker (conversely the game is very easy if this happens and you are).  Getting Caught in the Web during setup or turn 1 of the 3rd scenario is pretty much game over, etc.\n\nThe thing I've always liked about card games (vs dice rolling) is while there is always a random element, at least if you get screwed/lucky with card draw, you know that card won't be coming up again.  In dice randomness, you can just roll low all game and lose regardless of how good/bad your strategy is.  This game is the same way.  If all the hard locations/enemies/treacheries come up as shadow cards, you got the card out of the way and you didn't even have to suffer its effect.  Basically the difficulty is a very wide range just based on what you draw.  Hopefully this will be mitigated somehow with future cards, but it seems to me that its more like a core part of the game. \n\nThe second thing that is disappointing is the way they scaled difficulty for multiplayer.  To me, its baffling.  Why make a card like the 2nd step of the 2nd scenario. \"reveal 1 additional card each quest phase\"  Why wouldn't that be \"reveal 1 additional card PER PLAYER each quest phase\"?  That makes the game roughly twice as hard in solo play, buy only 25% harder in a 4 player game.  I played two 4 player games this weekend, both times I was teaching 2 new players and playing with only the stock decks.  We absolutely stomped the 1st scenario in 4 turns in the first game, and beat the 2nd scenario with a combined score of 100.  No one's hero had damage at the end of the game, and we had about 10 allies in play. \n\nYes, this is easily fixed.  I can just make house rules that the quest cards all scale linearly based on the # of players.  I just don't understand why this wasn't done to begin with.  The power of the party scales linearly with # of players, and maybe even slightly better than that (I would say 2 players are more than twice as powerful as a single player).\n\n\n\nI agree. As things are right now, the game has some serious scalability issues. It makes me wonder how the playtesting was done. Did they only ever try it with two players?\n\nI think they'll have to revise a couple of rules to turn this into a game that works well no matter how many players there are. More careful quest design will help somewhat, but I don't believe it can fix all of the inherent issues (like  the surge mechanism)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46031-disapointed-with-this/?do=findComment&comment=462238","commentId":462238,"userName":"Carnivean","timestamp":1304325363,"content":"We are trying a few differemt things to toughen it up a little:\n\n1.
