I always raise my threat by 3, as I don't see how else to play it, but it seems brutally unfair when you haven't even gotten a chance to go questing yet. Maybe it needs an errata to specify that it shouldn't apply during set up conditions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46732-pursued-by-shadow-before-questing/?do=findComment&comment=467950","commentId":467950,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1305282412,"content":"Official FAQ will probably answer this, but to be honest this is fair.\n\nYou do not have to deal with any location nor any enemy , you just raise threat by 3."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46732-pursued-by-shadow-before-questing/?do=findComment&comment=467952","commentId":467952,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1305282734,"content":"I know what you mean - you build everything up for the confrontation with the troll in the second or third turn and suddenly you must deal with him in the first round.
