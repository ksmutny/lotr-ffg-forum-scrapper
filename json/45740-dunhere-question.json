You are right that the \"when so\" is applied to the most recent condition, but the previous sentence only contains a single condition.\n\nAs others have already stated, they are only a single effect, \"Dúnhere can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone\"\n\nDunhere cannot attack enemies in the staging area unless he attacks alone, and therefore there are not two conditions only one. He never has an opportunity to attack enemies in the staging area with other people. Just because he can attack alone enemies that are not in the staging area, you cannot extrapolate that the +1 applies to all instances of him attacking alone, because the sentence isnt constructed in a way that supports that theory."}]}
