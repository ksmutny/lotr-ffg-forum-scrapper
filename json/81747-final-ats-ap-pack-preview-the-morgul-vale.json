Just the other day I remembered when Asfaloth came out, they mentioned he is the first mount, and then… there was a long break. Now I am thinking if there shall be a card that searches for Mounts?\n\nI too first thought of Boromir when seeing Théoden, the two \"tragic\" heroes can really be powerful I feel. It also makes sense we are probably not going to see an overall Rohan boost (like Dain's) since there is Mutual Accord which makes Gondor Rohan (and vice versa). On the other hand, there is an overall Gondor boost already, though much less global and/or potent than for the Dwarves. I see this paragraph is not much good but I am excited about Rohan and Gondor synergies. Gondor seems to be the trait that binds things together quite a bit, Gondor and Outlands (given - Hunter of Lamedon, for now), Gondor and Dúnedain (Blood of Gondor, for now), Gondor and Rohan (Mutual Accord or the previewed Steed).\n\nWhat I think shall be toughest in making a mono-sphere Tactics deck (for solo) is threat reduction now. With Théoden, Willpower can be managed but since there are now low-threat Tactics heroes, this may be an issue…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81747-final-ats-ap-pack-preview-the-morgul-vale/?do=findComment&comment=780503","commentId":780503,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1364904143,"content":"Theoden looks awesome.

Nazgul is cool!!!!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYeah, the Nazgul looks nasty.  Tough stats, takes at least 5 turns to kill,  and engagement threshold is only at 1.  Obviously, there will be something in the deck itself (on the quest or location cards) that will help deal with him, or he is simply too nasty.  And destroys what little attempt at Secrecy you could hope for.  But I like that they are making him super-hard to deal with.  Just waiting to see what twists the deck will throw at us for handling him!\n\n \n\nI was underwhelmed at Theoden at first.  He just feels pretty limited.  With those stats, that seems odd to say, I know.  I don't mind the 12 threat to start with, and his great stats reflect the steep cost… no complaints there.  I would just rather have a hero I can be more versatile with… he is pretty much guaranteed to be assigned to an all-Tactics hero lineup.  But it's really a small complaint… not every hero can fit every deck.\n\nA couple ideas of heroes to pair with him… (don't have access to my cards right now, so just pulling some out of my head):\n\nTheoden - Gimli - Brand (33 threat):  For sheer bang for your buck in terms of Theoden's boost ability.  3 Tactics heroes that could quest for 3 willpower a piece… dang.  Not much synergy between them beyond that, although would be a decent multiplayer lineup (epecially if you could get sentinel on Gimli), particularly if you could get another player to do some serious threat reduction for you (that is going to be a theme for any deck with Theoden, I imagine).\n\nTheoden - Boromir - Glorfindel (spirit) (28 threat) - Now THIS lineup I would be interested in trying myself!  The obvious detraction is that in adding a non-tactic hero, you lessen Theoden's effect.  But a constant boost to himself and Bormir is still pretty **** good, and Glorfindel adds in that synergy piece of bringing in the threat-reduction blue cards, as well as the readying cards (UC, new mount… not that impressed with mount) that will free Boromir and Theoden to just be three-hormed beasts- quest, defend, or attack!  Oh, and Glorfindel is alright at questing and defending as well…. lol.  And his lower starting threat really helps offset the higher cost of the other two.\n\nTheoden - Thalin - Dain (33 threat) - I thought first pairing him with Thalin would help keep the starting threat down a little, but dropping Dain in with them kinda killed that idea.  I only threw this one together for the thought of finally making it worth questing Thalin every turn regardless.  With both Theoden and Dain's boosts in effect, Thalin quests for 3 (and wounds all the revealed enemies).  Having Dain in there allows for SoG, that will help pay for all the spendy red and purple cards this deck would surely have in it…  would still have to do some fancy footwork to deal with the higher threat, of course, but with Dain in, the \"Sneak Attack+Gandalf\" combo becomes an automatic…  And of course, there's all the nice dwarven cards to play off the two heroes…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81747-final-ats-ap-pack-preview-the-morgul-vale/?do=findComment&comment=780614","commentId":780614,"userName":"Colino","timestamp":1364923967,"content":"Captain Poe said:\n\nDoes Theoden boosth is own willpower up to 3?\n\n\n\nYes he does, this is also interesting because they obviously took it into account when deciding his threat cost of 12.

Maybe because i feel that boosting traits should be done by those who are at the top of their herarchy:\n\n- Dain (could have been THorin) after the Hobbit becomes the King of Dúrin's folk; so his ability (despite been too strong) isn't bad planned;\n\n- Boromir (could have been Aragorn) was the Gondor great hope at the begining of the Lord of the Rings; so the Leadership Boromir ability is in one of the right Tolkien characters;\n\n- to Rohan, who is left to give this kind of boosting?\n\n \n\n \n\nAs to the Steed of the Mark and the other Mount card, Asfaloth:\n\nWhitout any other cards to give the traits or the sphere and the Against the Shadow cycle cards:\n\n- we have only 3 heroes that can play the Steed on themselves (Dunhere, Eowyn and Eleanor);\n\n- we have only 2 heroes that can play Asfaloth on themselves (Elrond and Lore Glorfindel);\n\n \n\nCan be played yet on the following, but needs a spirit hero on the team or Song of Travel (for Steed) or Song of Wisdom (for Asfaloth) or Narvi's Belt: \n\n- Steed of the Mark can only be played on 7 other heroes (Beregond, both Boromir, Denethor, Prince Imrahil, Háma and Theodred);\n\n- Asfaloth can only be played on 4 other heroes (Legolas, Elladan, Elrohir and Spirit Glorfindel);\n\n \n\nThe Steed ability is the same as the Core Aragorn's one.\n\nBut given the heroes where he can be played we have some of those heroes:\n\nthat are only designed to, on normal quests, do one thing (Eowyn - quest, Háma - attack, Beregond - defend). the last two are usually not worthy of having on quest because they have low (1) or no willpower and are not the prime candidates to give willpower boosts.\n\ncan do more than one thing. On these:\n\n- Denethor usually uses his ability before questing, so doesn't have much benefict from the Steed ability;\n\n- Theodred gives an simultaneous effect with the one from the Steed, so basically he would be questing and readying himself for 0 (it is better the UC);\n\n- Tactics Boromir already have that ability with a different cost (threat rise)\n\n- Leadership Boromir needs to have at least one resource to have his ability, so we could have a bit of problem with resources;\n\n- Eleanor usefull but resource needed;\n\n \n\nAs to Asfaloth:\n\nhis ability is unique on heroes and has a boost if it rider is Glorfindel.\n\n \n\nI love that they explore the traits… And that it integrates well with the other existing cards. But Steed of the Mark seems way too powerfull, in comparison to Asfaloth…\n\n \n\nA bit like Dain in comparison with Leadership Boromir…\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYou are forgetting about Battle and Siege keywords.

Action: Exaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to attached hero's resource pool.\"\n\nMaybe you meant short of using either of these two cards, there are only 3 heroes?\n\n\n\nWhen I wrote:\n\n\"Whitout any other cards to give the traits or the sphere and the Against the Shadow cycle cards:\"\n\nI was trying to analise the use of those two cards without the need to have to use any other cards to give traits or spheres. Or the Against the Shadow cards that we do not know fully yet…\n\n \n\nSo yes, I meant that short of using these cards (Nor Am I A Stranger and Steward of Gondor, plus Mutual Accord) there are only 3 heroes that can play Steed of the Mark on themselfs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81747-final-ats-ap-pack-preview-the-morgul-vale/?do=findComment&comment=780893","commentId":780893,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1364988365,"content":"gatharion said:\n\nbenhanses said:\n\n \n\nYeah, the Nazgul looks nasty.  Tough stats, takes at least 5 turns to kill,  and engagement threshold is only at 1.  \n\n \n\nNot technically true.\n\nI think the way Dwarrowdelf Axe is worded, that it would do another damage to the Nazgul, if it was being used in the attack.

That would at least buff Theodred and Eowyn and synergies with their abilities--and it would be a lot more thematic. \n \nI think the designers were trying a little too hard here to shoehorn in the mono-sphere theme of the cycle into this characters ability. I mean, they could have AT LEAST worded it like Burning Brand so we could use Song of Battle.\n \nNow watch as they release \"Theoden's Pony\" and give him Dunhere's ability or \"Theoden's Banner\" that extends his buff to Rohan allies.

I agree 100% that Theoden needs some attachment love along the same lines as some of our Dwarrodelf heroes (Vilea, Light of Valinor, Asfaloth, Sword that Was Broken, Celabrian Stone) but disagree completely with your reasoning.\n\n \n\nI think Steed of the Mark is GREAT. For a cost of 1 Spirit Resource you are essentially giving any Rohan or Gondor character (and remember, SoG grants the Gondor trait) Aragorn’s ability. Suddenly any resource-gain related ability (Gloin, Bifur, Theodred) becomes even more powerful. Wealth of Gondor? Now a readying effect. Hell, in a 4-player game I would even consider running Nor am I a Stranger w/ this. Is it as bat-crap amazing as UC? No. Nor is it as useful as the dirt cheap Cram—but it’s a reliable, predictable effect that can be used to great affect once you get some resource generation on the table.\n\n \n\nTheoden, on the other hand, REALLY needs something to boost his value. I’ve gone over that already in this thread so I won’t repeat myself too much but he needs SOMETHING to make him worth his 1 greater threat cost vs stats (and yes, I know that his ability bounces him up to 12 but Bard has an effective stat cost of 13 most of the time, Elladan and Elrohir both have effective stat cost of 11, Dunhere, Eowyn—they all have slightly more situational abilities but in practice you are using them for their strengths).\n\n \n\nAll in all, I have to say I am not SUPER excited for this cycle. Think that’s just because I play most of my games 2-player, though. The focus on mono-sphere construction (and the liberal use of the “printed” modifier) means I would be locked out of 2 spheres for most of my games. Still, you never know—this could become my favorite cycle! I certainly love the narrative.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81747-final-ats-ap-pack-preview-the-morgul-vale/?do=findComment&comment=781487","commentId":781487,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1365111426,"content":"So, this isn't related to Theoden at all, but it looks like we're going to get more reliable event recycling cards in this cycle.

I figured out what you meant. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] As for Steed of the Mark—I think we may have to agree to disagree on that one but I will lay out my reasoning and some of the factors behind it.\n\n \n\nFirst of all, and maybe most importantly, I only have one Core set (and all the adventure packs/deluxe expansions, plus 2 single SoGs that I was able to find on ebay). That means that while UC is an auto-include in every Spirit deck I make, I only have ONE of them. So I may have a somewhat healthier appreciation for ANY readying effect than most.\n\n \n\nSecondly, I almost always include some kind of resource acceleration in my decks. This card gives those cards (like Horn of Gondor, Steward of Gondor, Wealth of Gondor) more flexibility. I can decide based on what’s on the table and in my hand if I would rather have a free quester that turn or the resource. To be clear, I don’t see this as Light of Valinor—I’m not using it every turn. But it’s a RELIABLE readying engine on the table that I can make use of when I don’t have a Cram or a Miruvor in hand. Hell—worst case scenario I use it a couple times and then it can become a shield for “discard attachment” treacheries.\n\n \n\nAnd remember—it doesn’t have to go on my heroes. In a multiplayer game if another player is doing well on resources or has SoG out then I might throw it over to his side to power through the Quest deck. You’re probably looking at 6-12 progress for 3 resources over 3 rounds—not that much w/ Steward (which is the natural pairing here as it also grants the Gondor trait). Not that I would want to do that in EVERY quest (a lot of times there are better uses for the resources), but again—flexibility.\n\n \n\nSo yeah—reasoning. I can totally see where you’re coming from and it’s true that compared to UC this card is crap—but you aren’t running it INSTEAD of UC. I will say though that as much as I do still like the card a lot I will have to downgrade my “GREAT” to a “great” as I forgot about Miruvor (which if I had to choose, I like more for its different flavor of flexibility). Still, we WILL get a fetch card for the “mount” keyword (either in this cycle or in a future Rohan Deluxe Expansion) so I may bump it back up to “GREAT” yet. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81747-final-ats-ap-pack-preview-the-morgul-vale/?do=findComment&comment=781707","commentId":781707,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1365161712,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\nJonofPDX said:\n\n \n\nlleimmoen said:\n\n \n\nStyle75 said:\n\n \n\nI still find it wierd that they would preview a spirit sphere card (the Steed) in an article about tactics monosphere decks.

His ability is a major help at the start of the game where tactics suffers the most questwise. Later you can add enough allies to pimp your WP to 10 points and more.

He's interesting, yes, but I think that the measure they're taking to help Tactics may be a bit of a mistake. You see, as we may all know, one of this game's most important characteristics/problems (at least in solo) is that of the three \"winning conditions\" it has (questing, defending, attacking) you need the three of them to win actually a game (unlike magic in which you can win by pure aggro, pure control, etc). So you can't really give Tactics what really should be mostly exclusive to Spirit. I they want to help Tactics put Progress tokens on the quest/locations why not basing this measure on Legolas? It's just so obvious. He's been there since the beggining, and he is in my opinion the best way to do this. Why not make a hero with, say, an ability like \"Whenever this hero defends and recieves no damage, put one progress token on target location/quest\"? Or an event that is Legolas' ability, like \"Choose a hero. If that hero attacked and detroyed an enemy this turn, place two progress token on the current quest\". That would help Tactics a LOT in becoming a viable sphere for mono-sphere decks, and it would still make Tactics stay Tactics.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe more I think about it, the more I think that the way they created Theoden is smart. His ability is a major help at the start of the game where tactics suffers the most questwise. Later you can add enough allies to pimp your WP to 10 points and more. Which is more than enough for most of the scenarios.\n\nExample:\n\nTheoden - 3 WP\n\nThalin - 2 WP\n\nBofur - 2WP\n\nEagles of the MM - 2 WP\n\nEnvoy of Pelargir - 1 WP\n\n \n\nYou could play these allies in 3-4 rounds.

I immediately thought of the possibility of there being few enemies in the quest after I posted my comment, but I would still support a Tactics sub-strategy of placing tokens during/after the combat phase. That may not be the whole solution, but that and also having more willpower allies and heroes and lower threat heroes would be the way to go in my opinion. I also believe Trained for War will become a very important card in future Tactics decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81747-final-ats-ap-pack-preview-the-morgul-vale/?do=findComment&comment=781835","commentId":781835,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1365185075,"content":" \n\nGizlivadi said:\n\nHmm, not really sure about Theoden.

And then they had this great idea that this cycle should address one of the legitimate shortcomings of the game (the difficulty of playing mono-sphere). And then they just slammed the two together.\n\n \n\nI don’t know, I could be completely wrong but when I look at Theoden it feels like he was supposed to be the Rohan Dain Ironfoot, but was ruined by committee. Like his ability was originally conceived as “Rohan characters get +1 willpower while Theoden is in play (or maybe commited to the quest)”. Still not as powerful as Dain without the attack boost (and more expensive in threat cost) but more personally versatile as he didn’t have to be ready and a thematic home run. And then someone decided that they wanted to support mono-sphere, so it became “tactics characters get +1 willpower”. And then somebody (rightly) pointed out that that was insanely OP so it was changed to “heroes with a printed tactics icon”.\n\n \n\nAnd you know, Theoden is one card so it’s not a huge deal but I really hope that isn’t indicative of how the mono-sphere theme will be applies to other cards in the cycle.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81747-final-ats-ap-pack-preview-the-morgul-vale/?do=findComment&comment=781839","commentId":781839,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1365186613,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\nJonof, I get your point.

I do not think Théoden will make Tactics a willpower sphere, it is just a slight boost, heroes are few.

It'd be great to have such attachment - a weapon - for Beregond.\n\nAs for the shortcomings, threat reductions seems to me to be by far the biggest trouble of the mono-Tactics deck (moreso solo, of course).
