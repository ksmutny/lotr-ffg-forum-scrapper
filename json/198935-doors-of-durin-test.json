As in use Henmarth to scry the top card, then if you have a match in your hand, immediately perform the Doors of Durin action?\n\n \n\n \n\nLast question...the game ends immediately when all the victory conditions are met correct? I couldn't open the doors but I had all the progress I needed and when I played Gandalf from my hand he dealt the last 4 damage to the Watcher. So at that point the game ends right in the planning phase as I have my 3 victory points and 5 progress on the stage right?\n\n \n\nThanks!\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/198935-doors-of-durin-test/?do=findComment&comment=1989941","commentId":1989941,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1452754997,"content":"1- Yes, you have to match the first letter even if it's \"A\" from \"A Burning Brand\" or a \"T\" from any card starting with \"the.\"  \n\n2- Yup, you can scry and then use the action on Doors of Durin.  Scry effects trivialize this quest.\n\n3- And yup, you win once victory conditions are met, immediately.  If you have 5 progress tokens on the quest and then Gandalf's effect kills the Watcher, you win immediately no matter what phase you're currently in."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/198935-doors-of-durin-test/?do=findComment&comment=1990120","commentId":1990120,"userName":"mewmartigan","timestamp":1452772063,"content":"Cool, thanks for the info. I lost to that quest about 5 or 6 times before my first victory so I just wanted to make sure I didn't accidentally cheat, haha."}]}
