It looks like they are drip feeding the saga expansions but from the entire card pool that we already have. \n\n60 cards in issue 1\n\n24 cards in issue 2\n\n18 cards in issue 3\n\n16 cards in issue 4\n\nThen I'm guessing aprox 16 cards an issue?\n\nSo theoretically in 10 regular months you'll pay £279.60 for 40 magazines and aprox 160 cards and associated counters and rules/strategy articles. Looks like a good portion of the magazine is the lore of middle earth and it's characters, artifacts locations etc. \n\nIssue 1 actually has the player drawing a starting hand of 3 cards. \n\nI get the vibe that there's going to be nothing new here and that it's just to get more mileage out of the existing game. \n\n \n\nI have the impression that FFG simply don't have the balls to say the game is done. (Although, players tend to ditch a game once a final announcement has been made. (Team covenant posted a message saying customers couldn't back out of paid subscriptions when FFG announced the end of Star Wars Destiny) so maybe I can't blame them. But this new magazine seems to be going over old ground for more money rather than producing a new space for the game and players. Like a cash grab. If this had been new cards, campaigns, even a new era it would have been very appealing. But even new players will be better off picking up the proper game than this magazine. All the strategy is on you tube and the internet why get a magazine. This logically means that FFG may not be printing sets now. Why would they? It would only hurt sales of the magazine. FFG have indeed kept this quiet which means it is a handing over the product rather than a real collaboration otherwise there would have been major announcements, articles and spotlight on new products. They were very quick to announce they have Dead of Winter from plaid hat games. \n\n \n\nThe only hopeful idea is that they are trying to bring in more players before releasing new content... but why not simply reprint existing stuff more often and ship.. the forums are always full of gamers demanding reprints so the market is there.  Fix the core set to include 3 of every card and it'll instantly be more successful. \n\nEdited March 7 by asgardianphil\nMore accurate facts on first 4 issues"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306613-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-the-magazine/?do=findComment&comment=3909047","commentId":3909047,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1583547495,"content":"I don't see how this can be a bad thing because it is a way of bringing new people into the game.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306613-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-the-magazine/?do=findComment&comment=3909109","commentId":3909109,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1583563387,"content":"Well this is interesting.

For some context, we'd already commited to buying Core (which arrived recently), and while I'd watched a series of Learn To Play videos, my little brother has come in completely blind. We'd been sleeving some Core cards and just having a look at art, but not done anything. We sat down together playing solo-handed, and went through each issue in turn. Bro has absolutely enjoyed Magazines 1-4, while I stumbled over a couple of things expecting a phase / keyword resolve to happen, but the key to playing the Magazine seems to be: FORGET EVERYTHING YOU ALREADY KNOW.\n\nBro followed along happily while I'd occasionally have to flick back and wonder why we weren't doing a certain action/phase/resolve at a time. This is the key to that much-maligned \"if you don't know, ignore it\" rule in Issue 1. It works perfectly if you just go along with the scripted plays in 1 + 2. It appears cards are straight reprints from Core (and beyond? I wouldn't know yet), so keywords are on a few cards that the Magazine doesn't bring-up at any point. There's one clunky thing in each Issue, sadly. 1 refers to Pippin when it clearly means Merry in that moment; 2 tells you include three copies of a card in a deck when you've only received two of them (so we grabbed one fom core), and it refers to drawing a card that's not in the right place (still a scripted play through at that point); 3 gives you a new Pippin hero but it isn't obvious you should include THAT version rather than the one from Issue 1 - means when you draw a specific card, you can't play it as it's the wrong sphere. It often refers to adding a \"progress token\" to your resource pools per hero at the start of a turn too, just a silly complication. 4 basically just throws you at it with a deck from the 80-ish player cards you've gathered so far. \n\nFew typos here and there. I'd love to see this go ahead in a few months time, hopefully the uptake on it is enough to greenlight a full-run, but it needs one more pass to smooth out some minor issues. Can't see anything that an experienced player would want from the series other than to 100% collection, but for introducing players to a brand-new game, it would draw you in. It's very thematic - we've left the shire, hunted gollum, crossed the barrow-downs, and survived Bree - and has a carrot dangling at the end of each Issue to make you want the next one.\n\n- G&M"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306613-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-the-magazine/?do=findComment&comment=3935384","commentId":3935384,"userName":"AlBigGuns","timestamp":1588778876,"content":"FYI this probably hasnt been cancelled.  It's standard fare for Hatchette to do a 4 issue test before committing fully to a project.  If the 4 issue test is successful then they'll restart it but with advertisements.   I use Hatchette for their 2000ad books, they seem decent enough to me.\n\n \n\nI tried to buy in but it doesn't seem available in Ireland.\n\nEdited May 6 by AlBigGuns"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306613-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-the-magazine/?do=findComment&comment=3935694","commentId":3935694,"userName":"Bushidough83","timestamp":1588805192,"content":"Anyone have any info on what cards are in issues 2 - 4?"}]}
