And starting next Saturday (7th September, UTC+2) you will be able to pre-register a room at the castle.\n\nThis is an event in Europe. About 120 people meet at a castle in Germany to play Lord of the Rings based games. Over 40 Lord of the Rings LCG players joined the event last year.\n\nThree news for the next event:Â \n1) We are proud to announce that Lord of the Rings LCG Lead Designer Caleb Grace will return as a guest of honor.Â \n2) We will offer a dormitory for women only.Â \n3) We will extend our last year very successful Marathon Challenge!\n\nAll information here:Â https://lureofmiddleearth.com/ [https://lureofmiddleearth.com/?fbclid=IwAR2_5_rZYI-PfCJDEL0JA4t-U90v4lNydkjRp-nigTpnoPXWFjV4FX-J6h4]\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask them here!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299600-lure-of-middle-earth-convention-2020/?do=findComment&comment=3776627","commentId":3776627,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1567510107,"content":"Me and my wife will definitely be back, can't wait."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299600-lure-of-middle-earth-convention-2020/?do=findComment&comment=3777255","commentId":3777255,"userName":"eliodoloro","timestamp":1567557624,"content":"Thanks for sharing this!

We could have gotten from Frankfurt to town beneath the castle by train, but taking in account the costs (we found a cheap rental) and the comfort of arriving/departing whenever needed with the car (not to mention avoiding the climb from the town to the castle with the luggage) we decided for that solution.\n\nWe will almost certainly go with that again next year so if you might be interested in some car share (and we can fit the timing) let us know.\n\n> 3 hours ago, aliprandifabio said:\n> \n> In addition, all player cards are in english language?\n\nMost are, but it depends, since a few people who organize/partecipate in events bring their own cards so sometimes you find cards in French, or German (or Italian in our case)\n\n> 3 hours ago, aliprandifabio said:\n> \n> I would love to be at this event.\n\nIt's really an amazing experience, highly recommended. Last year we ended up playing a few games of Fire in the Night with Caleb Grace and it was a blast. Also the Drinking Game is really fun."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299600-lure-of-middle-earth-convention-2020/?do=findComment&comment=3778142","commentId":3778142,"userName":"aliprandifabio","timestamp":1567665070,"content":"> 19 hours ago, Alonewolf87 said:\n> \n> Hi, I will write in English just in case someone else might need these info, but we are also from Italy (Bologna to be precise) and last year we flew to Frankfurt (the nearest airport), then took a rental car from there to the castle.

You can get a 15 Euro train ticket to Bacharach as far as I remember.\n\nLooking forward to meet you!

I was even ready to start a topic if there was not one yet ^^.\n\nMost of the french card that folk talk about are part of my fault. IÂ  only own french cards, try to bring more french (or rather, french-speaker) players. But I never have a problem playing with other player, whether their cards are in english or german. But hopefully most of the scenario where proposed in english ^^. But I found more difficulty to speak in english h24 so I recommend you to have a break and speak in your native language for some hours each day ;). But I do not have experienced many trips, and even less on solo, but do know very well the lotr cards so you may have a different experience.\n\nÂ I'm looking forward to see all of you!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299600-lure-of-middle-earth-convention-2020/?do=findComment&comment=3791746","commentId":3791746,"userName":"Nerdmeetsyou","timestamp":1569260433,"content":"Looking forward to see you soon Rouxxor!
