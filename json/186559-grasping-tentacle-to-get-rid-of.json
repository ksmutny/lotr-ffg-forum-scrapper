Or is the tentacle stuck for eternity?\n\nTa\n\nEdited August 29, 2015 by alexbobspoons"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186559-grasping-tentacle-to-get-rid-of/?do=findComment&comment=1762512","commentId":1762512,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1440864489,"content":"You are correct - Black Uruks are the only means of removing those tentacles other than having the character leave play, because unlike most such things, they don't specify that it must be an attachment you control."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186559-grasping-tentacle-to-get-rid-of/?do=findComment&comment=1762679","commentId":1762679,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1440872786,"content":"Agreed... a very rare instance where an enemy becomes your friend... if only very temporarily!
