After placing 2 damage tokens on her I realised this meant due to Cold from Angmar that her text box was now effectively blank meaning she would not leave play at the end of the round. She then stayed in play until I advanced to the next quest stage contributing 3 willpower to questing over several turns instead of one. Not a rules question or answer per say but an interesting situation I thought I would share.\n\n \n\nThe core set Gandalf ally would similarly have the same effect if damaged and would stay in play until Cold from Angmar leaves play (advancing to the next quest stage) allowing you to get far more bang for your buck with him."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180836-interesting-situation-in-weather-hills/?do=findComment&comment=1666802","commentId":1666802,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1434895906,"content":"Exposed Ridge is a great card to keep active if you have \"bounce-in\" allies like Gandalf.
