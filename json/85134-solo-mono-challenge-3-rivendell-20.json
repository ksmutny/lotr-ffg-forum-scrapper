But before we get there to deliver our package, we have to make our way through the mountains. And where there are mountains, there are Goblins too. Lots of Goblins!\n\nThis challenge is based on the Road to Rivendell quest. I have made some changes to increase the difficulty level, so that winning doesn't feel like a walk in the park. I'm now going to give you a list of the new rules:\n\n \n\n1. Players build a Shadow Deck before the game starts. To do that the player searches the encounter deck for the following 17 cards to create the Shadow Deck:\n\n- 5 copies of Goblin Spearman\n\n- 3 copies of Mountain Warg\n\n- 2 copies of Turbulent Waters\n\n- 2 copies of Warg Lair\n\n- 3 copies of Followed by Night\n\n- 2 copies of Orc Ambush\n\n \n\nEverytime an enemy is dealt a shadow card, the player draws from the Shadow Deck instead of the encounter deck (he still gets only one shadow card). The SD will get its own discard pile, and once the SD is emptied, the player reshuffles the SD discard pile to build a new SD (players do this only during the refresh phase).\n\n \n\n \n\n2. It's been raining for weeks and the ground is wet and muddy. Most of the known paths are impassible.\n\nInstead of drawing a random card during stage 1A the player searches the encounter deck for a copy of Pathless Country and places it in the staging area.\n\n \n\n \n\n3. Stage 2B gets the battle keyword.\n\n \n\n \n\n4. As your group flees from the Goblin cave, you cross the way of a Goblin patrol. Looks like you have to fight your way through them to get Arwen to Rivendell.\n\nInstead of drawing a random card during stage 3B the player searches both the enocunter deck and the discard pile for one copy of the following three cards and adds them in the staging area:\n\n- Chieftain of the Pit\n\n- Orc Raiders\n\n- Goblin Taskmaster\n\nAll Ambush effects on these cards will be triggered.\n\n \n\n \n\n5. Challenge mechanics\n\n \n\nThe players build a mono sphere deck for each of the four spheres. This deck may only contain cards that have the resource icon of that sphere or neutral cards. Arwen may not be added to your spirit deck.\n\nThe player has three attempts for each deck. Each victory gives you one point. The players get an extra point each (= up to 4 points) if they do not use the following cards in their decks:\n\n- Feint (tactics)\n\n- A Test of Will (spirit)\n\n- A Burning Brand (lore)\n\n- Steward of Gondor (leadership)\n\n \n\nThe player with the most points wins the challenge!\n\n \n\n \n\nEdit:\n\n \n\nThis challenge ends on 13th July, 8 pm CET\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCurrent rankings:\n\n \n\n \n\n1. Glowwyrm ~ 16 points of awesome\n\n \n\n2. benhanses ~ 15 taletelling points\n\n \n\n3. Narsil0420 ~ 14 astonishing points\n\n \n\n4. Khamul the Easterling ~ 13 heroic points\n\n \n\n4. leptokurt ~ 13 clone points\n\n \n\n6. Pharmboys2013 ~ 8 threequarter points\n\nEdited July 24, 2013 by leptokurt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=803810","commentId":803810,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1371264644,"content":"I'd advise you to play some games to get a feeling for the shadow deck mechanic.

Sorry for that. It should read\n\n \n\n\"every time an enemy attacks he draws a shadow card from the shadow deck instead of the encounter deck\".\n\n \n\nSo you still draw only one shadow card, but for example  you will never get Sleeping Sentry's shadow effect. However, there are five Goblin Spearmen in the shadow deck and some cards that put your enemy back to the staging area. I had games in which I had to fight four to five enemies at once - which is tons of fun!\n\n \n\n \n\nI fixed the wording in the rules.\n\nEdited July 3, 2013 by leptokurt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=804117","commentId":804117,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1371398262,"content":"oh jeez, no wonder i found this impossible, i was putting the cards in the staging area. makes a ridiculous difference. time to restart lol"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=804122","commentId":804122,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1371399777,"content":"Pharmboys2013 said:\n\noh jeez, no wonder i found this impossible, i was putting the cards in the staging area. makes a ridiculous difference. time to restart lol\n\n\n\nGuess you just invented the Nightmare Mode of this challenge.\n\nlol"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=805248","commentId":805248,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1371763991,"content":"well i'm 3/4s of the way thru the challenge with pretty underwhelming results\n\nstarted with lore which did great which i attributed completely to the dedicated encounter deck manipulation. won all 3 games\n\nheroes: Mirlonde (couldnt resist) - Denethor - Aragorn\n\ndidnt use burning brand so total = 4 points\n\n \n\nafter that was tactics which did not perform that well mostly because of the lack of willpower. even with the newer event trained for war, i still had trouble in the first and last stages especially when the revised enounter reveal in 3B. only won one of 3\n\nheroes: Thalin - Legolas - Beregond\n\ndidnt use feint so total = 2 points\n\n \n\nThe most frustrating sphere for me so far. lost 2 out of the 3 games soley becasue of SLEEPING FREAKING SENTRY killing Arwen.  on one of the times this treachery defeated me on literally the turn i would have won if ANY other card had been revealed. just devastating \n\nheroes: Aragorn - Boromir - Theodred\n\ndidnt use steward so total = 2 points\n\n(just realized as i'm writing this that every game i muliganed for steward lol)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=805291","commentId":805291,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1371794917,"content":"Pharmboys2013 said:\n\nwell i'm 3/4s of the way thru the challenge with pretty underwhelming results\n\nstarted with lore which did great which i attributed completely to the dedicated encounter deck manipulation. won all 3 games\n\nheroes: Mirlonde (couldnt resist) - Denethor - Aragorn\n\ndidnt use burning brand so total = 4 points\n\n \n\nafter that was tactics which did not perform that well mostly because of the lack of willpower. even with the newer event trained for war, i still had trouble in the first and last stages especially when the revised enounter reveal in 3B. only won one of 3\n\nheroes: Thalin - Legolas - Beregond\n\ndidnt use feint so total = 2 points\n\n \n\nThe most frustrating sphere for me so far. lost 2 out of the 3 games soley becasue of SLEEPING FREAKING SENTRY killing Arwen.  on one of the times this treachery defeated me on literally the turn i would have won if ANY other card had been revealed. just devastating \n\nheroes: Aragorn - Boromir - Theodred\n\ndidnt use steward so total = 2 points\n\n(just realized as i'm writing this that every game i muliganed for steward lol)\n\n\n\n \n\nWow, did you draw Sleeping Sentry twice?

This led to some huge ramping up of enemies and frustration watching them retreat. There were times that I just had to put progress on hold until I got enemies under control, especially for Leadership and Lore, and led to some long games! I enjoyed the changes though, especially the battle questing stage.\nReally, the MVP for the quest was Arwen herself. with good starting willpower and that resource, she helped cover for the weaknesses in certain spheres.\nWhat surprised me was that Spirit and Tactics, which I see as the more unbalanced spheres, did really well and Leadership and Lore struggled more. I think that the rush through deck with Spirit, definitely has great advantage and will probably see a lot of play as the tournament scene develops for the game. It also gives me hope that Hobbit-sneaky decks will be able to do well in some quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=805716","commentId":805716,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1371992167,"content":"Thanks for the kind feedback, guys!\n\n \n\nI just finished my leadership attempt.

 Another Goblin Spearmen shadow card?  Not so fast!  After three spheres of watching those pesky things pile up into the staging area (or watching enemies hop back into the staging area), it was satisfying to discard them with Balin and Dunedain Watcher.  Theodred and Arwen provided the extra resources so that I could spend in the planning phase and still have at least one on Boromir and one on Balin.  This was also the sphere I had the most luck with.  I played five games with this deck (two to test, three for the challenge) and drew ONE Sleeping Sentry.  That was appreciated.\n\n \n\nTotal score: 16\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the challenge and the changes to the scenario.  It felt thematic, dodging hordes of orcs that threatened to pile up on you, being ambushed by three orcs at once, then having to run for safety at the end.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=807920","commentId":807920,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1372882053,"content":"Glowwyrm, I'm happy you had a blast.

Frodo replaces Eowyn, since it was apparent that I didn't need her questing ability.  And Frodo filled that defending hole that I struggled with in the first round.  Having Light of Valinor and Ancient Mathom in my first hand helped immensely.  It took me a bit longer to get the Zigi-Gazer resource machine going, but the combat aspect worked easier with Frodo in there. Ending threat was 28.\n\n \n\nThird Run:  WIN.  Had Zigil Miner, Stargazer, UC, and Ancient Mathom in my initial draw.  Pretty much more of the same.  Avoid conflict when necessary, reduce threat like crazy, and quest out.  Ended with my threat at 14.\n\n \n\nDidn't use A Test of Will:  bonus point.\n\nTotal points (so far):  4\n\n \n\nThoughts:  Spirit definitely wasn't going to be a \"rush through it\" deck.  But once the pattern got going (resources, get as many allies out as possible, stall, threat reduction, use Eleanor when needed) it simply became a \"slow and steady\" race.  The second site was the trickiest with the Battle keyword added, but by cycling enough, it got me the attack strength I needed in time.  Spread a lot of wounds around where necessary, then did massive questing to finish of site 3."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=810973","commentId":810973,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1373409565,"content":"Leadership.\n\n \n\nAfter seeing how simple it was to keep ahead of the encounter deck with Spirit's threat-reduction, I wasn't sure how Leadership would fare without all those nice blue cards to help avoid conflict.  But I also figured that the stronger stats of the heroes and allies should make the Battle site and combat quicker to get through.\n\n \n\nHeroes:\n\nFirst Run:  Thorin, Gloin, Balin\n\nSecond Run:  Thorin, Dain, Balin\n\nThird Run: Theodred, Dain, Balin\n\n \n\nI wasnt sure whether to run with the dwarves or not, particularly since I wasn't running a majority of dwarven allies.  After deciding to go with them, it bacame apparent that Balin's shadow control ability was going to be more important than Thorin's resource gain (replaced by Theodred's), and Gloin just didn't end up being as useful as I thought he might be.\n\n \n\nFirst run:  WIN.  32 threat.  My initial concern was that the threat generation would get to me, but it wasn't really hard to make sure I quested enough to stay ahead of the encounter deck.  However, I couldn't avoid the comabat like I could with Spirit.  Fortunately, I learned real quickly that my MVP of these Leadership decks was going to be the Longbeard Elder.  The ability to see the top card of the encounter pile without having to discard a card or exhaust and ally or hero was just crazy good!  This game ended with being able to freeze those final dropped enemies with some Fresh Tracks, then hitting them with the Sneaky Gandalf combo...\n\n \n\nSecond run:  WIN.  43 threat.  Didn't get out of the gate as strongly.  Didn't see a Longbeard Elder until the 4th or 5th turn, and only saw one copy of Gandalf (later in the game).  But ended with being able to quest the dwarven horde with Dain ready and Faramir using his willpower boosting ability.  Wasn't sure how well the last site was going to be with Goblin Spearman x3, Black Uruk, Chieftan of the Pit, Orc Raider, and Taskaster on the table... but was able to get a Longbeard Orcslayer out with Sneak Attack twice in the last two turns to pretty much wound all the orcs away.\n\n \n\nThird Run:  WIN.  34 threat.  Had Longbeard Elder out on turn one.  That's really all that mattered in the end.  Cram kept Dain ready  Was able to quest to site 3 while Gandalf was on the table, and with a couple Fresh Tracks, Strength of Arms, and Dawn Take You All was able to ready all my allies, ignore some enemies, and not worry about a nasty shadow in a rush to the finish.  Faramir and the dwarven horde did their job.\n\n \n\nDidn't use Steward of Gondor:  Bonus point.\n\n \n\nPoints for Leadership:  4\n\n \n\nTotal points do far:  8\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=811267","commentId":811267,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1373442745,"content":"Finished my tactics playthrough yesterday.

Being able to use Master of Lore to play Henamarth, Mirkwood Runner, Haldir, and Warden of Healing all on a single turn for a total of 7 resources just felt like cheating.  Game was pretty much done by the time I moved to site 3b.  The Chieftan of the Pit had come out the turn before moving from site 2, and I had a Ranger's Spike waiting for him, then dropped Gildor and Gandalf the turn following getting to 3b and the questing was just a piece of cake.\n\n \n\nSecond run:  Mirlonds, Beravor, Elronde - win @ 38.  I actually thought I was going to lose this one from the get go... not a great starting hand, even after a mulligan.  The first turn encounter draw was 2 surging Crebains into Black Uruks, with Pathless Country already on the table.. was adding 3 threat to start the game off turn one.  But that's how good Lore was with this scenarion.  It required a lot of stalling on my part, and playing 3 Gandalf's to reduce threat to keep me in it... but once Henemarth and Rumours of the Earth got into play, it just gave the advantage of knowing what the encounter deck was throwing down...\n\n \n\nThird run:  Mirlonde, Beravor, Aragorn - win @ 39.  An okay opening hand (P.O.L, Warden of Healing, Gleowine)... but the key to this one was playing Risk Some Light on turn one to manipulate the encounter deck's first three cards.  Made those first 2/3 turns a breeze.  By that time, I had Henemarth and Rumours back into their cycles, and used 2 more copies of Risk Some Light to move one Sleeping Sentry to the bottom of the deck and just totally control the cards I faced.\n\n \n\n3 wins = 3 points.\n\nNo Burning Brand played = Bonus point\n\n \n\n4 Lore Points\n\n4 Leadership Points\n\n4 Spirit Points\n\n \n\n12 total points so far.\n\nEdited July 14, 2013 by benhanses"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=814015","commentId":814015,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1373838827,"content":"Finally, Tactics.\n\n \n\nI really thought this would be a walk in the park...  And it was \"feast or famine\" for Tactics.\n\n \n\nFirst run:  Hama, Legolas, Gimli - win @ 36 threat.\n\n \n\nWas able to slowly build my ally base, kill the enemies that popped out.  Legolas + Hands Upon the Bow + Rivendell Blade + Blade of Gondor worked its magic.  Got Radagast out early enough for him to be useful with the Eagles that I was playing (Eagles of the Misty Mountain x2).  Trained for War was useful when needed.\n\n \n\nSecond run: Hama, Legolas, Thalin - win @ 37 threat.  One of the craziest endings I've had to a game yet.  With a handful of enemies on the table, I had Sleeping Sentry drop out and  exhaust all my characters.  The enemies ended up killing Hama and Thalin, and I thought it was pretty much over for me.  But Legolas survived with 2 resources on him for the next round, and I was able to play Trained for War, and quested everyone I had on the table.  Got 2 more questing points than I needed to squeeze out the win.\n\n \n\nThird run:  Legoals, Boromir, and Thalin. - loss.  This was just one of those games that started off horrible.  The n it got REALLY bad... lol.  Even with a Trained for War and Gandalf to play in the first two turns, I ended up with 3x Pathless Country's and 2x Plundered Armories on the table from the first rounds.  Gandalf and TFW only delayed the inevitable, as there was no way for me to get enough to compete with 15 threat in locations and no enemies for Legolas to kill.  Threated out quickly.  Hate ending everything on a sour note...\n\n \n\n2 wins = 2 points\n\nNo Feint = 1 bonus point.\n\n \n\n3 Tactics points\n\n12 points (Lore, Leadership, Spirit)\n\n \n\n15 Total points to end the challenge.\n\nEdited July 14, 2013 by benhanses"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85134-solo-mono-challenge-3-rivendell-20/?do=findComment&comment=820532","commentId":820532,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1374652766,"content":"Here are the final results of this competition.
