Does Steward of Gondor have to be attached to a Leadership hero or can it attach to any hero that player controls?\n\nSelf Preservation says \"Attach to Character\".  I assume this means it can attach to a hero or an ally.  Does the hero/ally have to have a matching resource symbol or will any hero/ally do?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53641-attachment-matching/?do=findComment&comment=532362","commentId":532362,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1316819830,"content":"You can play attachments on any hero, unless the card specifies otherwise.
