Just wondering: when 3B is revealed and I have to discard my attachments and discard allies until I only have 6 cost remaining, do I choose the order in which they're discarded? Or is it simultaneous? I'm wondering if Horn of Gondor would be triggered for all the allies that get discarded. Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178709-3b-nightmare-foundations-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=1643958","commentId":1643958,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1433151123,"content":"Both. Since it's simultaneous, the first player choose the order."}]}
