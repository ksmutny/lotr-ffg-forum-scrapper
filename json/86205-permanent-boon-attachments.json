Do you think there will also be boon attachments such as armor and weapons (reminiscent of Hobbit treasures)? I definitely think Sting would be an awesome boon card.\n\n \n\nWith all of these permanent boon attachments, the heroes are going to get pretty buffed out pretty quickly through the campaigns. That suggests that burdens will have to balance out these \"level ups\" or the quests will have to get increasingly difficult (or a combination of both)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86205-permanent-boon-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=812572","commentId":812572,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1373588624,"content":"I hope Sting and all those cool objects will be attachments so we can use them in other scenarios."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86205-permanent-boon-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=812580","commentId":812580,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373589152,"content":"i agree, i hope that most are saved for real cards, otherwise we lose a key point where it would be perfect to release a card, rather than in a random one in a later AP\n\n \n\npersonally i was a little dissapointed that we didnt get the items on the treasure cards as real cards\n\n \n\nas for the balancing, it depends how numerous boons/burdens are....have ffg actually said? i dont feel there will be all that many, just enough to signify key events in the books...though by mordor we may be a little 'heavy' with burdens haha\n\nEdited July 12, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86205-permanent-boon-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=812605","commentId":812605,"userName":"Samwise Gamgee","timestamp":1373592116,"content":"I feel you on wanting to play with some of these iconic weapons in other APs.
