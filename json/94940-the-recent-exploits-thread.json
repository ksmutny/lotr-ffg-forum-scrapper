Guess what that card was? The other TROLL!! Needless to say I was dead by turn three, but I took one of the trolls down with me.\n\nSo I tried it again and did better until a total brain fart killed me. I made it to stage 2 (requires 16 tokens to clear). I had 15 tokens on it, and had lost one hero and my other two were hurting, had a few Allys out also. So I needed one more token to clear stage two, I was at 48 Threat. I decided I'll quest with just the Longbeard Eldar and topdeck a location to finish off stage 2. (what the hell was I thinking?). So not only did I not topdeck a location, but totally brain farted on the fact that there was a location in the staging area with a 3 Threat value.

Numerous rounds both S'Glorfindel & Celeborn would be questing & ready - very helpful.\n\n \n\nOne combo that I really wanted to try but the card never showed up was Silvan Refuge & children of the sea, for 5 willpower injection into the quest and then playing Tree people on the Refuge before the end of the phase.

Or is it limited to once a game per-card? As in if you run 3 cards, can you use that ability 3 times, one for each card.\n\n\nAlso, if 2 players use Landroval, then can both players can activate their Landroval cards separately? I know you can only have 1 on the table at a time, but dose the \"once per game\" thing cover ALL players or only the player that controls the card. Lastly, we know that going into your hand dose not reset the \"once per game\" rule, but dose playing the card form your gravyard also not reset the ability? Thanks as always for giving us a defiant answer.\n\nA: - Limits are player specific, each player can reach the limit.\n\n \n\n\"Per game\" limits are not card specific, they refer to any copy of the effect under that player's control. If you have reached the \"per game\" limit, you cannot trigger that effect again, with another copy of the card in your deck, a copy of the card you gained control of from another player, or from the same card that has left play and re-entered the game.\n\nEdited February 17, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94940-the-recent-exploits-thread/?do=findComment&comment=987276","commentId":987276,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1392650432,"content":"Yeah, I agree it's surprising that it is legal.  I can confirm that Aragorn + Desperate Alliance is overpowered!  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94940-the-recent-exploits-thread/?do=findComment&comment=1023087","commentId":1023087,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1395550954,"content":"Haven't had a lot of playtime lately, just went through and finished each of the Voice of Isengard quests once, then stopped altogether for awhile.  I had fun with the staging area attack decks that I put together for The Fords of Isen, though, and finally got around to putting those decks together again and took them against Journey Down the Anduin.  We destroyed the quest, probably the easiest time I've ever had playing that one.\n\n \n\nBard across the table from Dunhere is a fun little combo.  Bard with his Great Yew Bow can declare attacks via the bow's Combat Action -- which means he can attack out of usual turn order.  This means consistent debuffing of stronger enemies as needed, allowing Dunhere to apply the coup de grace each time.  I'm looking forward to taking these decks against some other enemy-heavy quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94940-the-recent-exploits-thread/?do=findComment&comment=1023115","commentId":1023115,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1395554939,"content":"> Yeah, I agree it's surprising that it is legal.  I can confirm that Aragorn + Desperate Alliance is overpowered!  \n\nSneak attack Gandalf and Leadership tome + Aragorn Desperate Alliance and other player.
