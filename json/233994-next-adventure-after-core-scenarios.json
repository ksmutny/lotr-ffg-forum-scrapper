What makes you say that?\n\n \n\nThe Mirkwood cycle was released before Khazad-Dum and the Hobbit sagas.\n\n \n\nI've been playing by order of release (exception: haven't played the LotR saga quests yet, waiting to play all 6 sets back to back once they've all been released), and that's my preference. I like to follow the sequential evolution of the game and card pool... and yeah, that's not a rule. Others may have differing opinions.\n\n \n\nI'm currently half way through the Ringmaker cycle, if that helps the OP at all in his decision making.\n\nEdited November 5, 2016 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233994-next-adventure-after-core-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=2489440","commentId":2489440,"userName":"shosuko","timestamp":1478331914,"content":"Oh, you're right, I was confused.  I thought he meant he finished the \"core set quests\" meaning Mirkwood cycle, but I think you're right and he means he finished just the 3 core set quests, in which case yes, Mirkwood cycle is next."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233994-next-adventure-after-core-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=2489478","commentId":2489478,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1478339921,"content":"If it is between Mirkwood Cyle and Hobbit Saga, then I'd take Mirkwood for the quests.
