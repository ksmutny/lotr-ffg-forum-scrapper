(But I didn't look too closely as I didn't want to spoil the game before I had a chance to play it.)\n\n¬†\n\nThis misprint appears to be newly introduced as the same copy of the event card on The Card Game DB doesn't have the misprint.\n\n¬†\n\nAlso, I have recent reprints of the previous two saga expansions, and they don't have the same problem.
