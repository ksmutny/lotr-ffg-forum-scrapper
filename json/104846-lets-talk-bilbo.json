Pretty good from the first glance, but... game can be played in multiplayer, you know.\n\nSo, basically, the thing currently are:\n\nIn 1 player game player gets 100% card draw boost from Bilbo;\n\nIn 2 player game, the potency of this boost is halved to 50%;\n\nIn 3 player game, it's shrinked to 33%;\n\nAnd finally, in a 4 player game it's no more than 25% of a boost.\n\n \n\nNot so shiny anymore. More of it, you can't even choose a player to prosper - it's tied to the first player token. Even worse, Bilbo is weakling of a character by himself and requires major work around him to get him running well... and for that you need a card draw, which becomes extremely spread the more players are in the game. \n\n \n\nSo, my question is... were designers too harsh when they were giving him this much of a threat cost disadvantage? Could it be justified? What kind of a errata do you think could help him? Perhaps lovering his threat cost a bit? Tweaking his ability a little? Some minor stat boost?\n\n \n\nI have a couple of ideas about him of my own. Most of them revolve around his ability.\n\nMost liberal one is changing his text into:\n\n\"At the beginning of the resource phase, choose a player to draw 1 card.\"\n\n \n\nThat'll keep his approximately at the same power level, but will at least give the player some control over what's going on with his ability. And control gives birth to decision, which is fun in my humble opinion.\n\n \n\nWhadda'ya think?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1062962","commentId":1062962,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1398521531,"content":"Good post....\n\n \n\nMy idea is:\n\n \n\nBilbo is similar than Gleowine:\n\n \n\nGl%C3%A9owine.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/Core-Set/Gl%C3%A9owine.png]\n\n \n\nBut, the problem of Bilbo is only first player can draw, you can't chose who draws.\n\nBut, the advantatges are:\n\n...free cost in start of game (no need 2 resources, neither need the card in hand); no need exhaust him to draw.\n\n \n\nWith these pros and contras, lets think:\n\n- Bilbo only gives to you a 'peculiar' Gleowine?\n\n \n\nOr better said: 3 threat points cost (the extra 3 threat points of Bilbo) are good for a 'direct card in hand' free with 2 cost? Let's see: Galadhrim Greeting cost 3 resources per -6 threat...\n\n \n\nThe-Galadhrim%27s-Greeting.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/Core-Set/The-Galadhrim%27s-Greeting.png]\n\n \n\nSo 1'5 resources would be 3 threat.\n\n \n\nWe can think about the standard cost of 3 threat points are 1'5 resources.\n\n \n\nVerdict: Bilbo's hability is better than normal ranking, because his cost is cheaper: you get for free an 'hability' with cost 2 rescoures (as Gleowine, even better: you have him in first hand automaticaly); the conditions is 'raise 3 threat'... but it is cheaper than Galadhrim Greeting, where decreasing 3 threat (the penalty of Bilbo) would cost only 1'5 resources, not 2 (the cost, remember, bilbo 'gives').\n\n \n\nSaid as other way: Bilbo gives you 2 resources by reasing 3 threat, while Greeting only gives you 1,5 res.\n\n \n\nBilbo then is 'cheaper'. Plus, i return to say, you 'have in first hand' this card you are wanting :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nFinally: there are 2 good reasons for chose Bilbo, the 0'5 resource you win (diference betwen Bilbo and Galadhrim Greeting), and the 'card in first hand you want'. It needs, then another penalty: who draws the card will be the first player (you can't chose).\n\n \n\nUf!

All at the cost of 1 threat.\n\n \n\nElladan+Elrohir: Both got +1 threat penalty, which is technically -1 threat bonus as they are meant to be played together and while paired, get stats worth of 1 over their threat cost + an awesome ability.\n\n \n\nElrond: +1 for being able to pay for ally of ANY sphere and increasing all heal effects, basically making Warden of Healing an overpowered sheet? For just +1 threat cost? And don't forget while it's not his printed ability - he is the only one who can work with Vilya.\n\n \n\nGrima: +1 threat for being able to reduce any cost of any card of any sphere. Also triggers any doom-related effects, which will(I'm sure) grow in numbers as cycle progresses. Diminishes and shrinks in multiplayer, yes, but if all players build accordingly - will prove extremely useful. Technically +1 resource per turn, +2 if you got your keys of Orthanc out.\n\n \n\nHirluin the Fair: +1 threat for... do I even need to say anything about this hero? :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]\n\n \n\nMerry: Probably should't have listed this one, but just for the sake of it - he immediately gets his threat worth with his passive bonus just from him alone, and continues to grow with each other hobbit hero you brought along. He can even strike for pounding 4 if you're playing any of sagas. Oh, and he's also readies people.\n\n \n\nTheoden: I listed Merry here, so for the sake of consistency, I'll list Theoden too here. Let's just say that he actually overworks his threat cost for each other Tactics hero in play, regardless of the player controlling him.

Also to consider him for questing or attacking is sort of a joke I think. Maybe I would use him in a multiplayer game, oddly only for his diminishing ability though.

Maybe along with the attachment there could be an event card that does something like \"Action: Search your deck for a 'ring' attachment and add it to your hand. Then shuffle your deck.\" That way with 6 Bilbo \"buff\" cards you will have about a 12-13% chance to get at least one of them in your starting hand, compared to only about 6-7% with only 3 cards.

You claim that the card draw being split between multiple players reduces the effect - I assume on the grounds that in 2 player you only draw 3 cards instead of 4. However you disregard the fact that in multiplayer the threat cost for the ability is also relatively lower. (+3 threat cost for 1 player, a relative cost of +1.5 threat for 2 player).\n\nThe two players can more easily benefit from the free card draw without needing more supporting cards (resource acceleration primarily). The free card draw being passive is also not relatively worse - it's still +1 hero still available. Bilbo like all hobbits has poor stats it's true, but the hobbit trait is significantly more powerful now than it was when Bilbo card was created (then it was basically blank but his card draw ability was more unique in the card pool too).\n\nBilbo in a hobbit deck is a viable alternative to lore pippin to get you access to fast hitch, especially if you don't think you need the +3 to engagement costs (which isn't needed or relevant in a lot of quests).\n\n I also think you're heavily undervaluing the benefit of +1 card in your starting hand (when the start of the game is the most critical) even compared to Berevor who may help more (with a ready effect) but you need to draw it turn 1 for that effect.\n\nI'm not convinced the ability is worth +3 threat (although I think Bilbo is easily playable with a 3 threat cost). if Bilbo was threat 6 he would probably be in every lore line up forever though, I can't believe that people in this thread seriously think that he should be 6.\n\nThe extra threat cost heros are mainly paying for additional benefits -\n\nGrima and Beregond each cost 1 threat extra - and are paying for resource advantage.\n\nHirlon, Elladan and Elrohir pay for the potential for better stats at a cost of 1 extra. (These guys also have the penalty of getting worse if things start to go against the player).\n\nElrond pays 1 threat for having two abilities. (the second is pretty weak though)\n\nNow to my mind Bilbo is paying 3 threat and gets: A passive ability, that always triggers every turn, and is always useful.\n\nSo I think 3 threat is perfectly fine actually. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1064431","commentId":1064431,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1398676279,"content":"> Misprint.

This means that Dain is either undercosted (he could be threat 13 or 14 easily and still get played) or his ability is just too good to balance against the other heroes (which is my opinion).\n\nBilbo looks bad compared to Dain sure. So does Loreagon, As do all the other global boost heroes (Celebron, Boromir, Theodred). Basically everyone looks bad compared to Dain - so saying that Bilbo does too just doesn't prove anything except to bring your balance judgement into question.\n\nYou haven't responded to my argument that paying extra threat is usually for small benefits or large benefits with associated costs.\n\nBilbo is one of the only heroes in the game who can be hit by a cannot ready/exhaust affect and still help you because his ability is passive. \n\nBilbo guarantees you access to his stats and the card draw unlike the only other hero that can guarantee card draw, Berevor. Now Berevor has better stats, 1 extra willpower, 1 extra attack and 2 extra hit points - for 1 extra threat. However Berevor can only give you 2 cards or 2 willpower, bilbo can give you 1 card and 1 willpower. As a defender (which is what Bilbo is best at) Bilbo can give you 1 card and 2 defence compared to 2 cards or 2 defence.\n\nAlso while Bilbo's card draw is no longer as good as it was (we have access to more card draw abilities than we used too) having the hobbit trait is better than ever. Bilbo can be targeted by 3 fast hitches, 2 ringmails,  boots of erebor, one hobbit cloak, a burning brand, bill the pony and help to power take no notice and receive halfling determination x3.\n\nThis extreme combo would give BIlbo 4 actions + 1 card a turn, 6 hitpoints, 4 defence vs enemies with a lower engagement than his threat and 6 vs enemies with a higher one, he could ignore all shadow cards and potentially have 12 defence, 7 attack and 7 wilpower.\n\nNow yes, that requires you to put a lot of effort into bilbo (although in a hobbit deck that was red/purple/green you would probably run all those cards), realistically you wouldn't put all the fast hitches on bilbo or use the halfling derminations in one go like that. However as a defender you may well give bilbo all the other cards.\n\n You just can't get Berevor anywhere near that good - the hobbit trait is just better than the ranger one currently.\n\nBut really Bilbo's ability being completely passive - it doesn't even require an action window. If Bilbo is on the table you get the card - it's not possible to stop it, is so good. \n\nMaybe I could see him being threat 8 instead - anything lower than that and Bilbo would just be an auto-include.

You're basically arguing that you'd never play bilbo in multiplayer where you find him too weak - although I think you're doing a terrible job of arguing for your point because I think you're off topic too much.\n\nFor instance you basically argue that Bilbo is weak in multiplayer because of his ability ties to the first player token, but you didn't explain how you would change his threat in relation to this - only that it should be changed.\n\nI mean I'm not clear on whether you think if your proposed change of (Bilbo's controller choosers a player) would then mean the ability was worth its 3 threat cost?\n\nIf you are arguing that then you must accept that in solo play his ability is worth 3 extra threat?\n\nif you're not arguing that then is your point that it's not possible for this ability to be worth 3 threat? (i.e. one card a turn would never be worth that cost).\n\nI would argue that a targeted +1 card a turn as a passive effect would be too good in two player, but maybe in 4 player it would help to keep bilbo more relevant. However I think that balancing him at 2 is more important than at 4.\n\nAlso the absolutely strongest argument for Bilbo being a weak hero is the value of his new ally card - in much the same way that Faramir's ally is very strong so it's hard to justify his hero (increasingly hard in more players where you can guarantee someone running faramir ally). This is a problem for all heroes that also have good ally cards though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1066375","commentId":1066375,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1398796791,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > God, you're tough.

Your first post has been reasonable, but there were certain points I disagree with:\n\n \n\n- it's not diffcult to boost Bilbo's stats; his ability helps to get the cards that you need\n\n- you completely ignored his Hobbit trait and his sphere\n\n- you based your critics on a 3-4 player game, which should never be the basis to balance a card in general\n\n- you ignore there are cards that specifically reward a large number of players, so it's perfectly ok to have at least some cards that favour a small number"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1066418","commentId":1066418,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1398798888,"content":"-other heroes are not that hard to boost, it's not the reason to boost starting threat by 3;\n\n-no trait in history has granted anybody a 3 threat overcharge;\n\n-the cards in general should try to maintain balance between all numbers of players;\n\n-and again, that's an extremely bad excuse for the starting threat overcharge of that size."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1066479","commentId":1066479,"userName":"KennedyHawk2","timestamp":1398802432,"content":"More Trololol Trolling, excellent thread read.\n\n \n\nI play Bilbo I enjoy his ability in 1 and 2 player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104846-lets-talk-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=1067027","commentId":1067027,"userName":"ZanzibarLand","timestamp":1398844822,"content":"So is Bobo Baggins worth it or not?

But let's try :\n\n \n\nMy only point of comparison is the uniqueness of his ability : Bilbo ability (eg drawing) is quite common especially in Lore sphere.

Although I think it should be -1 threat for the 3rd player and -2 threat for the 4th. It might be neater to just say -1 threat per additional player. \n\nI find that Bilbo is completely playable in 2 player but I can see how he is less appealing at 4.
