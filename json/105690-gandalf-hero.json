He is the most iconic character in any of the books or movies.\n\nDoubling is fine, and inevitable.  I'd rather see multi-sphere versions of my favorite heroes than lots of FFG created heroes.  But doubling does make co-op more difficult, especially if you don't have time to coordinate decks beforehand.  This is why I think a hero Gandalf would be such a big deal.  Faramir the ally is a great card, but if someone shows up with Faramir the hero, there are a few in-sphere options for replacing what he does (Sword that was Broken, Visionary Leadership, Dain).  There isn't a replacement for Gandalf.  Whether you're a leadership deck using the Sneak Attack-Core combo, a low threat deck running Hobbit Gandalf as a fourth hero, a Tactics deck relying on Gandalf to drop their threat, etc.  There's no way to replace his neutral sphere versatility.  I know that there are sometimes conflicts because someone is running Hobbit Gandalf and someone else wants to play Core Gandalf, but if the person who needs to play Core Gandalf is that desperate, you can always allow Hobbit Gandalf to be discarded at the end of the round.  A hero Gandalf would take away that flexibility, and lock down any deck that was counting on Gandalf in some shape or form.  That's why the hero Gandalf would have to be amazing.  otherwise, he wouldn't be worth it. \n\nThat's why I think we could have a saga specific Gandalf hero in store.  It makes a lot of sense for him to appear at this point in the story, it would be very cool to recreate Gandalf's moments of glory (who isn't excited about the idea of Gandalf taking down the Balrog?), and would maintain the balance for the rest of the quests.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078007","commentId":1078007,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1399596272,"content":"If they simply made a Gandalf hero with stats 4wp, 4a, 4d, and 4hp without any abilities on his card, that would be insanely amazing.

That is my objective analysis.\n\n \n\nMy subjective analysis is that to make a hero Gandalf only able to pay for neutral cards is silly. I personally never have more than 10% neutral cards in any of my decks, making Gandalf's resources essentially useless. And if you did have at least a third of your deck neutral cards, your other sphere's main focus will be on allies since there are a lack of neutral ones. Deck building is the acme of skill in this game, but limiting your flexability in deck building by using a duo neutral/sphere is poor strategizing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078893","commentId":1078893,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1399658824,"content":"You can splat a song on him, yet still it will be dumb.
