You're basically skirting around the 50-card deck limit and playing with a 47-card deck at that point, which means a little better efficiency for getting you're good cards up.

Lots of fun in solo mode, multi player must be even more awesome. My second game was very interesting. I played with new Glorfindel, Frodo and Bifur. I lost Frodo against \"Unexpected Trap\" in round  1, but had two copies of \"Resourceful\" in my starting hand to balance this out. Imladris Starglazer is the powerful card she promised to be, very useful in this scenario. Threat managing becomes a whole lot easier with her, and some of the monster's effects can be manipulated by her.\n\nThis is an excellent designed quest, a challenge but still beatable (at least with spirit/lore). The opponents are awesome, the treacheries are nasty, the locations not too harmful, and there are some nice objectives to claim.

IMO the toughest one is \"Cave of the Ancient One\" (translation correct?). This card forces you to reveal 4 encounter cards, but needs only 5 progress tokens. In my last game I had a card that forced me to discard my whole hand and to reveal two encounter cards. This one needs 11 progress. That game was rather easy, but still fun and interesting.\n\nThe (Ancient) Nameless One's are nasty enemies, but can be defeated easily with Gandalf, before they do any harm. Stargazer is very helpful to reduce their ATT dn HP to a minimum.\n\nBtw I love how they screwed the Ziggy decks with this one!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66113-picked-up-foundation-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=654636","commentId":654636,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1341583613,"content":"Got it today. Play 3 games lose all of them! My Elven brother +Eowin deck not really good against this one.Change Eowyn to new Glorifindel.\n\nPlay another 2 game. 1 lose and win one at last! But is not  cose of Glorifindel  but is really depend which quest 4 you got. If you get easy one you have a god chance to win. If you get one with 4 cards revealed every time i lose. Anayway quest is cool cannot wait for coop game with 2 or even 3 players.\n\nThis time FFG got to the point. Hope SAF will be also cool!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66113-picked-up-foundation-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=655353","commentId":655353,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1341757018,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nThis time FFG got to the point.
