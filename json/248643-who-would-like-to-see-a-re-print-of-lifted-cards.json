We will still probably see a new deluxe expansion based in Dale/Erebor/Iron hills and its cicle, but beyond.\n\nPersonally, before the line ends, I would love to see some old cards re-printed with a \"lift up\" errata which would make them worth being included in a deck. I know there are plenty of such cards (see this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236256-lotr-lcg-rework-project-v10-release/] for some examples), but it pains me to see some very iconic Middle-Earth stuff that is not worth putting (nearly) in any deck. For example, Radagast or the Horn of Gondor.\n\nI specially like the idea for Radagast [https://www.flickr.com/photos/146910575@N03/31409463396/in/album-72157673544027673/] from John Constantine [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/250511-john-constantine/] or the much more thematically correct Horn of Gondor [https://theshadowarchive.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Horn-of-Gondor.png] from Dav Flamerock [https://theshadowarchive.net/lord-of-the-rings/]. Another nice card that could use a lift is the White Council, which could nicely be errated to include the sentence \"Players may spend resources as a group to pay for the White Council\" in line with some of the new cards we are seeing these days. https://www.flickr.com/photos/146910575@N03/31409463396/in/album-72157673544027673/"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248643-who-would-like-to-see-a-re-print-of-lifted-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2763997","commentId":2763997,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1493740670,"content":"I would like to have all of the cards that have seen errata.  I would like a core completion set.  I would like some of the cards you are talking about.\n\nI don't believe it will happen."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248643-who-would-like-to-see-a-re-print-of-lifted-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2764794","commentId":2764794,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1493761212,"content":"May be not but I have some hope it may happen :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
