To see if the pack you are buying has the updated cards, with corrections and errata, you just look at the barcode on the bottom of the packaging. There is a date for the printing year and month. If the pack has a more recent date (like late 2013 and early 2014), then it will include the updated cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102924-updated-text-errata-how-to-know-its-there-before-i-buy/?do=findComment&comment=1035474","commentId":1035474,"userName":"entMoot","timestamp":1396420829,"content":"Thanks for passing on that information about the barcode.
