If i exhaust Elrond and Vilya and reveal Stand and Fight do I then get to choose any character in any players discard pile and bring it into play for free (rules for uniqueness allowing)? I would think so but it is a little grey due to the cost of S&F being X and you haven't actually paid anything.\n\nI also assume because the playing or putting into play is a card effect that I can ignore the restriction of only Playing Characters and Attachments during the Planning phase ie if I use the V/Elrond ability to reveal a character or attachment during Questing phase I can put it into play. this opens a world of possibilities that were not there before."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68339-elrond-and-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=666492","commentId":666492,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1343734560,"content":"i honestly dont know the first however i think you are correct on the last- so you could forest snare out of the planning phase for instance\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68339-elrond-and-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=666506","commentId":666506,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1343735581,"content":" I am sure that the answer to your first question is that S&F could be played as though X were 0.  So you could use it to play a 0-cost character from someone's discard pile."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68339-elrond-and-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=666507","commentId":666507,"userName":"Emrad","timestamp":1343735747,"content":"Very interesting questions, I'm looking forward to the answers.\n\nWe might need to contact costumer service on this one as well.\n\nFor what it's worth, In Magic: the Gathering, when a card which has X in its cost is cast for free, X is equal to 0.
