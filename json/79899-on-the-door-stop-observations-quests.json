Cose no any other deck now in metagame not so fast, powerful as this deck. In first 2-3 rounds i  wil play 5-6 aliies, draw half of my deck, lot of attachments on heroes and just run trhough to the end.\n\ni dont know any other deck who can do same effective play. Just look some of my videos on you tube with this deck and you will understand. there is no alternative to answer the power of this deck for now.\n\nDwarves with Dain crazy powerful questing, attacking. there is a lot of recources acceleration: We are not idle, Steward of Gondor, Thorin. Crazy draw: Legacy of Durin( cose most of the cards in deck is dwarves allies is mean: play card to draw card) and Ori and Daemon runes. Lot of Allies and A very good Tale also very helpful to bring more and more every round.\n\nIf you lucky in the first round you can put 3 allies on the table and next round you can draw 2 cards every round and get more recources and play lot of allies every round and all of them +1 will and +1 attack. Gandalf and sneak attack easy to get this combo cose you have a very good draw. Which deck can do alternative? Maybe Elrond with Vilia? yes maybe but Elrond deck is so slow he need much more time to bulid up so dwarves will win the game already at the moment when you start to use Vilia power.\n\nIf they want make a fiar tournaments they need to fix a lot of players cards or we will see Dain decks against other Dain deck tournaments which is kind of boring.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79899-on-the-door-stop-observations-quests/?do=findComment&comment=768493","commentId":768493,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1362068690,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\n \n\nIf they want make a fiar tournaments they need to fix a lot of players cards or we will see Dain decks against other Dain deck tournaments which is kind of boring.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nTo be fair, Dwarrowdelf Cycle was the only proper Cycle we have so far, Since Mirkwood Cycle doesn't have a delux expansion to go with it.\nWhen we get complete HoN + Against the Shadow Cycle in the fall, hopefully Gondorians would be equally strong as Dwarves in a unique way."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79899-on-the-door-stop-observations-quests/?do=findComment&comment=768880","commentId":768880,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1362136364,"content":"Ellareth said:\n\nGlaurung said:\n\n \n\n \n\nIf they want make a fiar tournaments they need to fix a lot of players cards or we will see Dain decks against other Dain deck tournaments which is kind of boring.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTo be fair, Dwarrowdelf Cycle was the only proper Cycle we have so far, Since Mirkwood Cycle doesn't have a delux expansion to go with it.\nWhen we get complete HoN + Against the Shadow Cycle in the fall, hopefully Gondorians would be equally strong as Dwarves in a unique way.\n\n\n\n \n\nquite true…not to get off topic but i'm really looking forward to what hero choices we see for the 3 out of the 4 AtS AP packs that werent already spoiled."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79899-on-the-door-stop-observations-quests/?do=findComment&comment=769106","commentId":769106,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1362176610,"content":"Ellareth said:\n\nTo be fair, Dwarrowdelf Cycle was the only proper Cycle we have so far, Since Mirkwood Cycle doesn't have a delux expansion to go with it.\nWhen we get complete HoN + Against the Shadow Cycle in the fall, hopefully Gondorians would be equally strong as Dwarves in a unique way.\n\n\n\nI don't think they'll be quite as strong, since the two Hobbit SEs are rather dwarf-heavy as well.

The deck is fine, but there are significantly better decks in solo.\n\nThis deck has difficulties with many scenarios. \n\nIt does not cancel treacheries nor shadow effects, does not heal, does not defend well.\n\n \n\nIt has (tons of) difficulties against Escape from Dol-Guldur.\n\nIt has marginal chances against A journey to Rhosgobel (no way to play with locations, to defend the eagle, or to heal it, no way to scry the shadow deck for Athelas)\n\nIt can easily be killed by Return to Moria by the huge threat cards like Gollum's anguish, could also have difficulties with early Attercop\n\nIt sometimes loses The Seventh level with no way to cancel a very nasty chain of treachery/shadow cards\n\nNo heal and no treachery cancel means Sleeping sentry can make Road to Rivendell challenging\n\nIt can have a hard time against the early Smaug attacks in Battle of Laketown\n\nI guess it could be tricky against Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim with the diversity of cards in the deck and the very high draw if you don't leave enough cards for riddles.\n\nIt is not the best deck against the three Heirs of Numenor scenarios - I saw it loose several times against each one of the three scenarios.\n\nI even saw it lose against double Hill troll in Journey Down the Anduin with its high starting threat\n\n \n\nThere may be one or two other scenarios I missed where Thorin's company can be far from reaching a 90% win-rate.\n\n \n\nDwarfs are fairly good and competitive, but not overpowered, and there are a lot of good versions of dwarf decks. But they are certainly not better than anything else. And all the (very many) versions of dwarf decks I have seen and tested are a little behind a few top decks in terms of global solo win-rates.\n\n \n\nBut I agree that they are super strong in multiplayer, with Dain's effect, hardy leadership and Lure of Moria affecting both players' dwarfs - they are maybe the very best deck pair in duo-format.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79899-on-the-door-stop-observations-quests/?do=findComment&comment=769731","commentId":769731,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1362356873,"content":"Fanfan said:\n\nGlaurung said:\n\nscwont said:\n\n \n\nGlaurung said:\n\nYes this dwarfs deck is crazy powerful, even broken.

The deck is fine, but there are significantly better decks in solo.\n\nThis deck has difficulties with many scenarios. \n\nIt does not cancel treacheries nor shadow effects, does not heal, does not defend well.\n\n \n\nIt has (tons of) difficulties against Escape from Dol-Guldur.\n\nIt has marginal chances against A journey to Rhosgobel (no way to play with locations, to defend the eagle, or to heal it, no way to scry the shadow deck for Athelas)\n\nIt can easily be killed by Return to Moria by the huge threat cards like Gollum's anguish, could also have difficulties with early Attercop\n\nIt sometimes loses The Seventh level with no way to cancel a very nasty chain of treachery/shadow cards\n\nNo heal and no treachery cancel means Sleeping sentry can make Road to Rivendell challenging\n\nIt can have a hard time against the early Smaug attacks in Battle of Laketown\n\nI guess it could be tricky against Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim with the diversity of cards in the deck and the very high draw if you don't leave enough cards for riddles.\n\nIt is not the best deck against the three Heirs of Numenor scenarios - I saw it loose several times against each one of the three scenarios.\n\nI even saw it lose against double Hill troll in Journey Down the Anduin with its high starting threat\n\n \n\nThere may be one or two other scenarios I missed where Thorin's company can be far from reaching a 90% win-rate.\n\n \n\nDwarfs are fairly good and competitive, but not overpowered, and there are a lot of good versions of dwarf decks. But they are certainly not better than anything else. And all the (very many) versions of dwarf decks I have seen and tested are a little behind a few top decks in terms of global solo win-rates.\n\n \n\nBut I agree that they are super strong in multiplayer, with Dain's effect, hardy leadership and Lure of Moria affecting both players' dwarfs - they are maybe the very best deck pair in duo-format.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nthe only problem for this deck is Dol-Guldor, Journey to Rhosgobel ( which is easly to manage just add Healing herbs) and Return to Mirkwood. every turn\n\nAll other quest is no problem. I dont care about treachery cose doesn matter what they do if i can play every round 3-4 allies and quest like hell. You need to look my video or try to play with this deck yourself to understand it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79899-on-the-door-stop-observations-quests/?do=findComment&comment=770108","commentId":770108,"userName":"Fanfan","timestamp":1362444119,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nthe only problem for this deck is Dol-Guldor, Journey to Rhosgobel ( which is easly to manage just add Healing herbs) and Return to Mirkwood. every turn\n\nAll other quest is no problem.

You need to look my video or try to play with this deck yourself to understand it.\n\n\n\n \n\nI have played many games with this deck and other variations of dwarf decks. I like it, especially in the fact that some cards that won't see play in other decks are very decent in it, like longbeard orc-slayer, but it really does not compete for the top seat among solo-decks.\n\nFor example, I just had a series of 4 losses against 'Into Ithilien' with it, as it has difficluties with both the strong turn 1 pressure, and it is also quite weak against 'sieges' (like the stage 4 of Into Ithilien). I have already won Ithilien several times with it (being a little luckier with my gandalf+sneak attack connections), but it is certainly not a 'no problem' quest either.\n\n \n\nBy the way, I am thinking about testing some suggestions of small changes to the deck you posted: one Kili could be a good idea. Yes, it is bad when you draw it, but if you draw Fili first, a completely free dwarf from the deck is really worth taking. With two Fili in the deck, this is more likely to happen. Playing two dwarfs for the price of one could be the key against quests that are very aggressive from the start.\n\nI have also thought about Durin's song as a filler. I like its flexibility: it allows you to block with Dain without praying the shadow card won't be a boost, or you can add the little damage that would kill a nasty enemy and not having to face it again next turn. This card is especially good with lure of moria and cram, as you would use the boost twice (for example defense and attack) in the same turn."}]}
