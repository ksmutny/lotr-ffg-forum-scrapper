I believe that there are no resources tokens as yet since it is still the setup phase - to bad because I have \"A Test of Will\" in my initial draw -\n\n \n\nFirst encounter card revealed - Ungoliant's  Spawn, everyone's favorite little lady. \n\n \n\nQuestion. When Revealed: Each character currently committed to a quest get -1 questing until the end of the phase.\n\n \n\nI'm not questing yet, am I.  I'm revealing the first three encounter cards.
