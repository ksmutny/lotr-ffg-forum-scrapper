This month we'll be playing three quests from the LOTR saga. The quests are:\n\n1) Flight to the Ford (Black Riders)\n2) Breaking of the Fellowship (Road Darkens)\n3) Mount Doom (Mountain of Fire)\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n1) Each player will construct a 50+ card deck, then use that exact deck against all three quests. You may use that deck freely against any quests (include the three quests in the league) prior to the run for testing purposes, but you may not use any trial runs for your official results.\n\n2) At least one of the heroes must be from a box with those quests. This means that you must have at least one of Sam, Lore Pippin, Fatty, Tactics Merry, Gandalf, Tom Cotton, and Leadership Eomer.  As the quests all use fellowship Frodo, you must also choose one version of fellowship Frodo to use against all three quests.\n\n3) Your score against each quest will be how much help you need to defeat it, based on the Grace of the Valar variant invented by Seastan. It works like this:\n\nFor each token you have, you can choose to draw a card or give a hero a resource. This happens one at a time, so if I use my first token to draw a card, I see the card before I decide whether to use my second token for a card or a resource. This can be done *anytime* during setup.\n\nThe original variant starts at zero tokens and gains two tokens if you lose quickly (first five turns) and one if you do not -- however, for the purposes of this league I will allow you to start a quest at any number of tokens, and adjust by as many as you want. The only rules for adding/reducing tokens are these:\n\nRule 1) If you lose a quest with X tokens, you cannot play that quest again with X or less tokens.\nRule 2) If you defeat a quest with Y tokens, you cannot play that quest again with Y or more tokens.\n\nSo for example, if I start with six tokens against Flight to the Ford and defeat it, I can play it again with 0-5 tokens. If I then try with three tokens and lose, I can play it again with 4 or 5 tokens. If I try with four and lose, I can play it again with 5 tokens. If I win, my final score for that quest is 5, and if I lose my final score for the quest is 6. (Alternatively, I could've decided that 6 was a good enough score the first time I played it, and just have my final score be 6 without playing again.)\n\nRemember that tokens do not carry over between quests. When playing Mount Doom it does not matter how many tokens I needed to defeat Breaking of the Fellowship.\n\n4) You are not required to publish your deck, but providing a ringsdb link is encouraged (otherwise I may need to ask you for your decklist at the end of the month if required for a tiebreaker). You are required to reveal which Heroes you used (including the fellowship hero, and how many cards in your deck came from outside LOTR Saga, Lost Realm/Angmar cycle and a single core. Do not include outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck itself.\n\nNote: Contracts (from the most recent cycle) are not part of the deck and should not be counted. A Loot Deck (from the Burglar's turn contract) is also not part of the deck and should not be counted. The One Ring or the Messenger of the King ally/hero should also not be counted *unless* your deck uses those cards to reach 50 -- the Master card fetched by the One Ring should be counted. You may follow contract/One Ring setup instructions at the same as hero setup, ignoring Caleb's ruling.\n\n5) Tiebreakers have frequently mattered in this league. Here are the tiebreakers, in order:\n---\n1st) The number of outside cards (i.e. not from LOTR saga, LR/Angmar or a single core) used in the deck. Do not count outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck. Less cards is better.\n\n2nd) The number of heroes specifically from LR/Angmar and LOTR saga. More is better.\n\n3rd) The number of heroes used from this list: Sam, LoPippin, TaMerry, Fatty, Gandalf, LeEomer, Tom Cotton. More is better.\n\n4th) The number of cards in the deck outside LR/Angmar and LOTR saga. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n5th) The number of cards outside Black Riders, Road Darkens, and Mountain of Fire. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n6th) Performance in June's Solo League (if you didn't play or finish June's League, a median performance will be assumed). Whoever did worst wins this tiebreaker.\n---\n\n6) 1st place gets to choose the cycle for Setpember's league, 2nd place gets to choose a quest from that cycle, and 3rd place gets to choose a quest *not* to be used from that cycle. In an effort to expand the diversity of decks used, the last place player will choose an additional cycle that may be used for deckbuilding in September's league. August's cycle (Dwarrowdelf) was chosen by the winner of June's league.\n\n7) Weekly deadlines will at 11:59pm Eastern on the 14th, 21st, and 28th. Only the final deadline really matters for scoring and cannot be extended -- the first two deadlines are only to be included in intermediate standings.\n\nFlight to the Ford: July 14th\nBreaking of the Fellowship: July 21st\nMount Doom: July 28th\n\n8 ) I've created a google spreadsheet for results here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mjdR5YxFj6x5I-3AQquUjn5_uReT4UiA_Jq8fjmE4MU/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mjdR5YxFj6x5I-3AQquUjn5_uReT4UiA_Jq8fjmE4MU/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nTo join the league, merely add your name and information about your deck to the spreadsheet, then enter your results as you have them. Please give a link to your deck if you built or published it on ringsdb, but it is not required.\n\nIf you wish you may run additional decks against the quests and record your results, but only the first entry will be considered for the competition itself."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309514-solo-league-23-lotr-saga-with-lrangmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3957804","commentId":3957804,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1593643541,"content":"Despite mentioning Master cards in the rules boilerplate, they are not allowed in any saga quests and cannot be used this month.  However, I will allow using (non-fellowship) Aragorn as one of your heroes even though it is prohibited for Mount Doom; it violates no uniqueness rules and is only there for theme, and thematically Aragorn *intended* to go with Frodo to Mordor before Frodo slipped away."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309514-solo-league-23-lotr-saga-with-lrangmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3957963","commentId":3957963,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1593686405,"content":"Can we use the spoilered Bond of Friendship Contract from The Fortress of Nurn?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309514-solo-league-23-lotr-saga-with-lrangmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3957997","commentId":3957997,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1593696949,"content":"Yes.  All the cards have been released somewhere by now, so they are free game for anyone to proxy.  My deck is using Bonds of Friendship and Thorongil."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309514-solo-league-23-lotr-saga-with-lrangmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3958115","commentId":3958115,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1593713727,"content":"Question, can we use Smeagol as a hero despite Gollum potentially popping up in mount doom?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309514-solo-league-23-lotr-saga-with-lrangmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3958129","commentId":3958129,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1593716400,"content":"No, it's both prohibited by Shadow in the East rules and has a potential uniqueness conflict issue."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309514-solo-league-23-lotr-saga-with-lrangmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3958162","commentId":3958162,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1593721398,"content":"> 1 hour ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> No, it's both prohibited by Shadow in the East rules and has a potential uniqueness conflict issue.\n\nCurse it!

I quickly established Sam as a defender (hobbit cloak), drew two Gandalfs, one Sneak Attack and Treebeard. After Gandalf, Sam and Merry dispatched the first Fell Rider, I quested on and after letting Bruinen do its work, I was left with two (soon to become three) riders. I Gandalf-damaged two of them in consecutive turns, but that shadow effect kept them dancing around me. When I drew the third, I had Elladan and Elrohir out and Treebeard with two resources. I stalled a turn around the Hobbit monuments to give the hobbits a welcome attack and defense boost, letting the Fell Riders engage me. Hobbits and Ents and Elves striking at two saw me killing two, but one danced off. I was now at six health left on the wound, managed not to draw another nazgul for two turns, killed the last Fell Rider and made it to Rivendell at 4 health on the Evil Wound at Threat 27.\n\nThe deck worked fine. I had Sam with Fast Hitch and Unexpected Courage and Fast Hitch on Merry to reduce my threat. This quest is gold for Pippin since you always engage higher-threat enemies. I did not see any of Frodo's Intuition.

I drew a fantastic starter hand. First round saw me playing Bill the Pony, Resourceful on Merry, Frodo's Intuition for a second Sneak Attack to go with the Gandalf I had, and Arwen for Merry's second planning phase. I also played Out of the Wild to snipe any thoughts on claiming the ring for themselves out of the deck. (I really wanted to get that pesky archer as in one practice run, but no). I then proceeded to draw Black-Feathered Arrow with only one ally in play. Frodo's Intuition saw me off to a head start, clearing quest 1 in three phases, only drawing one enemy (the warrior who had planted his axe in Sam's pony upon arrival). I Sneak Attacked Gandalf in for defense, since the Hobbit Cloak did not show up until next turn.\n\nI picked Orc Hunting as quest, which saw off the steady but small trickle of Uruk Captains and Scouts. Rosie Cotton appeared, to get struck by an arrow. Frodo's choice was stuck in the bottom five, but I managed to find and travel to the location where the encounter deck is searched and shuffled to speed things up. Discarded Frodo's Choice after the third quest phase. By then I had a minstrel, a warden of healing, Arwen, Elrohir and Treebeard up. It felt a bit like the meeting in LotR (the book) between the hobbits and the elves bound for the Grey Havens, travelling secretly in style.

Before spoiling the box, I found BR Frodo better than TRD for the first two quests, but the resource acceleration is so powerful. It really lets you get a head start.

That is how I beat it during practice (oh, and Grim Resolve on Sam with a Good Meal).\n\nFrodo's Intuition ended up saving my hide during my run against Mount Doom, letting me overcome the final Fortitude test and winning me the game. It was a fairly thematic run, with even Gollum coming out when I moved to stage 4 and Wicked Master as treachery in my last turn. It was quite the lucky game in hindsight but still I really had a blast with this contract and some of the new hobbit cards.\n\nHere is the usual playthrough for those interested (and hoping to not have made any mistakes). I never would have imagined to finish this League with 0 tokens, I must say that playing without burdens the Saga quests can be quite easier (also my only other foray into Mount Doom was in 4 players, which is a whole different beast).\n\n \n\nMount Doom\n\n \n\nStarting Hand (after mulligan): Frodo's Intuition, Bywater Shirrif, Tighten Our Belts, The Shirefolk, Red Book of Westmarch, Rally the West\n\nStarting Threat: 28\n\nSetup: Tower of Barad-Dur and Mount Doom in the staging area, add Old Water-Course to the staging area, Brake of Thorns becomes the active location (1 damage to Merry and 1 damage to Pippin\n\n \n\nTurn 1\n\nResource Phase: draw Cautious Halfling\n\nPlanning Phase: play The Shirefolk (Threat downt to 27);

How are you finding yourself in that regard?\n\nPretty good, I recently took a three hunters group consisting of the same hero lineup with slightly different cards through the whole campaign and they performed excellently. There is a ton of ally hate in the game and these guy don’t care. And the other advantage is if you build it with enough generic restricted cards that can go on anyone then with Gandalf’s card draw you can usually get what you need pretty quickly  and I found I was flipping the contract usually by turn 3. And thankfully you get enough of a go questing with all four heroes and just readying Boromir or using Legolas’s readying to have Gandalf ready for any enemies that pop up.\n \n\nIt’s not a perfectly synergistic deck as there are some better restricted cards and some card draw that I cut to keep it more in line with the selected cards for this month but it worked great so far. Mount Doom will be the true challenge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309514-solo-league-23-lotr-saga-with-lrangmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3960725","commentId":3960725,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1594484985,"content":"Just finished Breaking of the Fellowship and here Forth, The Three Hunters really shined.

I was making good progress all the first tries and made it to quest 3, but I was a little short of steam every time. I felt I really had to almost clear the staging area every turn to not get caught in a vicious ally/threat race into the wall. Bad encounter draws and shadow cards did not help in the first three games. The final game I finally drew some lucky cards. Celebrian's Stone on Sam with an Unexpected Courage and Fast Hitch on Merry helped me a lot to make all the Fortitude tests. I drew the Heavy Burden treachery on quest 2 with A Test of Will in hand to save Sam from it. I managed to draw some Gandalfs and Arwen and then drew into the other two Frodo's Intuition. I did not see a lot of enemies until the penultimate round where I was charged by three orcs and Gollum, but I was prepared for it, except that there was another attack from a shadow card, so Pippin bit the dust. By then I had Faramir, Treebeard, Arwen, Bilbo, Rosie Cotton and Gandalf to help clear Mount Doom and still have 15 will for my 9 card fortitude test. I drew 6, and Frodo saved Middle-Earth.\n\nIt felt good. I feel I had decent tries with every game. On my second run I had three \"raise threat by 10\" to spoil the day. I was otherwise in a good spot to travel to Mount Doom but by then I had accumulated a Threat of 85. The deck performed exactly as planned. I had not played Mount Doom enough to properly deck build for it. I did change my Tactics Merry to Spirits Merry during the practice run. I felt that spirit allies were more valuable than Tactics allies at Mount Doom, and as the other scenarios showed, it performed equally good or better during the first two scenarios. If I had stuck with Tactics, I believe I had accrued something like 10 tokens to make it work.\n\nI hope I will have better luck in Khazad-dum."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309514-solo-league-23-lotr-saga-with-lrangmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3961212","commentId":3961212,"userName":"Thanee","timestamp":1594667961,"content":"Mount Doom was a success (good thing, I did a number of test games first to familiarize myself with the quest; lost a few games initially, but then I won two in a row and figured it is time... third time's the charm, after all), the One Ring is no more. 🙂\n\nFinished with 91 Threat (one more round would have been doable).

Merry is of course strong with effective 4 attack from the go, and Sam's response allows action advantage where it is needed, be it help to polish off that tougher enemy, or make an extra defence.\n\nFlight to the Ford was a fairly easy ride in the end - I drew the right cards early enough that I could defend and dispatch the Nazgul as they came out. My questing was a little light, given I was running slightly shallow on allies, and I was threatening to run low on Frodo's life, but Fellowship of the Ring's boost, and a well-timed Ford of Bruinen meant I could clear stage 2 with just the 15 tokens, to win with 4 life force remaining. It was quite refreshing to feel able to take extra burdens for some of the encounter choices - I ended up with three in the deck by the end!\n\nBreaking of the Fellowship was a tougher affair - my first attempt failed as I dawdled too long on Stage 1. As the staging threat grew, I had to quest heavily to get past the stage, only to be ambushed by 3 Uruks on Stage 2 - that would have put me down to 1 hero, so I folded. Attempt 2 was better - I chose The Seat of Amon Hen for stage 3, thinking that the threat and card draw covered my deck's weaknesses. But I struggled with too many locations - I ended up with 3 copies of River Anduin spiking my threat. Then, having shuffled the encounter deck from Wooded Shoreline, Frodo's Choice came up early, so to Stage 4 I went. Now revealing 2 cards per turn, I was quickly overwhelmed. To add insult to injury, I then realised that I had forgotten to use my Valar Token!\n\nSo to attempt 3. I made it to stage 2 within three turns, and just the 1 enemy to deal with. This time I chose Searching the Woods as Stage 3, to counter the locations. This time the deck was kind to me - I revealed lots of locations I could discard via the quest, and I discarded most of the enemies through questing successfully. I was able to keep the staging area clear, and worked my way to the bottom of the encounter deck to Frodo's Choice. Now with a more manageable board state, I was able to slap Fellowship of the Ring on Frodo again, and quest to victory!\n\n \n\nIncidentally, in neither of my successful runs was I ever able to trigger the contract. I'm wondering whether I shouldn't have bothered, and opened the deck up to non-unique allies instead. This would also have let me make better use of some of the allies' enters play effects - certainly Tom Cotton prefers hobbit allies bouncing in and out rather than staying in to make up the numbers.

Heavy and Tired was a bit annoying, as it went to Elrond fairly early in the game (and even though it was during the first stage, it was the second card that was revealed after another treachery, so I could have cancelled it, even had A Test of Will, but no resource. 😅), making him unavailable for Fortitude tests, but the other three managed those pretty well (esp. once Galadriel and Gandalf both had an Unexpected Courage).\n\nBye\nThanee\n\n \n\nEdited July 19 by Thanee"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309514-solo-league-23-lotr-saga-with-lrangmar-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3962996","commentId":3962996,"userName":"Bobbymcbobface","timestamp":1595176602,"content":"I replayed as well, and basically reversed my strategy, questing with allies and testing with heroes.
