I was pretty involved with Warhammer: Invasion, but that game burned me out after the first two cycles -- metagame was just too broken. I really hope this game doesn't do the same.\n\nLooks like I might have to get a third core based on initial card numbers... that really sucks.\n\nCheers!\n\n \n\n(Looking forward to foruming again with players like Toqtamish and WyteFang!)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45409-got-two-coresets-preordered/?do=findComment&comment=455515","commentId":455515,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1303161112,"content":"Glad to see you on board. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45409-got-two-coresets-preordered/?do=findComment&comment=455517","commentId":455517,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1303161272,"content":"Good to see you again Fiendish Devil.

I play AGoT now and again. But I just join in when players at my FLGS. I cba to continue buying when I don't have time to play it that much. This game looks good because the solo play has great appeal for me.\n\nYou should check out the HBO AGoT show. It's pretty good."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45409-got-two-coresets-preordered/?do=findComment&comment=455520","commentId":455520,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1303161585,"content":"Watched it 3 times already. Twice back to back last night. I still buy AGoT but haven't played much but the show makes me wanna play again. So that and LotR will be the two LCG's I collect and play. Can't wait to get my core set so I can actually play this game. Even if it is just solo at first to learn it so I can teach the wife and friends."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45409-got-two-coresets-preordered/?do=findComment&comment=455522","commentId":455522,"userName":"FiendishDevil","timestamp":1303161763,"content":"Three times! haha. I watched it only once so far, like three weeks ago when my office early screened it. I have the first ep saved, will probably go through it again tonight and pick up the juicy details I most likely missed first time around when I was so enthralled at getting to see it early! sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]"}]}
