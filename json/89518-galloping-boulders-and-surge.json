In the absence of any definitive word, we have to go with the FAQ entry that states the keywords only trigger when a card is revealed from the encounter deck. Thus, the \"when revealed\" effect of Galloping Boulders triggers when it is brought back from the discard pile but not the surge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89518-galloping-boulders-and-surge/?do=findComment&comment=854620","commentId":854620,"userName":"face747","timestamp":1377952805,"content":"That was what I thought too and that's how I played it.
