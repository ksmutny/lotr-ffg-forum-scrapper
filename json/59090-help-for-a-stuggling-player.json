A good way to go as you only have one UC is Bilbo for card draw. Dunhere to attack staging area and then use either Elenore or denathor depending on play style. My opinions on Eyowen is well know now, and it is not good.. yes she is a powerful quester, but questing is the least of your problems I would strongly recommend stop using her as fast as possible freeing up a hero slot for more interesting game effects, it will greatly increase your deck building options and IMO allow you to build much more function and reliable decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59090-help-for-a-stuggling-player/?do=findComment&comment=580632","commentId":580632,"userName":"snowyy","timestamp":1326788740,"content":"Thx, thats a good point.

Thanks everyone for their help. using your advice i created a 2 sphere deck using:\n\nBilbo: For double card draw\nDunhere: To attack enemies in the staging area\nTheodred: To allow me to use 'Sneak Attack' and increase my resources, also including Steward of Gondor for triple resources for the attached hero.\n\ni think included lots of cheap cards and ally's.\n\nI used Forest Snare on the starting Hill Giant and then left him while i added counters on the quest, built up an army, used Strider's path to deal with locations and built up my hand with loads of cards. When i was ready i killed the troll then played Protector of Lorien to give Theodred loads of Willpower.\n\nI also used the Sneak Attack - gandalf combo to reduce my threat and block incoming creatures, allowing my army to kill them. I also Stand and Fight for even more Gandalf goodness!\n\nOverall, it was pretty easy and i finished on 18 Threat. Once i managed to Forest Snare the Troll i was pretty safe.\n\nThanks again for all the help, i final belive i have made a decent deck, however tomorrow will tell when i tests it's consistancy and take on the Last of the Core Set Scenario's, Wish me Luck!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59090-help-for-a-stuggling-player/?do=findComment&comment=580721","commentId":580721,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1326801138,"content":"snowyy said:\n\nTheodred: To allow me to use 'Sneak Attack' and increase my resources, also including Steward of Gondor for triple resources for the attached hero.\n\nNote that the hero you give Theodred's ability resource to has to be questing as well.\n\nsnowyy said:\n\nI also Stand and Fight for even more Gandalf goodness!\n\nTsk-tsk, illegal play demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] !
