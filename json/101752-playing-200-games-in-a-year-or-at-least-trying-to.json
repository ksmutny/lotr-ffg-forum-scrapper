Move along.\n\nGAME THREE - OVER THE MISTY MOUNTAINS GRIM (ATTEMPT TWO).\n\nMore succesful, Legolas killed a lot of goblins (and I was glad that I swapped three copies of Mighty Prowess into my Elf heavy deck when all the Gobbos turned up). The final points totals were as follows.\n\nDWARVES Threat Level: 46. Dead Hero Threat: 0. Damage on Surviving Heroes: 4. Victory Points: 3. Rounds (5): 50. Total: 97.\nNON-DWARVES: Threat Level: 49.

Dead Hero Threat: 0. Damage on Surviving Heroes: 8 (all on Beorn, that bear-man can take a truly unfeasable amount of hurt). Victory Points: 0. Rounds (10): 100. Total: 145.\n\nGAME SIX - THE LONELY MOUNTAIN\n\nA game won by nothing more than excessive amounts of jammy luck. By the time I had finished the Elves had hit 50 threat two turns before, the last hero standing was Balin and I would have been fubar'd if I had drawn badly on the last Quest Phase. Points Values were as follows:\nDWARVES Threat Level: 48. Dead Hero Threat: 21. Damage on Surviving Heroes: 5. (Balin had Citadel Plate on him) Victory Points: 10. Rounds (11): 110. Total: 174.\nNON-DWARVES: Failed to complete game.\n\nAs an aside, I have noticed that Legolas has been MVP in pretty much every game (he killed Smaug in Lonely Mountain using the Black Arrow on the turn before the Elves hit 50 threat).

Although he was included for his low Threat Value, Theodred managed to keep the resources flowing whilst ensuring several drawn Quest Phases after the locations started to mount up.

My starting hand is Hasty Stroke, Descendant of Thorandor, A Test Of Will, Song Of Travel, Radagast and The Eagles Are Coming. I choose to mulligan and get Escort From Edoras, A Test Of Will, Gandalf (Core), Vassal of the Windlord, Eagles of the Misty Mountains and Arwen Undomiel. It's not a great starting hand but it will have to do.\n\n \n\nQuest stage 1A tells me to put a Forest Spider and Old Forest Road into the staging area for a total threat of 3.\n\n \n\nThe first thing to happen is all my heroes gain one resource each.(Beregond 1, Eowyn 1, Legolas 1) and draw The Galadhrim's Greetings.\n\n \n\nIn the Planning Phase I play Vassal of the Windlord (Legolas -1/0).\n\n \n\nIn the Quest Phase I exhaust Eowyn for a total Willpower of 4. The Staging draw is Black Forest Bats for a total threat of 4 but Black Forest Bats's ability removes Eowyn from the quest. I lose by 4 and my threat goes up to 32.\n\n \n\nIn the Travel Phase I travel to Old Forest Road and use it's ability to refresh Eowyn.\n\n \n\nIn the Encounter Phase, both Black Forest Bats and Forest Spider have lower Threat ratings than my threat total of 28 so they both attack.\n\n \n\nAs the Combat Phase begins I place a Shadow card on both attackers and the Forest Spider attacks Beregond and the Black Forest Bats attack Eowyn.\n\n \n\nThe Shadow card for the Forest Spider is Necromancer's Pass, no effect meaning that the Forest Spider's attack strength is 3 (thanks to the +1 it gains in it's first turn, no damage done). The Black Forest Bats's shadow card is Mountains Of Mirkwood, no effect. The Bats do one damage to Eowyn, which is stopped by her Defence strength.\n\n \n\nLegolas attacks the Forest Spider for 3 damage, of which the Spider's defence counts for 1, leaving him on 2 Wounds.\n\n \n\nWith that the round ends and I refresh all my cards before putting my threat up to 33.\n\n \n\nAs turn two begins I have nothing in the Staging Area, Old Forest Road is the Active Location and I am engaged with Black Forest Bats & a Forest Spider (with 2 wounds remaining).\n\n \n\nAs the Resource Phase begins I place one resource on all my heroes (Beregond: 2, Eowyn: 2, Legolas: 1) and I draw The Eagles Are Coming. I immediately play it and look at the top 5 cards of my deck, looking for Eagle cards. Out of the 5 cards I only get another Vassal of the Windlord. The other 4 cards are shuffled into my deck.\n\n \n\nIn the Planning Phase I play another Vassal of the Windlord (Beregond -1/1 resource) and Arwen Undomiel (Eowyn -2/0 resources).\n\n \n\nAs the Quest Phase begins I exhaust Eowyn (for 4) and Arwen Undomiel (for 2, Arwen adding +1 defence to one of the Vassal of the Windlords for this turn) for a total Willpower of 6. The Staging draw is Forest Gate, for a total threat of 2. I make 4 progress, using 3 to explore Old Forest Road and put 1 progress on Stage 1B.\n\n \n\nIn the Travel Phase I travel to Forest Gate, allowing me to draw 2 cards. These are Gondorian Shield and Light of Valinor. Both cards will be going straight into play next turn.\n\n \n\nSince there are no Enemies in the Staging Area I go straight to the Combat Phase, adding a shadow card to Black Forest Bats and Forest Spider. The Black Forest Bats engage one of the Vassals of the Windlord and the Forest Bats engage Beregond.\n\n \n\nThe Black Forest Bats shadow card is The Necromancer's Reach for no effect. The attack strength is 1 against the Vassal of the Windlord's augmented 1 defence, no damage.\n\n \n\nThe Forest Spider's shadow card is Caught In A Web, no effect and a nasty Treachery out of play. The Forest Spider does 2 attack, woefully inadequate compared to Beregond's 4 defence\n\n \n\nLegolas attacks the Forest Spider for 3 damage, doing 2 damage to the Spider and killing it. Legolas's ability adds 2 progress to Forest Gate,\n\n \n\nThe other Vassal of the Windlord attacks the Black Forest Bats for 3 damage, killing them but causing the Vassal to the discarded.\n\n \n\nAt that point, with nothing in the staging area or engaged with me I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 34.\n\n \n\nAt the beginning of turn 3 I add one resource to all my heroes (Beregond: 2, Eowyn: 1, Legolas: 2) and draw Eagles of the Misty Mountains.\n\n \n\nIn Planning I play Light Of Valinor (Eowyn -1/0 resources) on Legolas meaning that he can quest without exhausting. He may only quest for 1 but every little helps. I also play Eagle of the Misty Mountains (Beregond -2/0 resources, Legolas -2/0 resources).\n\n \n\nIn the Quest phase I exhaust Eowyn for 4, Legolas quests for 1 without exhausting and Arwen exhausts to quest for 2 (while adding 1 to Beregond's defence for this turn). This gives me a total Willpower of 7.\n\n \n\nThe Staging draw is another Forest Spider for a total Threat of 2, 5 progress is made. 2 goes on Forest Gate, exploring it and 3 goes onto Stage 1B, leaving me with 4 of the needed 8 progress.\n\n \n\nThere are no locations to travel to so I move onto the Encounter Phase where the Forest Spider's threat is low enough for it to engage me.\n\n \n\nThe Spider engages Beregond. The Shadow card is Enchanted Stream for no effect. The Spider attacks for 3 which doesn't penetrate Beregond's 4 defence.\n\n \n\nLegolas and the Vassal of the Windlord attack the Forest Spider for a combined attack of 6, killing it and adding 2 progress to stage 1B. Whereas the Vassal would normally go to the discard pile Eagles of the Misty Mountains's ability means that the Vassal goes under the Eagles adding 1 to the Eagle's attack and defence.\n\n \n\nWith the combat over all my cards refresh and my threat goes up to 35.\n\n \n\nAs turn 4 begins I add a resource to all my heroes (Beregond: 1, Eowyn: 1, Legolas: 1) and draw Radagast. He will be useful when I get the resources to pay for him.\n\n \n\nIn the Planning phase I play Gondorian Shield on Beregond (Beregond -1/0 resources). This card puts Beregond's defence up to 6.\n\n \n\nIn the Quest phase I exhaust Eowyn for 4 and Arwen for 2, adding 1 to Beregond's already prodigious defence for the round. This gives a total Willpower of 6. The Staging draw is Dol Goldur Beastmaster for a total Threat of 2. 4 Progress is made, 2 completes Stage 1B and the other 2 is lost.\n\n \n\nStage 2A has no game text, Stage 2B only needs 2 progress to complete but when it is completed I have to randomly select one of the two Stage 3's.\n\n \n\nThe Dol Goldur Beastmaster's threat is low enough that it engages me.\n\n \n\nIn the Combat Phase I have to add 2 Shadow cards to the Dol Goldur Beastmaster. He engages Beregond. The Shadow cards are Great Forest Web, no effect and Ungolient's Spawn, this is possibly the worst Shadow effect in the quest as it immediately increases my threat to 39 and, unfortunately I have nothing to stop it. After that the Beastmaster's attack is 3 to Beregond's 7 defense.\n\n \n\nLegolas and the Eagles of the Misty Mountains attack the Dol Goldur Beastmaster for 7 attack, killing it. Legolas's ability adds 2 progress to Stage 2B, completing it.\n\n \n\nI shuffled the two stage 3B and drew “Don't Leave The Path”. This is bad as it means that I have to search the Encounter Discard pile for Ungolient's Spawn and put it into my Staging Area. On the up side, all I need to do is defeat it to win the quest. The problem is that it's a tough spider to beat.\n\n \n\nWith the end of the Combat phase I refresh all of my cards and increase my threat to 40.\n\n \n\nTurn Five begins with all my heroes getting a resource (Beregond: 1, Eowyn: 2, Legolas: 2) and I draw a Escort From Edoras.\n\n \n\nIn the Planning Phase I play Gandalf (Beregond -1/0 resources, Eowyn -2/0 resources, Legolas: -2/0 resources) and immediately cause 4 damage to Ungolient's Spawn, leaving it with 5 wounds remaining.\n\n \n\nIn the Quest phase I exhaust Eowyn for 4 and Arwen for 2 (adding 1 to Beregond's defense) for a total of 6 willpower. The Shadow draw is The Necromancer's Reach which does 1 damage to Eowyn and Arwen Undomiel. The Threat total is 3 so I make 3 progress. This is meaningless since the quest only ends when the Ungolient's Spawn dies.\n\n \n\nSince there are no locations in play I go straight to the Encounter Stage. The Ungolient's Spawn immediately engages Beregond. The Shadow card is Necromancer's Pass, no effect. The Ungolient's Spawn does 5 damage against Beregond's 7 defence. No damage.\n\n \n\nIn return, Legolas, The Eagle of the Misty Mountains and Gandalf attack the Spawn for 11 damage, 4 more damage than was needed to kill it and end the game.\n\n \n\n \n\nAs far as the game went everything seemed to go to plan. Playing solo means that I could steadily deal with everything that came my way. All my heroes did what they were there to do admirably and I have no complaints about the deck.\n\n \n\nAs far as scores go, the deck scored as follows:\n\n \n\nCompleted Turns (4): 40.\n\nThreat: 40.\n\nThreat of Dead Heroes: 0.\n\nDamage on Surviving Heroes: 1 (Eowyn).\n\nVictory Points: 0.\n\nTotal; 81.\n\nEdited October 24, 2014 by silverthorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1313075","commentId":1313075,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1414425234,"content":"GAME 138 – JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN\n\nHeroes: Beregond, Eowyn & Legolas\n\n \n\nI'm using the same deck as the last game, but hoping for a Gondorian Shield in my opening hand this time. As per usual my starting threat is twenty eight. My opening hand is Winged Guardian, Vassal of the Windlord, Eagles of the Misty Mountains, Gondorian Shield, Unexpected Courage and Citadel Plate. All in all it's got the card I most needed so I'll keep it.\n\n \n\nStage 1A requires me to play the top card in the encounter deck, namely Driven By Shadow. This has no effect but surges. The replacement is Banks of the Anduin.\n\n \n\nStage 1B tells me to search the encounter deck for a Hill Troll and add it to the staging area. It also says that I cannot pass to stage 2A unless I make eight progress and kill the Hill Troll. The Banks of the Anduin and the Hill Troll make for a total threat of two in the staging area.\n\n \n\nTurn one begins with me adding one resource to all my heroes (Beregond: One, Eowyn: One, Legolas: One) and drawing Light of Valinor. This makes for a top class opening hand.\n\n \n\nIn the Planning phase I spend one resource from Eowyn to play Light of Valinor on Legolas, play Gondorian Shield on Beregond for free and one resource from Legolas to play Vassal of the Windlord. That leaves me with some important cards in play but no resources.\n\n \n\nAs the Quest phase begins I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four willpower and commit Legolas for one willpower, giving me a total of five willpower.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw is The Brown Lands, which is pretty much the worst card I could have hoped for. It is a five threat location which means that the threat total is seven. This means that I lose by two and put my threat up to thirty, meaning that the Hill Troll will be engaging me this turn. I'm so glad I got a Gondorian Shield out.\n\n \n\nIn the Travel phase I travel to the Brown Lands, which allows me to immediately place one progress token on it and explore it. The Brown Lands goes straight into the discard pile.\n\n \n\nDuring the encounter phase I have no choice but to have the Hill Troll engage me.\n\n \n\nThe Hill Troll gains a shadow card and attacks Beregond. The shadow card is Eastern Crows, which adds one to the Hill Troll's attack, boosting it to seven. Against Beregond's six defence it does one damage.\n\n \n\nIn retaliation Legolas and the Vassal attack the Troll for six, doing three damage to it and leaving it with six more wounds. I then discard the Vassal.\n\n \n\nAt the end of turn one I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty one.\n\n \n\nAt the start of turn two I add one resource to all my heroes and draw The Eagles Are Coming.\n\n \n\nAt the start of the Planning phase I play the Eagles are Coming, which allows me to draw the top 5 cards of my deck and add any cards with the Eagle keyword into my hand. The cards are Gandalf (Core), Hasty Stroke, Song of Battle, The Eagles Are Coming and Support of the Eagles. The last two go into my hand and the rest are shuffled back into the deck.\n\n \n\nI then play the new The Eagles Are Coming and draw Black Arrow, Song of Battle, Gwalhir, Feint and Hasty Stroke. Out of those only Gwalhir goes into my hand. The rest are shuffled back into the deck.\n\n \n\nAfter all that I spend the resources on Beregond and Legolas to play Winged Guardian.\n\n \n\nIn the Quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four willpower and commit Legolas for one willpower, giving me a total of five willpower.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw is Dol Goldur Orcs, for a total threat of three. I put the two progress on Stage 1B. The Orcs also do two damage to Legolas.\n\n \n\nIn the Travel phase I travel to Banks of the Anduin.\n\n \n\nIn the encounter phase I am forced to engage the Dol Goldur Orcs.\n\n \n\nGoing on to the combat phase I add a shadow card to Dol Goldur Orcs and Hill Troll. The Hill Troll attacks Beregond, the Shadow card is Evil Strom, no effect and the Troll's six attack does no damage to Beregond.\n\n \n\nThe Dol Goldur Orcs attack the Winged Guardian, the Shadow card is Wargs, boosting the Orcs attack to three, insufficient to break through the Winged Guardian's four defence. I am forced to discard the Guardian.\n\n \n\nLegolas attacks the Dol Goldur Orcs for three damage, killing them and adding two progress to The Banks of the Anduin.\n\n \n\nTo finish off turn two I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty two.\n\n \n\nCommencing turn three I add one resource to all my heroes and draw Radagast.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I spend the two resources on Eowyn to play Unexpected Courage in Beregond.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four willpower and commit Legolas for one willpower, giving me a total of five willpower.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw is Pursued By Shadow, which raises my threat to thirty three. This give a total of zero threat. I put one progress on Banks of the Anduin, exploring it and placing it back on top of the Encounter deck, and put four progress on Stage 1B, putting it on six progress of the eight I need.\n\n \n\nThere are no locations to travel to and no unengaged enemies so the combat phase begins with a shadow card being placed on the Hill Troll before it engages Beregond. The Shadow card is the Banks of the Anduin I put on top of the encounter deck, which has no effect. The six damage the Hill Troll inflicts is matched by Beregond's defence. I then use Unexpected Courage to refresh him.\n\n \n\nBeregond and Legolas attack the Hill Troll for four damage, doing one wound and putting him on four wounds.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty four.\n\n \n\nAt the start of turn four I place one resource on all my heroes and draw Arwen Undomiel.\n\n \n\nDuring planning I spend two resources each from Beregond and Legolas to play Eagles of the Misty Mountains.\n\n \n\nAs usual, in the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four willpower and commit Legolas for one willpower, giving me a total of five willpower.\n\n \n\nThe shadow draw is Necromancers Pass, for a total threat of three. I add two progress to Phase 1B for a total of eight threat. All I need to do to complete it is kill the Hill Troll, something which is turning out to be a problem.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to the Necromancers Pass which means that I have to discard two random cards from my hand. The cards are Gwalhir and Support of the Eagles, which is not good.\n\n \n\nDue to there being no enemies in the staging area, the combat phase starts with Hill Troll gaining a shadow card and attacking Beregond. The Shadow card is Banks of the Anduin for no effect. The Hill Troll's six attack does no damage to Beregond and I use Unexpected Courage to refresh him.\n\n \n\nIn retaliation, Legolas, Beregond and the Eagles of the Misty Mountains attack for six, doing three damage to the Hill Troll and leaving it on seven wounds.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty five.\n\n \n\nAs turn five begins I add a resource to each of my heroes and draw Radagast.\n\n \n\nIn the planning stage I spend the two resources on Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel.\n\n \n\nIn the Quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four and Arwen Undomiel for two, adding one defence to Beregond, then commit Legolas for one making a total willpower of seven.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw is Misty Mountain Goblins for a total threat of two. Of the five progress made, two explores Necromancers Pass and the other three are ignored.\n\n \n\nAs there are no locations in the staging area the encounter phase means that I engage the Misty Mountain Goblins.\n\n \n\nAt the start of the combat phase I add a shadow card to the Hill Troll and the Misty Mountain Goblins who both engage Beregond. The Hill Troll's shadow card is Misty Mountain Goblins, which removes one progress from Stage 1A. The Hill Troll's six attack does no damage compared to Beregond's buffed seven defence.\n\n \n\nI use Unexpected Courage to refresh Beregond then the Misty Mountain Goblins attack him, removing another progress from stage 1A. The shadow card is Gladden Fields, no effect. The Goblin's two attack does nothing.\n\n \n\nLegolas and the Eagles of the Misty Mountains attack the Hill Troll for five attack, doing two damage and finally killing it.\n\n \n\nThe Hill Troll goes into my Victory Display, earning four Victory Points and Legolas adds two progress to stage 1A finishing it.\n\n \n\nMoving on to stage 2B I have to reveal two cards in the quest phase and I can only optionally engage enemies. I have to put sixteen progress on the quest to progress,\n\n \n\nTo end turn five I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty six.\n\n \n\nAt the start of turn six I add one resource to all my heroes and draw Support of the Eagles.\n\n \n\nDuring planning I spend two resources from Beregond to play Citadel Plate on Beregond.\n\n \n\nIn the Quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four and Arwen Undomiel for two, adding one defence to Beregond, then commit Legolas for one making a total willpower of seven.\n\n \n\nThe staging draws are, firstly Eastern Crows for one threat which surges to another Hill Troll (darn it) for one threat. The second draw is another Necromancers Pass for three, giving a threat total of five. Two progress is placed on stage 2B.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to Necromancers Pass, discarding Support of the Eagles and one of the Radagast's in my hand.\n\n \n\nI choose not to optionally engage any enemies so the combat phase begins with me putting a shadow card on Misty Mountain Goblins before they attack Beregond, removing one progress from phase 2B. The shadow card is Massing at Night, which tells me to draw another shadow card. The second shadow card is The Brown Lands for no effect. The Misty Mountain Goblins do two attack against Beregond's seven defence,\n\n \n\nLegolas and the Eagles of the Misty Mountains kill the Misty Mountains Goblins and add two progress to Necromancers Pass, exploring it.\n\n \n\nAt the end of turn six I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to thirty seven.\n\n \n\nAs turn seven begins I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Horn of Gondor.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I spend one resource from Legolas to play the Horn of Gondor on Eowyn and three resources from Legolas and one resource from Eowyn and Beregond to play Radagast. This also empties my hand.\n\n \n\nThe quest phase sees me exhaust and commit Eowyn for four, Arwen Undomiel for two and Radagast for two as well as committing Legolas for one, giving me a total of nine.\n\n \n\nThe staging draws are Evil Storm, which does one damage to all my characters and Treacherous Fog, which has no effect. This means a total threat of two and seven progress going on stage 2B, leaving me on eight of sixteen needed progress.\n\n \n\nIn the encounter phase I optionally engage the Eastern Crows. They gain a shadow card and attack Beregond. The shadow card is another Eastern Crows and makes their attack two against Beregond's buffed seven defence.\n\n \n\nIn return, Legolas attacks and kills the Eastern Crows, adding two progress to stage 2B and the Horn of Gondor adds one resource to Eowyn. The Eastern Crows are shuffled back into the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nAfter refreshing all my cards I increase my threat to thirty eight.\n\n \n\nAt the start of turn eight I add one resource to all my heroes and draw Gandalf (Core).\n\n \n\nIn planning I spend all the resources on Beregond, Eowyn and Legolas to play Gandalf then use his ability to draw three cards, Eagles of the Misty Mountains, Rivendell Blade and Song of Travel. I then spend one resource from Eowyn to play Song of Travel on Legolas.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for four, Arwen Undomiel for two and Radagast for two as well as committing Legolas for one, giving me a total of nine.\n\n \n\nThe staging draws are Wolf Rider for one who surges, Gladden Fields for three and Pursued By Shadow which increases my threat to forty one. I'm really heart-sick of the lack of encounter negation cards I've drawn. The threat total is five meaning that four progress goes on Stage 2B.\n\n \n\nIn the Travel phase I travel to Gladden Fields.\n\n \n\nI decide to optionally engage the Hill Troll, who then gains a shadow card before attacking Beregond. The shadow card is Enchanted Stream, which does nothing. The Hill Troll's six attack is repulsed by Beregond's seven defence.\n\n \n\nIn retaliation Legolas, Eagles of the Misty Mountains and Gandalf attack the Hill Troll for nine, doing seven damage and leaving it with two wounds left.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round all my cards refresh and Gandalf leaves play. My threat then increases (thanks to Gladden Fields) to forty three.\n\n \n\nTurn nine begins with me adding one resource to all my heroes and drawing Song of Battle.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I spend one resource from Legolas to play Rivendell Blade on him, then spend one resource from Beregond to play Song of Battle on Eowyn.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn, Radagast and Arwen Undomiel and commit Legolas for a total of nine willpower. The staging draws are another Gladden Fields for three and Goblin Sniper for two. The total threat is six so three progress explores Gladden Fields.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I don't travel. I then decide not to optionally engage any enemies which brings me to the combat phase. The Hill Troll gains a shadow card and attacks Beregond. The shadow card is The Necromancers Reach for no effect. The Hill Troll's six attack does nothing to Beregond.\n\n \n\nLegolas, using the Rivendell Blade to knock the Hill Troll's defence to one, attacks the Hill Troll with the Eagle of the Misty Mountains and kills it. Legolas's ability adds two progress to stage 2B and completes it as well as adding a resource to Eowyn through Horn of Gondor. The Hill Troll goes into the Victory display and gives me a total of eight victory points.\n\n \n\nStage 3B tells me to add two cards to the staging area Defiance, which does nothing and Treacherous Fog, which makes me discard the Eagles of the Misty Mountains from my hand. I also skip the staging step of the Quest phase from now on. All I have to do is kill the Goblin Sniper and the Wolf Rider to complete the quest.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the combat phase the Goblin Sniper does one damage to Beregond before I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to forty four.\n\n \n\nTurn ten begins with me adding one resource to all my heroes and drawing another Arwen Undomiel.\n\n \n\nSince I already have a Arwen in play I skip the planning and travel stages and exhaust and commit Eowyn (then discard the Arwen in my hand to add one willpower) and Radagast for a total of seven willpower.\n\n \n\nThe threat total in the staging area is still five so no progress is made.\n\n \n\nIn the encounter stage the Wolf Rider engages me.\n\n \n\nIn the combat phase the Wolf Rider gains a shadow card. The Wolf Rider attacks Beregond and the shadow card is Evil Storm for no effect. The Wolf Rider's two attack is insufficient to damage Beregond. In response, Legolas kills him, adding one resource to Eowyn thanks to Horn of Gondor.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the combat round the Goblin Sniper does one damage to Radagast before I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 45.\n\n \n\nAt the start of turn eleven I add one resource to all my heroes and draw Radagast.\n\n \n\nI skip the planning and travel stages and exhaust and commit Eowyn (then discard the Radagast in my hand to add one willpower) and Radagast for a total of seven willpower.\n\n \n\nThe total threat is five so no progress is made. In the encounter phase I engage the Goblin Sniper.\n\n \n\nAfter adding a shadow card, the Goblin Sniper attacks Beregond. The shadow card is Chieftain Ufthak for no effect. The Goblin Sniper does two attack against Beregond's seven defence, then Legolas kills it, ending the game.\n\n \n\nThis quest was a lot tougher than Passage Through Mirkwood, mostly because I was lacking in certain cards. I think I'll stick with this deck when I tackle Escape From Dol Goldur.\n\n \n\nIn the end, the score was:\n\n \n\nCompleted turns (11): 110\n\nThreat: 45\n\nDamage on surviving heroes: 7.\n\nVictory Points: 8.\n\nTotal: 154.\n\nEdited October 28, 2014 by silverthorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1313703","commentId":1313703,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1414456137,"content":"I just realised from watching one of the Cardboard of the Rings game videos on Youtube that I've been playing Horn of Gondor for years :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png].

Although Dol Goldur is one of the more difficult quests I hope the changes might work.\n\n \n\nAs per usual, my starting threat is twenty eight. My starting hand is Bofur, Veteran Axehand, Gondorian Shield, Gondorian Spearman, another Gondorian Spearman and Elrond's Counsel. Despite my not knowing who I'll have available at the start of the game I'll stick with this hand.\n\n \n\nStage 1A tells me to search for the three Objective cards and put them into the staging area. Since all three have Guarded I have to place a card from the top of the Encounter Deck on each of them, Gandalf's Map gains Hummerhorns, Dungeon Torch gains Under the Shadow which has no effect and is discarded and Shadow Key gains Endless Caverns, which increases my threat to twenty nine and surges, adding Eyes of the Forest. It discards the Elrond's Counsel from my hand.\n\n \n\nFlipping to Stage 1B, I have to randomly select one of my heroes to be a captive. The random selection is Beregond, which is pretty much the second worst possible option. Thankfully I put a few good defensive allies into the deck.\n\n \n\nWith a feeling that this is not going to end well, I move on to turn one.\n\n \n\nTurn one begins with me adding one resource to all my heroes and drawing Close Call. In the planning phase I do nothing.\n\n \n\nIn the Quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for a total of four willpower. The Staging draw is Caught In A Web, which only makes things more complicated as it means I have to select a hero to only be able to refresh if I spend two resources from him. This will have to go on Legolas. The threat total is two meaning that two progress goes onto Stage 1B. \n\n \n\nIn the Travel phase I travel to Endless Caverns.\n\n \n\nThe Hummerhorns engagement cost is higher than my threat so it stays in the staging area so I skip the combat phase before refreshing Eowyn and increasing my threat to thirty.\n\n \n\nTurn Two begins with me adding a resource to my heroes and drawing Rivendell Blade, a useless item because it will only play on Legolas.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I spend the two resources on Legolas to play Veteran Axehand.\n\n \n\nIn the Quest phase I again exhaust and commit Eowyn for four willpower. The staging draw is Dungeon Jailer for a total threat of two, meaning that I add two of three progress to Endless Caverns.\n\n \n\nSince both the Dungeon Jailer and the Hummerhorns have higher threat values than mine I don't optionally engage them and after refreshing Eowyn increase my threat to thirty one and end the turn. \n\n \n\nTurn three begins with me adding a resource to my heroes and drawing Black Arrow, another currently useless attachment. \n\n \n\nThe planning phase passes without incident and in the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn again for a total of four willpower. The staging draw is Cavern Guardian who increases my threat to and makes a total threat of four. No progress is made.\n\n \n\nIn the encounter phase the Cavern Guardian's threat is low enough that he engages me, adding a shadow card. The shadow card is Mountains of Mirkwood for no effect as he attacks the Veteran Axehand. His two attack does one of two wounds on the Veteran Axehand and after refreshing my cards and increasing my threat to thirty three the turn ends.\n\n \n\nAs turn four begins I again add one resource to my heroes and draw Elrond's Counsel, a handy card at this point.\n\n \n\nAs the planning phase commences I do nothing so play proceeds to the quest phase where I commit Eowyn for four and play Elrond's Counsel to boost my willpower to five and lower my threat to thirty. The staging draw is Necromancers Pass for a total threat of five. Again,, no progress is made.\n\n \n\nIn the encounter phase the enemies in the staging area have higher threat's than mine so they stay there for now and play proceeds to the combat phase where I add a shadow card to the Cavern Guardian. He attacks the Veteran Axehand and the shadow card is Enchanted Stream for no effect. The two damage is enough to kill the Veteran Axehand before Legolas attacks the Cavern Guardian for three, killing him and adding two progress, one explores the Endless Caverns, releasing the Shadow Key. I increase my threat to thirty two to attach the Shadow Key to Legolas, who will now take a point of damage every turn.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I spend the two resources on Legolas to refresh him then add one wound from the Shadow Key, refresh Eowyn and increase my threat to thirty three whilst hoping that I might draw a Spirit card next turn.\n\n \n\nAs turn five begins I add a resource to my heroes and draw another Gondorian Spearman. It appears that the fates are conspiring against me.\n\n \n\nIn the planning stage I play the Black Arrow and Rivendell Blade on Legolas for a total of one resource from Legolas.\n\n \n\nIn the Quest phase I risk exhausting Eowyn and Legolas for a total of five willpower. The staging draw is another Caught In A Web. This has to go onto Eowyn and it pretty much cripples my heroes. On the something resembling bright side it makes for a total threat of five so I don't actually lose the quest phase.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to Necromancers Pass and discard two random cards, namely Gondorian Spearman and Close Call. Wondering if this game can actually get any worse, I bypass the encounter and combat phases before adding a damage to Legolas and spending two resources from Eowyn to refresh her before increasing my threat to thirty four.\n\n \n\nTurn six begins with me adding a resource to all my heroes and drawing A Test Of Will. While it's a Spirit card it's also a card which is conditional. Regardless I proceed to the Planning phase where I risk spending the two resources on Legolas to play a Gondorian Spearman.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I exhaust and commit Eowyn for a total of four willpower. The staging draw is The Necromancers Reach, which I spend one resource from Eowyn to play A Test Of Will to get rid of. The total threat is two so I make 2 progress, exploring the Necromancer's Pass.\n\n \n\nBypassing the encounter and combat phases, I end turn six by increasing Legolas's damage to three of four wounds and spending two of Eowyn's resources to refresh her before increasing my threat to thirty five.\n\n \n\nAs turn seven commences I add a resource to my heroes and draw Spear of the Citadel. I'm pretty sure I actually put Spirit cards into this fershlugging deck. Regardless, I proceed to planning where nothing happens.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I again exhaust Eowyn for four willpower. The staging draw is another Endless Caverns which increases my threat to thirty six and surges, adding Mountains of Mirkwood to the staging area. The total threat is five, meaning that I have unsuccessfully quested, meaning that Dungeon Jailer's text kicks in shuffling the unclaimed Dungeon Torch back into the encounter deck. \n\n \n\nAt this point, with Legolas about to die at the end of the turn and no light at the end of the tunnel (unless it's a Uruk with a flamethrower). I decided to concede the game. I'm going to build a Leadership/Lore deck and try this baby two-handed since I honestly can't figure out how to beat it single player.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1315946","commentId":1315946,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1414609309,"content":"GAME 140 - ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR\nHeroes: Beravor, Eowyn and Legolas & Aragorn, Bifur and Theodred\n\n \n\nI've give up on the whole writing up the games since it turns a fun half-hour or so into four or five hours of soul-crushing writing.

The shadow card is Wild Men of Dunland for no effect. The attack does 2 damage to Gimli. In return, Gimli, Grima and the Gondorian Spearman attack for 6 (6 attack – 3 defence) doing 3 damage to the Dunland Prowler and killing it.

I then discard Will Of The West to add another willpower for a total of 9.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw is Ill Tidings, which I spend 1 resource from Eowyn to play A Test Of Will and cancel it's effects. The total threat is 0 so 9 progress is made, the first 3 explore the Gap of Rohan and the rest explore Stage 1B.\n\n \n\nStage 2B means that I need to search the encounter deck for a Dunland enemy. I choose Dunland Prowler. I then put 2 time counters on Stage 2B.\n\n \n\nSince there are no locations in the staging area I move to the encounter phase where I optionally engage the Dunland Prowler.\n\n \n\nIn the combat phase a shadow card is added to Dunland Prowler and he attacks Denethor. The shadow card is The King's Road, which does nothing. The Dunland Prowler does no damage (2 attack – 3 defence = 0 damage) and Gimli and the Gondorian Spearman attack, doing 2 damage (5 attack – 3 defence = 2 damage). \n\n \n\nTo end the turn I refresh all my cards and ncrease my threat to 32. I then remove a time counter from stage 2B.\n\n \n\nTURN FOUR\n\n \n\nIn the resource phase I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Hasty Stroke.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I spend 2 resources from Denethor to play Erebor Hammersmith.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I exhaust Denethor (1) then refresh him with Unexpected Courage, Eowyn and discard Will Of The West to boost her willpower (5), Warden of Healing (1), Grima (2) and Erebor Hammersmith (1) for a total of 10 willpower.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw is The King's Road (2). 8 progress is added to Stage 2B.\n\n \n\nIn the Travel phase I am forced to travel to the Kings Road.\n\n \n\nSince there are no enemies in the staging area I proceed directly to the combat phase where I add a shadow card to the Dunland Prowler and declare the Gondorian Spearman as a defender. The Spearman automatically does the fatal 1 damage to the Prowler, killing it and discarding the shadow card, a Dunland Tribesman. I then exhaust Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Gap of Rohan and return it to the top of the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh all my cards, increase my threat to 33 and remove the last time counter from stage 2B, this does the same damage as the number of cards in my hand, namely 5. I put the whole lot on Gimli, then play Close Call to cancel 3 of them but increase my threat to 36. Another 2 time counters go onto stage 2B.\n\n \n\nTURN FIVE\n\n \n\nIn the resource phase I add a resource to all my heroes and draw another Warden of Healing.\n\n \n\nIn the planning stage I spend 2 resources from Eowyn to play Imladris Stargazer, then exhaust her to look at the top 5 cards of my deck and rearrange them.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I exhaust Denethor (1) then refresh him with Unexpected Courage, Eowyn and discard Miner of the Iron Hills (5), Gimli (2), Warden of Healing (1), Grima (2) and Erebor Hammersmith (1) for a total of 12 willpower.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw, unsurprisingly is Gap of Rohan for 2 threat, leaving me making 10 progress. The first 5 explore the Kings Road and the next 5 go onto stage 2B leaving me with 1 progress to make.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to the Gap of Rohan, I ignore the encounter phase and, at the end of the combat phase exhaust Denethor to see the top card of the encounter deck, Dunland Raider, who goes to the bottom of the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn, I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 34 before removing a time counter from Stage 2B.\n\n \n\nTURN FIVE\n\n \n\nTo begin with, I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Henamarth Riversong.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I spend 1 resource from Denethor to play Henamarth Riversong, I then exhaust Imladris Stargazer to rearrange the top 5 cards in my deck and exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the deck, Dunlanding Bandit.\n\n \n\nKnowing what is coming my way, I commit Eowyn (4) and Grima (2) for a total of 6 willpower. \n\n \n\nPredictably the staging draw is Dunlanding Bandit for a total threat of 2. I make 4 progress, the first 3 explore the Gap of Rohan and the last one explores stage 2B.\n\n \n\nStage 3 tells me to search the deck for a Dunland enemy, once again I pick the Dunland Prowler and put 3 time counters on stage 3B.\n\n \n\nIn the encounter phase I am forced to engage both of the enemies in the staging area.\n\n \n\nAs combat begins, both enemies gain a shadow card before the Dunlanding Bandit attacks Denethor. His shadow card has no effect and the attack does 1 damage to Denethor. Unexpected Courage exhausts to ready him in time for the next attack from the Dunland Prowler. His shadow card also has no effect and the attack does no damage.\n\n \n\nIn response, Gimli attacks the Dunlanding Bandit for 6, killing it.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn all my cards refresh and my threat increases to 35. I then remove a time counter from stage 3B.\n\n \n\nTURN SIX\n\n \n\nTo begin the turn I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Arwen Undomiel.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I spend 2 resources from Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel, spend 2 resources from Denethor to play Warden of Healing and exhaust Denthor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, a Dunland Tribesman who goes to the bottom of the encounter deck. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck, a Dunlending Bandit.\n\n \n\nIn the Quest phase I commit Eowyn (4), Arwen Undomiel (2) adding her bonus to Gondorian Spearman and Grima (2), both Wardens of Healing (2) and Erebor Hammersmith (1) for a total willpower of 11.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw is Dunlending Bandit for 2 threat, meaning that 9 progress is made towards stage 3B. \n\n \n\nAfter bypassing the travel phase the encounter phase sees me engaged by the Dunlending Bandit.\n\n \n\nIn the combat phase shadow cards are dealt and the Dunlending Bandit attacks the Gondorian Spearman, suffering 1 wound before he kills the Spearman.\n\n \n\nThe Dunland Prowler attacks Denethor, doing no damage. In return, Gimli kills the Dunlending Bandit. At the end of the phase I exhaust Imladris Stargazer to rearrange the top 5 cards of my deck.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 35 and remove a time counter from stage 3B.\n\n \n\nTURN SEVEN\n\n \n\nTo begin I add a resource to all my heroes then draw Dwarrowdelf Axe (finally a smegging Tactics card).\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I spend 1 of Gimli's 6 resources to play Dwarrowdelf Axe on him. I then exhaust Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck.a Dunland Berserker who goes straight to the bottom of the encounter deck. I then exhaust Unexpected Courage to refresh him before exhausting Henamarth Riversong to look at the new top card, Wild Men Of Dunland. I'm glad I didn't spend the resource on Eowyn.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn (4), Arwen Undomiel (2), putting her bonus on Denethor and Grima (2) for a total threat of 8.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw is Wild Men of Dunland which surges before I spend 1 resource from Eowyn to play A Test Of Will and negate it. The surge card is Pillaging and Burning which makes me draw Gondorian Shield and raises my threat to 37. the threat total is 0 so 8 progress goes onto stage 3B, enough to explore it.\n\n \n\nAll I have to do is kill the Dunland Prowler and the quest's complete. Going into the combat phase I add a shadow card to the Prowler before he attacks Denethor. The shadow card is Dunland Chieftain for no effect and the Prowler does no damage to Denethor before Gimli wallops him for 7 damage, killing him and winning the quest.\n\n \n\nIn the end the score was as follows:\n\n \n\nTurns (7): 70\n\nThreat: 37\n\nDamage on heroes: 5 (1 on Denethor, 4 on Gimli).\n\nVP: 1 (the Islet).\n\nTotal: 111.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, Denethor is nasty after a readying effect is played on him. The ability to potentially delay nasty encounter cards is excessively useful and his high defence is a bonus. The other heroes did their assigned tasks well and the quest was a slog but never seemed insurmountable. All in all a nice first quest for this deck.\n\nEdited November 25, 2014 by silverthorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1346244","commentId":1346244,"userName":"haslo","timestamp":1416931997,"content":"I joined a 100 game play challenge with LotR LCG, about a month ago, and completed it two days ago :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Here's the Spreadsheet I use to track my plays (in German, with some statistics):\n\n \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FXc6V-Mg5XzPV_UIz-5rRFdB29AyCr6D2_1psmhtIBE/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FXc6V-Mg5XzPV_UIz-5rRFdB29AyCr6D2_1psmhtIBE/edit?usp=sharing]\n\n \n\nI also have a blog on BGG:\n\n \n\nhttps://www.boardgamegeek.com/blog/3969 [https://www.boardgamegeek.com/blog/3969]\n\n \n\nI think I might start to track the deck type (like \"dwarf\", \"eagles\" etc.) and heroes I use, too; I only recorded spheres to date."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1346608","commentId":1346608,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1416946837,"content":"100 games in a month, that's impressive. \n\n\n \n\n\nGAME 155 – PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD\n\n\n \n\n\nSET-UP\n\n\nAs will become standard for this run through the scenarios my heroes are Beregond, Eowyn and Legolas for a starting threat of 28. My starting hand is A Test Of Will, Defender of Rammas, Feint, Galadhon Archer, Song of Travel and Spear of the Citadel. I'll keep this hand.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe quest set-up is normal for this quest, Forest Spider and Old Forest Gate go in the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN ONE\n\n\n \n\n\nTo start off I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Black Arrow. In the planning phase I play Black Arrow on Legolas and Spear of the Citadel on Beregond before spending a resource each from Beregond and Legolas to play Galadhon Archer. Her ability does 1 point of damage on the Forest Spider.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn for 4 willpower. The staging draw is Mountains of Mirkwood for a total 5 threat. My threat value increases to 29.\n\n\n \n\n\nin the travel phase I travel to Old Forest Road, using it's ability to refresh Eowyn.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter engaging the Forest Spider in the encounter phase the Spider gains a shadow card and attacks Beregond whose Spear of the Citadel does another damage to it. The shadow card is Black Forest Bats and has no effect and the Forest Spider's 3 attack does nothing to Beregond's 4 defence.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn retaliation Legolas attacks for 3, killing the Forest Spider and adding 2 progress to Old Forest Road.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the round I refresh my cards and increase my threat to 30.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN TWO\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding a resource to all my heroes and drawing Gondorian Shield I attach the Gondorian Shield to Beregond the spend a resource from Eowyn to play Song of Travel on Legolas before I spend a resource from Legolas and Beregond to play Defender of Rammas.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn for 4 willpower while the staging draw is another Forest Spider for a total of 4 threat. No progress is made.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter skipping the travel phase I engage the Forest Spider and it attacks Beregond, then takes 1 wound because of Beregond's Spear of the Citadel. The Forest Spider's attack of 3 does nothing with Beregond's defence at 6.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn return, Legolas and the Galadhon Archer attack for 5, killing the Forest Spider then adding 1 progress to explore the Old Forest Road before adding 1 progress to stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the round I refresh my cards then increase my threat to 31.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN THREE\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding a resource to all my heroes I draw Gondorian Spearman. With the new resource I spend a resource from Legolas and Beregond to play Gondorian Spearman.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring Questing I commit Eowyn for 4 willpower and draw another Forest Spider for a total of 4 threat (I did shuffle the encounter deck). No progress is made again.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the travel phase I travel to the Mountains of Mirkwood, drawing the top card of the encounter deck, a King Spider. In the encounter phase I engage both spiders, exhausting the Defender of Rammas and proceed to the combat phase.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe King Spider engages Beregond, suffering 1 wound from his Spear of the Citadel while the Forest Spider attacks Gondorian Spearman and also takes 1 wound. The King Spider's 3 attack does nothing to Beregond and the Forest Spider gets a boost of 1 extra attack from Dol Goldur Orcs and overkills the Gondorian Spearman.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn return, Legolas attacks the King Spider for 3, killing it and adding 2 progress to Mountains of Mirkwood. The Galadhon Archer attacks for 2, doing 1 damage to the Forest Spider.\n\n\n \n\n\nWith a empty staging area I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 32.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN FOUR\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding resources I draw Close Call (I did put Spirit cards into the deck) and skip planning. In the quest phase I commit Eowyn for 4 willpower and draw Old Forest Road for 1 threat. I add1 progress to explore Mountains of Mirkwood and 2 progress goes onto Stage 1B. Thanks to Mountains of Mirkwood I can search the top 5 cards of my deck and put 1 into my hand. I choose Ethir Swordsman and shuffle the others into my deck.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the travel phase I travel to Old Forest Road, refreshing Eowyn.\n\n\n \n\n\nSince I have a empty staging area I proceed to the combat phase where the Forest Spider attacks Beregond and suffers a third wound from Beregond's Spear of the Citadel before his 2 attack does nothing to the Gondorian defensive behemoth.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn the counter-attack Legolas kills the Forest Spider and adds 2 progress to Old Forest Road before I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN FIVE\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding resources and drawing Boromir I spend 2 resources from Eowyn to play Ethir Swordsman and 2 resources each from Beregond and Legolas to play Boromir.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring Questing I commit Eowyn and the Ethir Swordsman for a total of 6 willpower before drawing Dol Goldur Orcs for a total of 2 threat. I would have had to take 2 damage on Eowyn but I play Close Call to increase my threat to 35 instead. 1 progress explores the Old Forest Road and the other 3 progress goes onto stage 1B leaving me with 2 progress left.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the encounter phase I engage the Dol Goldur Orcs who proceed to attack Beregond, taking 1 damage from Beregond's sharp pointy stick and doing nothing to the Gondor hero. In return, Legolas attacks and kills the Dol Goldur Orcs, his ability adding the 2 progress needed to proceed to stage 2.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the round I refresh everything and increase my threat to 36.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN SIX\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding resources I draw Guthlaf before spending 1 resource each from Beregond and Legolas to play Guthlaf.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Ethir Swordsman and Guthlaf for a total willpower of 7. Against this I draw East Bight Patrol for a total of 3. Of the 4 progress I made, 2 explored Stage 2B and the rest is lost. I then randomly select a Stage 3. I hit lucky, drawing Beorn's Path.\n\n\n \n\n\nSince there are no locations in the staging area I proceed to the encounter phase where I have to engage the East Bight Patrol.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe East Bight Patrol attacks Beregond, taking 1 damage and doing nothing to Beregond. Again, Legolas attacks and kills the East Bight Patrol, adding 2 of 10 progress to stage 3B before I refresh everything and increase my threat to 37.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN SEVEN\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding resources I draw Core Gandalf before again skipping planning.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Ethir Swordsman and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. Against this I draw Hummerhorns for a total of 1 threat. 6 progress goes onto stage 3B for a total of 8 of 10 progress.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the encounter phase I ignore the Hummerhorns and skip the combat phase before refreshing my cards and increasing my threat to 38.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN EIGHT\n\n\nAfter adding resources I draw Galadriel's Handmaiden before spending 2 resources from Eowyn to play Galadriel's Handmaiden, reducing my threat to 37, then spend 1 resource from Eowyn and 2 resources each from Beregond and Legolas to play Gandalf. I then use his ability to do 4 damage to the Hummerhorns, killing them.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Ethir Swordsman, Guthlaf, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Gandalf for a impressive 13 willpower. Against this I draw The Necromancer's Reach which does 1 damage to Eowyn, Guthlaf and Gandalf and outright kills Ethir Swordsman and Galadriel's Handmaiden. My reduced willpower is 9 against the staging area's 0 meaning that I add 9 progress stage 3B, exploring it and winning the game.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn conclusion this deck works well against arguably the easiest quest in the game. Beregond is ridiculous once you get his shield and stick on him and Legolas didn't get a chance to do much more than kill enemies with his basic abilities after I put a few toys into the deck for him to use. Eowyn did what Eowyn always does, quested like her life depended on it and Boromir pretty much did nothing at all. He may be card box bound if he doesn't at least do something in the next couple of games.\n\n\n \n\n\nMy score was as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\nCompleted Turns (8): 80\n\n\nThreat: 37\n\n\nWounds: 1 (on Eowyn due to the last turn Necromancer's Reach).\n\n\nVP: 0\n\n\nTotal: 117.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1347650","commentId":1347650,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1417023287,"content":"GAME 156 – JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN\n\n \n\nAs per usual my heroes are Beregond, Eowyn and Legolas for a total starting threat of 28. My initial starting hand is Feint, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Close Call, another Close Call, Guthlaf and another Galadriel's Handmaiden. Due to the lack of a Gondorian Shield I mulligan, drawing Unexpected Courage, Arwen Undomiel, Song of Travel, Hasty Stroke, Horn of Gondor and Citadel Plate. This is probably a worse hand than the one I mulligan'd but I'll have to hope it works.\n\n \n\nStage 1A tells me to draw the top card of the encounter deck. It is Banks of the Anduin, a 1 threat location. Stage 1B tells me to search the encounter deck for a Hill Troll and put it into the staging area. This is not good since it will attack me in turn three at the latest. \n\n \n\nTURN ONE\n\nAfter adding a resource to all my heroes and drawing Feint (which will come in handy when the Hill Troll engages me) I spend 1 resource from Beregond to play Song of Travel on Legolas then spent 1 resource each from Legolas and Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel.\n\n \n\nProceeding to the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Arwen (adding the defence bonus to Beregond) for a total willpower of 6.\n\n \n\nAgainst that the staging draw is Eastern Crows which surges to Gladden Fields for a total threat of 6. No progress is made.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to the Gladden Fields, \n\n \n\nAfter optionally engaging the Eastern Crows they attack Beregond. The shadow card has no effect and they do no damage. Legolas then attacks the Eastern Crows and easily kills them, adding 2 of 3 progress to the Gladden Fields.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refresh all my cards and (thanks to Gladden Fields) increase my threat to 30.\n\n \n\nTURN TWO\n\n \n\nAs usual I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Black Arrow, a handy card considering who will be attacking this turn.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I play the Black Arrow on Legolas then spend a resource from Legolas and Beregond to play Plate Armour on Beregond.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Arwen (putting her defence bonus on Beregond) for a total of 6 willpower. Against that the 2 threat in the staging area is bolstered by Pursued By Shadow, a nasty 0 threat treachery which increases my threat to 32. The total threat is 2, which means that 4 progress is made. 1 progress explores Gladden Fields and nets me 3 VP before the next 3 progress goes onto stage 1B.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to the Banks of the Anduin, then the Hill Troll engages me in the encounter phase.\n\n \n\nThe Hill Troll attacks Beregond, the Shadow card, Massing At Night adds another shadow card, which has no effect before the Hill Troll's 6 attack does 1 wound to Beregond.\n\n \n\nIn response, Legolas attacks the Hill Troll, using the Black Arrow to boost his attack to 8, He does 5 of 9 damage to the Hill Troll and gains another VP from the Black Arrow.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn my cards refresh and my threat increases to 33.\n\n \n\nTURN THREE\n\n \n\nAfter adding resources and drawing Defender of Rammas I spend 2 resources from Eowyn to play Unexpected Courage on Beregond and 1 resource from Beregond to play Horn of Gondor on Eowyn.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Arwen (adding the defence bonus to Beregond) for a total willpower of 6. Against this the empty staging area is bolstered by The Brown Lands, a 5 threat location which means that I only make 1 of 3 progress towards Banks of the Anduin.\n\n \n\nI then skip the travel and encounter phases and move to the combat phase where the Hill Troll attacks Beregond again. With a useless shadow card, the Troll does 1 more damage to Beregond, who exhausts Unexpected Courage to refresh.\n\n \n\nLegolas and Beregond then attack the Hill Troll, doing another damage to it before all my cards refresh and I increase my threat to 34.\n\n \n\nTURN FOUR\n\n \n\nAfter adding resources I draw Boromir before spending 1 resource each from Beregond and Legolas to play Defender from Rammas.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Arwen (adding the defence bonus to Beregond) for a total willpower of 6. Against this I draw Evil Storm and hit lucky that my threat is 1 below the threshold for the card to effect me. The total threat is 5, meaning that another progress is made Banks of the Anduin.\n\n \n\nAgain skipping the travel and encounter phases the Hill Troll attacks Beregond again but I spend 1 resource from Legolas to play Feint and stop the attack. Beregond, Legolas and the Defender from Rammas attack the Hill Troll doing the 2 damage needed to kill it and adding another 4 VP as well as making 2 more progress. 1 progress explores Banks of the Anduin and returns it to the top of the encounter deck and 1 progress goes onto Stage 1B.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh everything then increase my threat to 35.\n\n \n\nTURN FIVE\n\n \n\nAfter adding resources I draw Rivendell Blade before spending 1 resource from Legolas to play the Rivendell Blade on him.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Legolas and Arwen (adding the defence bonus to Beregond) for a total willpower of 7. Against this I draw Banks of the Anduin for a total threat of 6. 1 progress goes onto stage 1B.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to and automatically explore The Brown Lands.\n\n \n\nSkipping the encounter and combat phases I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 36.\n\n \n\nTURN SIX\n\n \n\nAfter adding resources I draw Guthlaf before spending 1 resource each from Legolas and Beregond to pay for Guthlaf.\n\n \n\nIn the questing phase I commit Eowyn, Arwen (adding her defence bonus to Beregond, as usual) and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. In opposition I draw Misty Mountain Goblins for a total of 3 threat. 5 progress is made, 3 of which finally explores Stage 1B.\n\n \n\nStage 2B is different, I have to draw 2 cards a turn and can only optionally engage enemies. I also have to make 16 progress to proceed to stage 3.\n\n \n\nWith that in mind I use the travel phase to travel to Banks of the Anduin and use the encounter phase to engage the Misty Mountain Goblins. They would have stripped a progress if they had arrived later but now it's less dangerous.\n\n \n\nThe Misty Mountain Goblins attack Beregond and do nothing to him. In return, Legolas attacks and kills them, adding 2 of 3 progress onto Banks of the Anduin.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn, my cards refresh and my threat increases to 37.\n\n \n\nTURN SEVEN\n\n \n\nAfter adding resources and drawing The Galadhrim's Greeting I spend 3 resources from Eowyn to play The Galadhrim's Greeting and reduce my threat to 31.\n\n \n\nIn the questing phase I commit Eowyn, Arwen (adding her defence bonus to Beregond, as usual) and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. On the other hand I draw Goblin Sniper and The Necromancer's Reach which does 1 damage to Eowyn, Arwen and Guthlaf. Despite this I quest for 5 progress. 1 explores Banks of the Anduin and I gain 4 of 16 progress towards stage 2B. Banks of the Anduin goes to the top of the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nI skip the travel phase and opt to engage the Goblin Sniper who attacks Beregond. His attack does nothing and Legolas kills the Sniper to gain a total of 6 of 16 progress towards stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh everything and increase my threat to 32.\n\n \n\nTURN EIGHT\n\n \n\nAfter adding resources I draw another Defender of Rammas. In the planning stage I spend 2 resources each from Beregond and Legolas to pay for Boromir.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Arwen (adding her bonus to Beregond), Boromir and Guthlaf for a total of 8 willpower.  The staging cards were The East Bight and Enchanted Stream for a total threat of 3, meaning that another 5 progress went onto Stage 1B putting me on 11 of 16 progress. I then travelled to the East Bight,\n\n \n\nI finally refreshed and increased my threat to 33.\n\n \n\nTURN NINE\n\n \n\nAfter adding resources I draw another Arwen Undomiel then spend 1 resource each from Beregond and Legolas to play another Defender of Rammas.\n\n \n\nn the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Arwen (adding her bonus to Beregond), Boromir and Guthlaf for a total of 8 willpower. The staging cards are another The Necromancer's Reach which does 1 damage to Eowyn and Boromir (readying him) and outright kills Arwen Undomiel and Guthlaf (netting Eowyn 2 more resources). The next card is Dol Goldur Orcs. After the losses I suffered my total willpower is 5 against 4 threat. 1 progress is added to The East Bight.\n\n \n\nIn the Encounter phase I engage the Dol Goldur Orcs then kill one of my Defenders of Rammas (adding a resource to Eowyn).. The Dol Goldur Orcs then attack Beregond. Even with Wargs as a shadow card they do no damage\n\n \n\nIn return, Legolas attacks and kills the Dol Goldur Orcs, adding 2 more progress to The East Bight.\n\n \n\nWith my ranks reduced I refresh everything before increasing my threat to 34.\n\n \n\nTURN TEN\n\n \n\nAfter adding resources I draw Song of Battle before spending 2 resources from Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel again.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Boromir and Arwen (adding her defence buff to Beregond) for a total of 7 willpower. The staging cards are Dol Goldur Orcs again and Pursued By Shadow, which  increases my threat to 37. The total threat is 4, which means I make 3 progress, enough to explore the East Bight.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to the Enchanted Stream before using the encounter phase to engage the Dol Goldur Orcs, which kills the other Defender of Rammas (adding a resource to Eowyn).. The Dol Goldur Orcs attack Beregond and, even with a attack buff do nothing to him. In response Legolas does his thing and kills them to explore the Enchanted Stream.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh everything and increase my threat to 38.\n\n \n\nTURN ELEVEN\n\n \n\nGeez, anyway. After adding resources I draw Core Gandalf. I then spend 1 resource from Beregond and 2 resources each from Eowyn and Legolas to play Gandalf. I then use his ability to draw 3 cards, namely two Close Calls and a Gondorian Spearman. I then spend 2 resources from Beregond to play Gondorian Spearman.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Arwen Undomiel (who buffs Beregond), Boromir and Gandalf for a total of 11 willpower. The staging draws are Gladden Fields and Banks of the Anduin for a total threat of 4. 7 progress goes onto stage 2B, completing it.\n\n \n\nStage 3B makes me draw 2 encounter cards, Misty Mountain Goblins and Necromancers Pass. I basically need to kill the Misty Mountain Goblins to win the quest.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to the Gladden Fields before optionally engaging the Misty Mountain Goblins who attack Beregond. Their shadow card does nothing and the Goblins bounce off Beregond's defence. In response Legolas attacks and kills the Goblins to finally finish the quest.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, once again my heroes did what they were supposed to do and everything went according to plan, if a little slowly. The score was as follows:\n\n \n\nTurns (11):  110\n\nThreat: 38\n\nDamage: 4\n\nVP: 8\n\nTotal Score: 144\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1348096","commentId":1348096,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1417045045,"content":"GAME 157 – ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR\n\n\n \n\n\nFor this, probably the most difficult quest in the game I use my standard Beregond, Eowyn and Legolas combo giving me a starting threat of 28. My starting hand is Defender of Rammas, Gandalf (Core), Citadel Plate, Guthlaf, Galadhon Archer and Spear of the Citadel. Since I have no idea what hero will be captured I keep this one.\n\n\n \n\n\nStage 1A tells me to place the three objective cards, guarded into the staging area; Dungeon Torch is guarded by Enchanted Stream, Shadow Key guarded by Dol Goldur Beastmaster and Gandalf's Map guarded by Driven By Shadow. This is only getting worse.\n\n\n \n\n\nStage 1B makes things even worse by having one of my heroes be captured; after random selection processes I wind up with Legolas as the captive, which is all kinds of bad. Guessing that this will end badly and quickly I proceed onwards.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN ONE\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding resources I draw Galadriel's Handmaiden before I play a discounted Spear of the Citadel on Beregond.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn for 4 willpower. The staging draw is Iron Shackles, which goes on top of my deck but adds no threat. Since the threat total is 4 I add no progress.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the travel phase I travel to Enchanted Stream with Dungeon Torch.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the encounter phase I do not optionally engage anyone so there is no combat phase and I end the turn by refreshing my cards and increasing my threat to 29.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN TWO\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding resources I discard Iron Shackles instead of drawing a card. I then spend 2 resources from Beregond to play Galadhon Archer and add 1 wound to Dol Goldur Beastmaster. I then spend 2 resources from Eowyn to play Galadriel's Handmaiden which reduces my threat back to 28.\n\n\n \n\n\nin the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Galadriel's Handmaiden for 6 willpower. The staging draw is Dol Goldur Orcs for a total of 4 threat. 2 progress is made, which explored Enchanted Stream and means that I increase my threat back to 30 and attach it to Beregond.\n\n\n \n\n\nSkipping the travel phase I optionally engage the Dol Goldur Orcs who attack Beregond and take 1 of 3 wounds from the Spear of the Citadel. The Orcs attack of 2 bounces off Beregond's 4 defence before the Galadhon Archer kills them with her 2 attack.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh everything and increase my threat to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN THREE\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding resources I draw Song of Battle and proceed to the planning stage where I do nothing.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn and Galadriel's Handmaiden for 6 willpower. The staging draw is Eyes of the Forest which forces me to discard nothing from my hand. The 2 total threat means that I make 4 of 9 progress towards stage 2.\n\n\n \n\n\nAgain skipping the travel phase I proceed to the encounter phase where I risk engaging the Dol Goldur Beastmaster. He then attacks Beregond and suffers a wound from Beregond's Spear, the Cavern Guardian shadow card returning Dungeon Torch to the staging area before Dol Goldur Beastmaster does no damage to Beregond.\n\n\n \n\n\nGaladhon Archer then attacks the Dol Goldur Beastmaster, doing another point of damage to him.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo end the round I refresh my cards and put my threat up to 34.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN FOUR\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding resources I draw Boromir before I spend 2 resources from Beregond to play Guthlaf.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I exhaust Eowyn, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. Against this I draw Hummerhorns for 1 threat. The 6 progress is enough to explore Stage 1B but I need to get one of the Objective cards to finish the stage.\n\n\n \n\n\nI then skip travel and encounter, proceeding directly to the combat phase where the Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacks Beregond, taking another wound from Beregond's beating stick. The two shadow cards are useless and the Beastmaster does no damage. To deliver the coup de grace the Galadhon Archer, who has really delivered the goods so far this game, does the last point of damage to kill the Dol Goldur Beastmaster before I attach Gandalf's Map to Eowyn, raising my threat to 36 and moving on to stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the round I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 37.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN FIVE\n\n\n \n\n\nTo start off with I add a resource to my heroes and draw Gondorian Spearman before spending 1 resource from Eowyn to play Song Of Battle on her.\n\n\n \n\n\nn the quest phase I exhaust Eowyn, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. Against this I draw Mountains of Mirkwood for a total of 3 threat. Of the 4 progress I make, the first progress realeases Legolas with 1 wound on him and adds the Nazgul of Dol Goldur to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the travel phase I travel to Mountains of Mirkwood and draw Under the Shadow, which has no effect.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the encounter phase I risk engaging the Nazgul of Dol Goldur, who attacks Beregond, gaining a wound from Beregond's spear. Luckily there is no shadow effect and the Nazgul does no damage to Beregond. In return Legolas and the Galadhon Archer do 2 more damage to the Nazgul.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the end of the round I refresh everyone and increase my threat to 38.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN SIX\n\n\n \n\n\nTo start I add a resource to my heroes and draw Rivendell Blade before I spend 1 resource from Legolas to play the Rivendell Blade on him then spend 2 resources from Beregond and 3 from Eowyn to play Core Gandalf, using his ability to kill the Hummerhorns and gain 5 VP.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I exhaust Eowyn and Galadriel's Handmaiden for a total of 6 willpower. Against that I draw Necromancer's Pass for 2 threat. Of the 4 progress I make, 3 explores Mountains of Mirkwood, allowing me to take another Galadhon Archer into my hand before the last progress goes on stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the travel phase I travel to the Necromancer's Pass, discarding Defender of Rammas and Citadel Plate.\n\n\n \n\n\nSkipping the encounter phase I proceed to combat where the Nazgul attacks Beregond again and takes another point of damage from Beregond's Spear. Luckily there is no shadow effect and Beregond takes no damage. In return Legolas, Galadhon Archer, Guthlaf and Gandalf attack for a total of 10 damage which (with Legolas's Rivendell Blade) is more than enough to kill the Nazgul of Dol Goldur.\n\n\n \n\n\nBuoyed up by killing the Nazgul, I increase my threat to 39 and discard Gandalf.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN SEVEN\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter adding resources I draw Elven Mail before I spend a resource from Legolas and Beregond to play Galadhon Archer.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. The staging draw is Caught In A Web, which I attach to Legolas for a total of 0 threat. The first 2 progress explores Necromancer's Pass and the other 5 goes onto stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh and increase my threat to 40.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN EIGHT\n\n\n \n\n\nAs usual I add resources then draw Defender of Rammas before I spend 1 resource from Legolas and Beregond and 2 resources from Eowyn to play Boromir.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Guthlaf for a total of 7 willpower. The staging draw is Under the Shadow for a total threat of 1. Of the 6 progress made, 5 explores Stage 2B and I increase my threat to 44 to take the other 2 objectives and attach them to Legolas and Beregond before moving on to stage 3B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh and discard the three objectives before increasing my threat to 45. This is troubling as it means that I am going to have to race through stage 3B.\n\n\n \n\n\nTURN NINE\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the start of the turn I add resources and draw Defender of Rammas before proceeding tot he quest phase where I commit Legolas, Eowyn, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Guthlaf and Boromir for a total of 9 willpower. In order to win the quest I need to draw a card with less than 4 threat. I draw Caught in a Web, which attaches to Eowyn just as I manage to win the quest (presumably by Beregond and his allies dragging Eowyn and Legolas out of Dol Goldur, webbing and all).\n\n\n \n\n\nI suspect I hit very lucky with this game. The hero combo is showing it's quality more and more as the quests get steadily more complicated and I've never had a deck complete EfDG on the first time. The score was:\n\n\n \n\n\nTurns (9): 90\n\n\nThreat: 45.\n\n\nDamage: 1\n\n\nVP: 5\n\n\nTotal: 131\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1348455","commentId":1348455,"userName":"haslo","timestamp":1417079536,"content":"I just beat my head against Dul Goldur for a while yesterday evening - wanted to win with my Outlands deck, but to no avail  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] glad to see it's actually beatable!  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1348500","commentId":1348500,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1417085190,"content":"Like I said, I hit lucky with the encounter deck.

This gives me a total threat of 29.\n\n \n\nMy starting hand is Arwen Undomiel, Daughter of the Nimrodel x2, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Gandalf (Core) and Henamarth Riversong. Since it's got Henamarth Riversong in it I'll keep it.\n\n \n\nThe quest's set-up is relatively easy, I draw the top card from the encounter deck, Banks of the Anduin.\n\n \n\nTURN ONE\n\n \n\nAt the start of the turn I add a resource to all my heroes and draw A Test Of Will and Gandalf (Core) before I spend 1 resource from Bilbo to pay for Henamarth Riversong. I then exhaust Henamarth to look at the top card of the encounter deck. It is a Signs of Gollum.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Bilbo, Haldir and Idraen for a total of 5 willpower. Against that I draw, oddly enough, Signs of Gollum which is guarded by River Ninglor for a total of 3 threat. The 2 progress I make is added to stage 1B.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to River Ninglor then skip the encounter and combat phases. At the end of the turn I refresh my cards and increase my threat to 30 before River Ninglor removes a progress from stage 1B.\n\n \n\nTURN TWO\n\n \n\nTo start off I add resources and draw Self-Preservation and Warden of Healing. I then spend 1 resource each from Bilbo and Haldir to pay for Warden of Healing and 2 resources from Idraen to pay for Arwen Undomiel. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top of the encounter deck, Evil Storm.\n\n \n\nKnowing what the next card is I commit Bilbo, Haldir, Idraen, the Warden of Healing and Arwen for a total of 8 willpower. The staging draw is Evil Storm, which has no effect and I make 8 progress, 4 of which explore River Ninglor (readying Idraen and adding the Signs of Gollum to Bilbo) and the other 4 go on stage 1B. Now that I read the full stage 1B I remember to look at the top 3 cards in the encounter deck and place Evil Storm into the staging area which, again, does nothing at all.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to the Banks of the Anduin.\n\n \n\nSkipping the encounter and combat phases I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 31.\n\n \n\nTURN THREE\n\n \n\nAs usual I add a resource to all my heroes and draw Cloak of Lorien and Song of Wisdom. I then spend 1 resource from Haldir to play Cloak of Lorien on him and spend 1 resource from Bilbo to play Song of Wisdom on Idraen. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck, River Ninglor.\n\n \n\nMoving on to the quest phase, I once again commit Bilbo, Haldir, Idraen, the Warden of Healing and Arwen for a total of 8 willpower. The draw, unsurprisingly is River Ninglor for a total of 2 threat, meaning another 6 progress is made, 3 of which explores Banks of the Anduin and sends it to the top of the encounter deck as well as readying Idraen. The last 3 progress completes stage 1B and I proceed to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to River Ninglor before skipping the encounter and combat phases before refreshing all my cards and increasing my threat to 32.\n\n \n\nTURN FOUR\n\n \n\nAs usual the turn starts with me adding a resource to all my heroes and drawing Miner of the Iron Hills and Wingfoot. I then spend 1 resource from Haldir to play Wingfoot on Haldir as well as spending 2 resources from Idraen to play Galadriel's Handmaiden (reducing my threat to 31) before spending 2 resources from Bilbo and 1 resource from Haldir to pay for Daughter of the Nimrodel.\n\n \n\nProceeding to the quest phase I have to look at the top 2 cards of the encounter deck and put 1 into the staging area, I select the Banks of the Anduin. I then commit Haldir, Idraen, Warden of Healing, Arwen, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Daughter of the Nimrodel for a total of 11 willpower before choosing “Location”. The staging draw is Treacherous Fog, which adds 1 to the threat of Banks of the Anduin for a total of 2 threat. A whopping 9 progress is made, 4 explores River Ninglor and readies Idraen before the other 5 go onto stage 2B.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to Banks of the Anduin before skipping the encounter and combat phases. I then refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 32.\n\n \n\nTURN FIVE\n\n \n\nAt the start of the turn I add resources and draw two Ethir Swordsmen. Handy although I can't pay for them this turn.\n\n \n\nSkipping the planning stage I proceed to the quest phase where, after putting Evil Storm into play and having a lower threat than the minimum threat to trigger it, discard the card. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck. It is pursued by Shadow so I will have to commit everyone to the quest to lower the threat increase. In order to do so I commit Bilbo, Haldir (naming Treachery for Wingfoot), Idraen, Warden of Healing, Arwen, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Daughter of Nimrodel for a total of 11 willpower. The staging draw is Pursued By Shadows. Haldir refreshes thanks to Wingfoot and Henamarth Riversong and I am forced to raise my threat to 33. The threat total is 0 so 11 progress is made. The first 3 progress explores Banks of the Anduin and return it to the top of the encounter deck before the next 8 progress explores Stage 2B and I move on to stage 3.\n\n \n\nThankfully I have a clue card attached to Bilbo so gameplay proceeds with me again skipping the encounter and combat phases and refreshing my cards before I increase my threat to 34. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck, it is Banks of the Anduin which means that I can, in theory win this in the next turn.\n\n \n\nTURN SIX\n\n \n\nTo start the turn I add a resource to all my heroes before drawing Daeron's Runes and Galadhrim Minstrel. I then play Daeron's Runes, draw Erebor Hammersmith and Unexpected Courage and discard one of my Gandalf's. I then spend 2 resources each from Bilbo and Haldir and 1 resource from Idraen to play Core set Gandalf into play. I then use his ability to lower my threat to 29.\n\n \n\nProceeding to the quest phase I commit Bilbo, Haldir (guessing Location for Wingfoot), Idraen, Warden of Healing, Arwen, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Daughter of the Nimrodel and Gandalf for a grand total of 16 willpower. In response, the staging draw is Banks of the Anduin for a total of 1 threat. In a case of ridiculous amounts of overkill I make 15 progress, 7 more than is needed to complete stage 3B and win the quest.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion this deck worked remarkably well. I hit lucky by not having a fight in the whole game (I'm guessing there may have been something deeply wrong with the shuffle but I was filtering out any enemies in the first two stages using the quest effects and it seemed to work. One thing I noticed is that I can potentially have all my characters readying at one point or another in the round. The Henamarth Riversong – Wingfoot combo is nasty.\n\n \n\nIn the end, the total score was:\n\nTurns (6): 60\n\nThreat: 29\n\nDamage: 0\n\nVP: 0\n\nTotal: 89\n\nEdited November 28, 2014 by silverthorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1351300","commentId":1351300,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1417307135,"content":"GAME 159 – CONFLICT AT THE CARROCK\n\n \n\nFor this game I am going to try a deck I've never played before, a all-Gondor deck. The heroes will be Boromir (Leadership), Eleanor and Mablung for a total of 28 threat. My starting hand is A Test Of Will, Blood of Numenor, Envoy of Pelargir, Pelargir Ship Captain, Spear of the Citadel and Visionary Leadership.\n\n \n\nSince I didn't get certain cards I mulligan, drawing Blood of Numenor, Envoy of Pelargir, Feint, Gandalf (Core), Gondorian Fire and Squire of the Citadel.\n\n \n\nThe set-up for the quest adds the Carrock to the staging area and I am ready to begin.\n\n \n\nTURN ONE\n\n \n\nAs usual I start with adding a resource to all my heroes before I draw Steward of Gondor, I really couldn't ask for a better first turn draw.\n\n \n\nIn the planning stage I spend 1 resource each from Eleanor and Mablung to play Envoy of Pelargir, who adds a resource to Boromir. I then spend 2 resources from Boromir to play Steward of Gondor before exhausting it to add 2 resources to Boromir and remove 1 resource from Boromir to play Squire of the Citadel. I then play Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire on Boromir.\n\n \n\nProceeding to the quest phase I commit Mablung (for 2), Envoy of Pelargir (for 2) and Squire of the Citadel (for 1) for a total of 5 willpower.\n\n \n\nAgainst that I draw Bee Pastures, which makes a total of 3 threat. 2 progress goes onto Stage 1B.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to Bee Pastures, which allows me to search the encounter deck for Grimbeorn the Old.and place him into the staging area.\n\n \n\nSkipping the encounter and combat phases I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 29.\n\n \n\nTURN TWO\n\n \n\nI add a resource to all my heroes and draw Herald from Amorien.

In response Boromir attacks the Goblin Sniper and kills him.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refresh my cards before increasing my threat to 31 and transferring a resource from Boromir to Grimbeorn the Old.\n\n \n\nTURN FOUR\n\n \n\nAt the start of the turn I add a resource to all my heroes and draw another Feint. I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir before transferring another resource from Boromir to Grimbeorn the Old.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I remove 2 resources from Eleanor and 3 from Mablung to pay for Gandalf (Core). I then use his ability to drop my threat to 26.\n\n\nDuring the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1) and Herald of Amorien (for 2) for a total 5 willpower.\n\n \n\nAgainst this I draw Muck Adder for a total of 3 threat. 2 progress is made against stage 1B before Boromir then transfers a resource to Grimbeorn the Old.\n\n \n\nSkipping the travel phase the Muck Adder engages me (as usual adding a resource to Mablung).\n\n \n\nIn the combat phase the Muck Adder attack Gandalf doing no damage and the Misty Mountain Goblins attack Mablung, removing 1 progress from Stage 1B and doing no damage. In response Boromir and Eleanor attack for 4, killing the Muck Adder. Boromir then transfers a resource to Grimbeorn the Old.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh all my cards and increase my threat to 27 before Boromir transfers a resource to Grimbeorn the Old and he becomes a ally. Gandalf then is discarded.\n\n \n\nTURN FIVE\n\n \n\nTo begin the turn I add a resource to all my heroes before drawing Defender of Rammas. I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir before spending 2 resources from Mablung to play Defender of Rammas.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1), Herald of Amorien (for 2) and Errand-Rider (for 1) for a total of 6 willpower. The staging draw is Banks of the Anduin for a total of 3 threat. 3 progress goes onto stage 1B before I travel to Banks of the Anduin.\n\n \n\nSkipping the encounter phase the Misty Mountain Goblins attack Defender of Rammas (removing a progress from Stage 1B). I get lucky as the shadow card is a Hill Troll and has no effect. The Goblins do no damage and Boromir finally kills them.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh everything and increase my threat to 28.\n\n \n\nTURN SIX\n\n \n\nTo start the turn I add a resource to all my heroes and draw another Herald of Amorien.

The replacement is another Muck-Adder. The total threat is 3, meaning that 5 progress is made. The first 3 progress explores Banks of the Anduin and sends it to the top of the encounter deck. The other 2 finally completes stage 1B.\n\n \n\nAt this point the Carrock becomes the active location and I proceed to stage 2B. Louis, Morris, Rupert and Stuart come into play, thankfully with 34 threat I have a round or two to whittle down their numbers.\n\n \n\nSpeaking of which, after skipping the travel phase I am forced to engage the Muck-Adder (which adds another resource to Mablung) and optionally engage Stuart.\n\n \n\nIn the combat phase the Muck-Adder attacks the Defender of Rammas and does no damage. Stuart then attacks Grimbeorn the Old and does 1 damage to him. In return, Boromir pays 1 resource to activate Gondorian Fire and add 4 to his attack. Boromir, Mablung and Grimbeorn then attack for 13, killing Stuart.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh my cards and increase my threat to 29.\n\n \n\nTURN SEVEN\n\n \n\nAt the start of the turn I add a resource to all my heroes before drawing A Test Of Will. I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1), Herald of Amorien (for 2), another Herald of Amorien (for 2) and Errand-Rider (for 1) for a total of 8 willpower. Against that I draw Oak Wood Grove, which means that the threat total is also 8. No progress is made.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping the travel phase I optionally engage Morris (and add a resource to Mablung). Morris's attack on Grimbeorn is Feinted at the cost of 1 resource from Mablung and the Muck-Adder's attack on Defender of Rammas does no damage. In response, Borormir removes a resource to trigger Gondorian Fire before Boromir and Grimbeorn the Old attack for 13, killing Morris.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refresh my cards and increase my threat to 30.\n\n \n\nTURN EIGHT\n\n \n\nAt the start of the turn I add a resource to all my heroes before drawing Gandalf (Core). I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir. Before spending 3 resources from Mablung and 2 for Eleanor to play Gandalf, who then does 4 damage to the Muck-Adder, killing it.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1), Herald of Amorien (for 2), another Herald of Amorien (for 2), Gandalf (for 4) and Errand-Rider (for 1) for a total of 12 willpower.\n\n \n\nCountering that, I draw Bee Pastures for a total of 7 threat. 5 progress is made and goes onto The Carrock.\n\n \n\nOnce again skipping the travel phase I optionally engage Rupert whose attack on Grimbeorn is Feinted at the cost of 1 resource from Mablung. Boromir Borormir removes a resource to trigger Gondorian Fire before Boromir and Grimbeorn the Old attack for 15, more than killing Rupert.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refresh all my cards before raising my threat to 31 and discarding Gandalf.\n\n \n\nTURN NINE\n\n \n\nAt the start of the turn I add a attachment to all my heroes before drawing another Herald of Amorien. I then exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir. I then spend 2 resources from Boromir to play the last Herald of Amorien.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Envoy of Pelargir (for 2), Squire of the Citadel (for 1), Herald of Amorien (for 2), another Herald of Amorien (for 2) and another Herald of Amorien (for 2) for a total of 9 wilpower.\n\n \n\nIn response I draw Sacked! Which I negate by exhausting Eleanor. The replacement is Despair which has no effect. The total threat is 5, meaning that 4 progress is made. The first explores the Carrock and the next one completes stage 2B. All I have to do is kill Louis to complete the quest.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping travel I optionally engage Louis who attacks Grimbeorn the Old for 4, doing no damage. In response Boromir spends a resource to trigger Gondorian Fire, which gives him a unholy 11 attack and, alongside Grimbeorn the Old does 15 damage to Louis, thoroughly killing him and winning the quest.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, this deck is ridiculous once I get Steward of Gondor under Boromir his stats can be boosted to a ridiculous amount by Gondorian Fire and Blood of Numenor. Also my questing was boosted greatly by Boromir's ability (the main reason why I didn't go Eleanor/Imrahil/Tactics Boromir). Mablung was generating a lot of resources but I drew relatively few Tactics cards to play them on and Eleanor's suffered from the same problem but her ability was handy on the few occasions I needed to use it (although there are some scenarios where it will be so useful). All in all, I'm starting to wonder why I never built a Gondor deck before."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1351807","commentId":1351807,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1417367627,"content":"GAMES 160-162 - A JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL\n\n \n\nThese three tries confirmed why I've tended to avoid all-Gondor decks over the years.

I then spent 1 resouce to play Song of Wisdom on Idraen before spending 1 resource each from Idraen and Haldir to play Galadhrim Minstrel. She lets me look at the top 5 cards in my deck for a event. The only one I draw is Lore of Imladris, a mighty handy event in the quest.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Glorfindel (for 3), Haldir (for 2, refreshing with Unexpected Courage), Idraen (for 2), Wilyador (for 1) and Galadhrim Minstrel (for 1) for a total of 9 willpower.\n\n \n\nI then drew Forest Glade for a total of 3 threat. 6 progress goes onto Rhosgobel, exploring it and readying Idraen as well as putting Rhosgobel into my victory pile. The last 2 progress goes onto stage 2B.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to Forest Glade.\n\n \n\nSince I didn't optionally engage the Mirkwood Flock I proceed to end the turn by refreshing everything, adding threat and taking wounds on Wilyador.\n\n \n\nTURN FOUR: THREAT: 28, WILYADOR WOUNDS: 8\n\n \n\nTo start this round I added resources to my heroes before drawing Elrond's Counsel.

I then played Elrond's Counsel on Idraen to add a willpower and drop my threat to 25. I finished with a total 10 willpower.\n\n \n\nI then drew Great Forest Web for a total of 3 threat. 7 progress was made, 2 explored Forest Glade, refreshing Idraen and searching the encounter deck for a Athelas which was guarded by another Forest Glade. I then exhausted Asfaloth to explore Forest Glade and exhausted Idraen to attach Athelas to her. 5 progress was placed on stage 2B,\n\n \n\nAfter exhausting Haldir I travel to Great Forest Web and exhaust Glorfindel to attach a Athelad to him before skipping the encounter and combat phases.\n\n \n\nI then end the turn by raising my threat and adding wounds to Wilyador.\n\n \n\nTURN FIVE  THREAT: 26, WILYADOR WOUNDS: 5.\n\n \n\nTo start the turn I added resources to my heroes before drawing A Test Of Will.

I therefore win the quest.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, this deck seemed to gel well from the get go.

Although I can't use it right now it's going to be able to cut the amount of turns I'll need to finish this quest. I then exhaust Henamarth Riversong to look at the top encounter card, namely The Necromancer's Reach. This is going to take some planning.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3 (adding to my threat) and played Elrond's Counsel to add 1 to Glorfindel's willpower while cutting my threat. The willpower total was 4.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe encounter draw was The Necromancer's Reach, which did another point of damage on Glorfindel.

I then spent 1 resource from Haldir to play Wingfoot on him and 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Idraen to play Arwen Undomiel.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, adding 1 to my threat, Haldir for 2 (calling enemy) and Arwen Undomiel for 2 (adding her defense bonus to Idraen) for a total of 7 willpower.\n\n \n\nI then drew The East Bight for a total of 2 threat. 5 progress was made towards stage 1B,\n\n \n\nDuring the travel phase I travelled to the East Bight before I skipped the encounter and combat phases and refreshed my cards before increasing my threat and ending my turn.\n\n \n\n[TURN TWO – 30 THREAT, 5/12 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 1B]\n\n \n\nTo begin this turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Light Of Valinor. I then proceeded to spend 1 resource from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on him.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, Haldir for 2 (calling enemy), Idraen for 2  and Arwen Undomiel for 2 (adding her defense bonus to Idraen) for a total of 9 willpower.\n\n \n\nThe draw was Goblin Sniper (readying Haldir) for a total of 3 threat. 6 progress is made, just enough to explore the East Bight (and ready Idraen).\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to Wood Elf Path before optioally engaging the Goblin Sniper.\n\n \n\nThe Goblin Sniper attacks Idraen, doing no damage before Haldir and Glorfindel attack and kill it.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat.\n\n \n\n[TURN THREE – 34 THREAT, 5/12 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 1B]\n\n \n\nAt the start of the turn I added a resource to my heroes and drew Galadhrim Minstrel. I then spent 2 resources from Haldir to pay for Galadhrim Minstrel who search my deck for a event, Elrond's Counsel and 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Idraen to pay for Imladris Stargazer, who I immediately exhausted to look at and rearrange the top 5 cards of my deck.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, Haldir for 2 (calling Enemy), Idraen for 2, Arwen Undomiel for 2 (giving Idraen +1 defence) and Galadhrim Minstrel for 1. I then played Elrond's Counsel to drop my threat and add another willpower for a total of 11 willpower.\n\n \n\nThe draw was Warg Rider (which readied Haldir) who surged to Dry Watercourse for 3 threat. 8  progress was made, 3 explored Wood Elf Trail (readying Idraen) and 5 was added to stage 1B.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travelled to Dry Watercourse before the Wolf Rider engaged me.\n\n \n\nIn the combat phase the Wolf Rider attacked Idraen, doing no damage before Glorfindel killed it.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat.\n\n \n\n[TURN FOUR – 35 THREAT, 10/12 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 1B]\n\n \n\nAt the start of the turn I added resources to my heroes before drawing Asfaloth.

The threat total is 0 so 14 progress massively over-kills the 3 threat needed to complete stage 2A. I then exhausted Imladris Stargazer to look at and rearrange the top 5 cards of my deck.\n\n \n\nSkipping the rest of the turn I refresh my cards before raising my threat and discarding Gandalf.\n\n \n\n[TURN SIX – 38 THREAT, 0/7 PROGRESS TOWARDS TOWARDS STAGE 3B]\n\n \n\nAfter adding resource I drew Unexpected Courage.\n\n \n\nIn the questing phase I committed Glorfindel for 3, Haldir for 2 (calling Enemy), Idraen for 2, Arwen Undomiel for 2 (giving Idraen +1 defence) and Galadhrim Minstrel for 1 for a total of 10 willpower.\n\n \n\nThe draw was Gollum's Bite and I alocate 4 damage to Glorfindel.

I then spent 1 resource from Haldir to play Henamarth Riversong before exhausting her to look at the top card of the encounter deck. It was a Great Forest Web which was good news.\n\n \n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed pretty much everyone and managed 10 willpower before drawing Great Forest Web for 2 threat. I made 8 progress and, since there were no enemies in play, completed the quest and the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1354159","commentId":1354159,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1417543841,"content":"GAME 167 – INTO THE PIT\n\n\n \n\n\nIn honor of starting the Khazad-Dum expansion I brought in a deck full of Dwarves.

This reduces my threat to twenty two and draws another Self-Preservation.\n\n\nI exhaust Narvi's Belt to add a lore icon to Dain Ironfoot.\n\n\nI spend three resources from Dain Ironfoot to play another Self-Preservation on Bifur.\n\n\n \n\n\nQuest Phase\n\n\nI commit Bifur for three, Nori for three and the three Zigil Miners for six.\n\n\nIn addition to the three threat in play I draw Many Roads which shuffles all locations back into the encounter deck before it surges to Dreadful Gap, which replaces Lightless Passage. The bad thing is that I need to make ten progress to pass it.\n\n\nAfter adding Lightless Passage there is a total of seven threat in play to my twelve willpower. Five progress goes onto Dreadful Gap.\n\n\n \n\n\nEncounter Phase\n\n\nI optionally engage the Patrol Leader.\n\n\n \n\n\nCombat Phase\n\n\nThe Patrol Leader attacks the Miner of the Iron Hills.\n\n\nThe shadow card is Signs of Conflict which increases my threat to twenty four.\n\n\nThe Patrol Leader does four damage to the Miner of the Iron Hills, kiliing it.\n\n\nThe Longbeard Orc Slayer, Erebor Hammersmith and Dwalin attack for 7, the draw is Zigil Mineshaft, which means that the Patrol Leader is killed. This completes stage 2.\n\n\n \n\n\nRefresh Stage\n\n\nI refresh my cards.\n\n\nI increase my threat to twenty five.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Eight\n\n\n \n\n\nResource Phase\n\n\nI draw King Under The Mountain.\n\n\n \n\n\nQuest Phase\n\n\nI commit Bifur for three, Nori for three, three Zigil Miners for six, Erebor Hammersmith for two, Dwalin for two and Longbeard Orc Slayer for one.\n\n\nIn addition to the four threat in play I draw Stairs of Nain for two.\n\n\nI make seventeen willpower against six threat meaning that eleven progress is made. Four explores Dreadful Gap and sends it to the victory display before seven progress goes onto stage 3B.\n\n\n \n\n\nTravel phase\n\n\nI travel to Lightless Passage, refreshing Bifur and Nori and reducing my threat to twenty three.\n\n\nI exhaust the Cave Torch to add three progress to Lightless Passage and draw Signs of Conflict which is discarded.\n\n\n \n\n\nRefresh Phase\n\n\nI refresh my cards.\n\n\nI increase my threat to twenty four.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Nine\n\n\n \n\n\nResource Phase\n\n\nI draw Gloin.\n\n\n \n\n\nQuest Phase\n\n\nI commit Bifur for three, Nori for three, three Zigil Miners for six, Erebor Hammersmith for two, Dwalin for two and Longbeard Orc Slayer for one.\n\n\nIn addition to the two threat in the staging area I draw another Stairs of Nain for two threat.\n\n\nI exhaust Cave Torch to add the final progress to Lightless Passage before drawing Zigil Mineshaft, which is discarded.\n\n\nMy willpower is seventeen against four threat so thirteen progress is made. It is more than enough to explore stage 3B and win the quest.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThis deck is ridiculous. I spent nine turns and ended up with a lower threat than I started off with.

The up side is that they are tough heroes. The down side is that I wind up with a threat of 32.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter a mulligan I drew Bofur, Citadel Plate x2, Feint, Song of Battle and Steward of Gondor.\n\n\n \n\n\nFor quest set-up I add Book of Mazarbul to Aragorn before drawing Goblin Spearman.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn One\n\n\n \n\n\nI added a resource to each hero before drawing Galadhon Archer.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the planning phase I spent one resource from Gimli and Legolas to play Galadhon Archer who does one damage to Gondor Spearman.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Aragorn for two and Gimli for two for a total of four willpower before I drew Goblin Spearman for a total of three threat. I make one progress on stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the encounter phase I was forced to engage both Goblin Spearman and Gobln Swordsman.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the combat phase the Goblin Spearman attacks Aragorn for two, doing no damage. The Goblin Swordsman then attacked the Galadhon Archer for 3, killing her. Legolas then attacked the Goblin Swordsman for three, killing it and adding two progress to stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Two\n\n\n \n\n\nI added a resource to all my heroes then drew Nalth Guide.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the planning phase I used two resources from Aragorn to buy Steward of Gondor. I then exhausted the Steward of Gondor to add two resources to Aragorn and used the two resources to purchase Nalth Guide, who makes it that Gimli doesn't need to exhaust to quest this turn.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Aragorn for two, Gimli for two and Nalth Guide for one for five total willpower. I then drew Upper Hall for three which increases my threat to thirty five. Two progress goes onto stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the travel phase I travelled to Upper Hall.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the combat phase the Goblin Spearman attacked Gimli for no damage.

Three progress was made, two explored Upper Hall and one progress was added to stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the encounter phase I engaged the Goblin Spearman.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the combat phase the Goblin Spearman attacked Aragorn, doing no damage. In return, Legolas attacked the Goblin Spearman, killing him and adding another two progress to stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to thirty seven.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Four\n\n\n \n\n\nI added a resource to my heroes before drawing Boromir. I then exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two resources to Aragorn.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the planning phase I used one resource each from Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas to play Bofur who I then exhausted to look for a Weapon in the top five cards of my deck. I hit lucky and put Dwarrowdelf Axe into my hand before spending a resource from Aragorn to play Dwarrowdelf Axe on Gimli. I ended the phase by spending the last two resources on Aragorn to play Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Aragorn for two, Gimli for two and Nalth Guide for one for a total five willpower. I then drew Goblin Scout for a total of three threat. Another two progress went onto stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the encounter phase the Goblin Scout engaged me before attacking Aragorn. The attack did no damage but the shadow card added a Goblin Swordsman to the staging area. Legolas then killed the Goblin Swordsman to add three progress to stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to thirty eight.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Five\n\n\n \n\n\nTo begin the turn I added a resource to each hero, exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two more resources to Aragorn and drew Errand-Rider.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the planning phase I used four resources from Aragorn to play Boromir before spending the last resource from Aragorn to play Errand-Rider.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Aragorn for four, Nalth Guide for one and Bofur for two for a total seven willpower. I then drew Plundered Armory for a total of four threat. The three progress I made completes stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nStage 2 removes the Book of Mazarbul from play.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the travel phase I travel to the Plundered Armoury.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the encounter phase the Goblin Swordsman engages me before attacking Aragorn and doing two damage to him. In revenge, Legolas kills the Goblin Swordsman and adds two progress to the Plundered Armoury, exploring it and adding Citadel Plate to Aragorn before adding one progress to stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to thirty nine.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Six\n\n\n \n\n\nAs the turn started I added a resource to each hero, exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two more resources to Aragorn and drew Nalth Guide.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the planning phase I used two resources from Aragorn to play Nalth Guide, nominating Aragorn to not have to commit to quest this turn.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Aragorn for four, two Nalth Guides for two and Bofur for two for a total eight willpower. I then drew Goblin Swordsman for two before the regular staging draw was Goblin Spearman for a total four threat. Four progress went onto stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the encounter phase I engaged Goblin Spearman and Goblin Swordsman. The Goblin Spearman then attacked Aragorn, doing one damage while the Goblin Swordsman attacked Boromir, doing one damage and readying him. In return, Legolas attacked the Goblin Swordsman, killing him and adding three progress to stage 2B. Gimli and Boromir then attacked the Goblin Spearman and killed it.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the round I refreshed before increasing my threat to forty.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Seven\n\n\n \n\n\nTo start with I added a resource to each hero, exhausted Steward of Gondor to add two more resources to Aragorn and drew another Errand-Rider.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the planning phase I used one resource from Aragorn to play another Errand-Rider.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Aragorn for four, Gimli for two, Legolas for one, two Nalth Guides for two, Bofur for two and Boromir for one for total twelve willpower.\n\n\n \n\n\nI then draw for stage 2B for no effect before staging drawing Goblin Spearman for two total threat. Ten progress is made, completing the stage and winning the quest.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThis deck was different to most decks I've played before. The heroes were tougher than most but the high threat adds a sense of urgency that most decks don't. All in all, it was fun and I'll definitely be using this deck for the next quest.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1355342","commentId":1355342,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1417628019,"content":"Deleted duplicate post.\n\nEdited December 3, 2014 by silverthorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1355624","commentId":1355624,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1417640514,"content":"Posting the same reply twice helps lengthing the thread at least. ;p"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1355765","commentId":1355765,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1417648371,"content":"I have no idea how that happened, it's probably fate that when I did it was just after I had made a comment about how well the whole thing was going."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1356749","commentId":1356749,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1417720179,"content":"GAME 169 – ESCAPE FROM MORIA\n\n \n\nDue to having to build a deck for a run-through of the Fellowship saga scenarios and having been told that all the nine members of the Fellowship have been blagged by the other players I had to go back to the drawing board.\n\n \n\nArmed with a list of characters who were already taken I decided to go with a eclectic set of heroes. Bilbo Baggins for extra card draw, Denethor for encounter deck manipulation and Eowyn for questing. This gives me a useable starting threat of twenty six.\n\n \n\nAfter a mulligan my starting hand was Erebor Hammersmith, Miner of the Iron Hills, Short Cut, Song of Travel, The Galadhrim's Greeting and Unexpected Courage.\n\n \n\nQuest set-up was to add the Nameless Fear to the staging area and draw and add the Mountains Roots to the staging area before putting stage 1B into the victory display and selecting a random stage 2A.\n\n \n\nTurn one begins with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Elrond and Hasty Stroke.\n\n \n\nProceeding to the planning stage I used one resource from Bilbo to play Song of Travel on Denethor before using one resource each from Denethor and Eowyn to play Unexpected Courage on Denethor. I ended the phase by exhausting Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, another The Mountains' Roots, and place it back at the top of the deck before exhausting Unexpected Courage to refresh him.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Eowyn and Bilbo for a total of five willpower. I then flipped stage 2A to A Wrong Turn, which adds The Mountains' Roots to the staging area. In addition to the Nameless Fear (two) and the two The Mountains' Roots (one each) I drew Abandoned Tools, which was guarded by Fouled Well (three) for a total of seven threat. I discarded Elrond from my hand to avoid it surging. My threat was increased to twenty eight.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travelled to the Fouled Well.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the combat phase I bypassed A Wrong Turn before exhausting Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck.it is a Chieftain of the Pit, who I put at the bottom of the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nAt the end of turn one I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to twenty nine.\n\n \n\nTurn Two\n\n \n\nAt the start of turn two I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Arwen Undomiel and Henamarth Riversong. This is a fine pair of cards to draw.\n\n \n\nDuring planning I used one resource from Bilbo to play Henamarth Riversong, then used one resource each from Denethor and Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel. I then exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the deck, using Unexpected Courage to ready him. The card was another The Mountains' Roots which I returned to the top of the deck.\n\n \n\nDuring questing I committed Eowyn for four, Bilbo for one, Arwen for two (adding her defence buff to Denethor) and Henamarth Riversong for one for a total of eight willpower.\n\n \n\nI then flipped stage 2 to Escape From Darkness before drawing another The Mountains' Roots (I did shuffle the deck twice) for a total of five threat. Three progress is put onto Fouled Well before i exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Goblin Archer. I move it to the bottom of the deck.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to thirty.\n\n \n\nTurn Three\n\n \n\nAt the start of the turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Gleowine and the Galadhrim's Greeting.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I used one resource each from Bilbo and Denethor to pay for Gleowine, who I immediately to draw another Arwen Undomiel. I then exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, exhausting Unexpected Courage to ready him. The card, Great Cave Troll, was sent to the bottom of the deck.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Bilbo for one, Eowyn for four, Arwen for two (adding her defence buff to Denethor) and Henamarth Riversong for one. This gave me a total willpower of eight.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw was Massing In The Deep, which raises my threat to thirty one as well as adding another card, Sudden Pitfall, which discards Henamarth Riversong.\n\n \n\nThat leaves me with a reduced willpower of seven against five in the staging area. Two progress is placed onto Fouled Well, which explores it and allows me to exhaust Bilbo to attach Abandoned Tools to him. I then exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Undisturbed Bones, and place it at the bottom of the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travelled to one of the The Mountains Roots.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to thirty two.\n\n \n\nTurn Four\n\n \n\nTo start the turn I added a resource to all my heroes before drawing Daeron's Runes and Galadriel's Handmaiden. I immediately played Daeron's Runes to draw Elrond and Core Set Gandalf. I then discarded Elrond before exhausting Gleowine to draw another Daeron's Runes (I checked, and the card under Elrond in the discard pile was the last Daeron's Runes). I then played the Daeron's Runes to draw Lore of Imladris and Song of Travel. Still no Fast Hitch and I decided to discard the Song of Travel.\n\n \n\nFinally moving onto the planning stage I used the two resources on Eowyn to play Galadriel's Handmaiden who lowers my threat to thirty one. I then spent one resource each from Bilbo and Denethor to play Erebor Hammersmith, which returns the Song of Travel to my hand.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn for four, Denethor for one, Arwen for two (buffing Denethor), Galadriel's Handmaiden for two and Erebor Hammersmith for one for a total of ten willpower. before drawing Undisturbed Bones, which makes me do four damage to a ally. Gleowine takes the hit for the team. The total threat is four, meaning that six progress is put on The Mountains Roots, exploring it.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travel to another The Mountains Roots. I then exhausted Unexpected Courage to refresh Denethor before exhausting him to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Goblin Spearman, and put him at the bottom of the deck.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed all my cards before increasing my threat to thirty two and exhausting Bilbo to add one progress to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nTurn Five\n\n \n\nTo start off I added a resource to all my heroes before drawing A Test Of Will and Fast Hitch.i then exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the deck, Great Cave Troll, and put it at the bottom of the deck. I then used Unexpected Courage to refresh him.\n\n \n\nIn the planning stage I used one resource from Bilbo to give him Fast Hitch. I ended the phase by exhausting Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Shadow of Fear, and move it to the bottom of the deck.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Eowyn for four, Arwen for two (buffing Bilbo) and Galadriel's Handmaiden for two for a total of eightm willpower.\n\n \n\nThe staging draw was another Fouled Well, which forces me to exhaust Bilbo and makes for a total of six threat. Four progress is made which explores the Mountains Roots. I then used Fast Hitch to refresh Bilbo,\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travelled to Fouled Well.\n\n \n\nin the refresh phase I refresh all my cards before exhausting Bilbo to add a progress to stage 2B before readying him by exhausting Fast Hitch to exhaust him to do another progress onto stage 2B. I then increased my threat to thirty three.\n\n \n\nTurn Six\n\n \n\nWith one progress left to make to finish the game all I need to do is finish the turn with Bilbo alive. With this in mind I added a resource to all my heroes before drawing Galadriel's Handmaiden and Imladris Stargazer. I then exhausted Denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Goblin Spearman, which I put on the bottom of the deck. I then exhausted Unexpected Courage to refresh Denethor before exhausting him again to look at the top encounter card again. The card is Plundered Armoury which I put back at the top of the deck.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I commit Eowyn for four, Arwen for two, Galadriel's Handmaiden for two and Erebor Hammersmith for one for a total of nine willpower.\n\n \n\nNot unsurprisingly, the top card is Armoury for three making a total of six threat. Three progress went onto Fouled Well.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed and increased my threat to thirty four before using two resources from Eowyn and one from Denethor to play The Galadhrim's Greeting and drop my threat back to twenty eight. I then exhausted Bilbo to add a final progress to Escape From Darkness and win the game.\n\n \n\nThis was interesting. The addition of Bilbo instead of Gimli makes the deck more of a sneaky deck where avoiding fights is more important than winning them. \n\nEdited December 5, 2014 by silverthorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1357521","commentId":1357521,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1417782037,"content":"GAME 170 – THE REDHORN GATE\n\n\n \n\n\nMy new line-up is the 'E Team' consisting of Eladan, Elrohir and Eowyn.

This gave me a starting threat of 24.\n\n \n\nMy starting hand was Defender of Rammas x2, Elrond's Counsel, Gondorian Shield, Light of Valinor and Unexpected Courage. This gave me pretty much all the high-priority cards I wanted.\n\n \n\nQuest set-up consisted of placing Forest Spider and Old Forest Road.\n\n \n\nTurn one began with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Northern Tracker.\n\n \n\nDuring planning I played Gondorian Shield on Beregond before I paid 1 resource from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on Glorfindel.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Glorfindel before playing Elrond's Counsel to add a willpower and reduce my threat to 21. I then committed Eowyn for a total of 8 willpower.\n\n \n\nIn addition to the 3 threat currently in the staging area I drew another Forest Spider for a total of 5 threat. 3 progress was placed on stage 1B. \n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travelled to Old Forest Road, using it's ability to ready Eowyn.\n\n \n\nIn the encounter phase I optionally engaged one of the Forest Spiders, who immediately attacked Beregond. The shadow card was Enchanted Stream which did nothing. The attack did no damage and Eomer and Glorfindel attacked for 4, doing 3 damage.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed everything before increasing my threat to 22.\n\n \n\nTurn two commenced with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Song of Travel.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 2 resources from Beregond to play Defender from Rammas. I then paid 2 resources from Eomer to play Unexpected Courage on Beregond.\n\n \n\nDuring the quest phase I committed Eomer and Glorfindel for 7 willpower. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Great Forest Web for 4 total threat. I made 3 progress, exploring Old Forest Road.\n\n \n\nIn the travel phase I travelled to Great Forest Web, exhausting Beregond, then refreshing him with Unexpected Courage.\n\n \n\nAfter declining to engage the Forest Spider in the staging area, the other Forest Spider attacked Beregond again. The shadow card was Old Forest Road, for no effect and the Spider did no damage. In return Glorfindel and Eowyn attacked for 4 killing it.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed everything before raising my threat to 23.\n\n \n\nAt the start of turn 3 I added a resource to all my heroes before drawing Northern Tracker.\n\n \n\nDuring planning I paid 1 resource from Glorfindel to play Song of Travel on Beregond.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Eomer and Glorfindel for a total of 7 willpower. In addition to the 2 in the staging area I drew East Bight Patrol for a total of 5 threat. 2 progress was placed on Great Forest Web, exploring it.\n\n \n\nSkipping the travel phase I was forced to engage the East Bight Patrol, who attacked Beregond. The shadow card was Dol Goldur Orcs, who increased the Patrol's attack to 4, which meant that they still did no damage to Beregond.\n\n \n\nI then attacked the Patrol with Glorfindel, killing them.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to 24.\n\n \n\nTurn four began with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Gandalf (Core).\n\n \n\nPlanning began with me paying 2 resources from Beregond to play another Defender of Rammas and 2 resources each from Eomer and Glorfindel to play Northern Tracker.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Glorfindel and the Northern Tracker for a total 8 threat. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew The Necromancer's Reach, which added 1 damage to Eowyn and the Northern Tracker. The total threat was 2 so I added 6 progress to stage 1B, exploring it and moving onto stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping the travel phase I engaged the Forest Spider, who attacked Beregond. The shadow card was Chieftain Ufthak, for no effect. The Forest Spider did no damage. Glorfindel and the 2 Defenders of Rammas attacked for 5, killing the Spider.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed all my cards before raising my threat to 25.\n\n \n\nTo kick off turn 5 I added a resource to each hero before drawing Gondorian Shield.\n\n \n\nWith nothing to do in the planning stage I committed Eowyn and Glorfindel as well as the Northern Tracker before discarding the Gondorian Shield in my hand for a total of 9 willpower.\n\n \n\nWith nothing in the staging area I drew another Forest Spider for a total of 2 threat. 7 progress was made, more than enough to explore stage 2B. I had to select a stage 3B and I hit lucky drawing “Beorn's Path”. \n\n \n\nSkipping the travel phase the Forest Spider attacked Celeborn. The shadow card was Great Forest Web, for no effect. The spider did no damage and Glorfindel and the 2 Defenders Of Rammas attacked for 5, killing it.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the episode I refreshed all the cards and raised my threat to 26.\n\n \n\nTurn six started with me adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Feint. I proceeded to pay 2 resources each from Eomer and Glorfindel to play another Northern Tracker.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Glorfindel and 2 Northern Trackers for a total of 9 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Dol Goldur Beastmaster for a total of 2 threat. 7 progress was placed on stage 3B.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping travel the Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacked Beregond. The shadow cards were Enchanted Stream and Mountains of Mirkwood for no effect and the attack did no damage before Beregond refreshed by exhausting Unexpected Courage.\n\n \n\nBeregond, Glorfindel and the 2 Defenders of Rammas then attacked, killing the Dol Goldur Beastmaster before I ended the turn by refreshing all my cards and raising my threat to 27.\n\n \n\nTurn 7 began with me adding resources before drawing Arwen Undomiel. \n\n \n\nDuring planning I paid 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Eowyn to play Arwen Undomiel.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Glorfindel, Arwen Undomiel and 2 Northern Trackers for 11 willpower. With the staging area still empty I drew Hummerhorns for a total of 1 threat. 10 progress was made, far more than I needed to complete stage 3B and win the game.\n\n \n\nThe final score was:\n\n \n\nCompleted turns (6): 60\n\nThreat: 27\n\nDamage: 1\n\nTotal Score: 88\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1380583","commentId":1380583,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1419459319,"content":"GAME 193: PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (PROGRESSION)\nHeroes: Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas\n\nTrying this with a new hero combo for my efforts using only cards from the core set.

The replacement card was Evil Crow, which made for a total 6 threat. I raised my threat to 29.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping travel I engaged the Evil Crow, who attacked the Westfold Outrider I.

In addition to the 4 threat in the staging area I drew Lure of the Ring, which forced me to exhaust the One Ring before surging to Banfurlong for a total 6 threat. My threat increased to 31.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping travel I optionally engaged Black Rider I who attacked the Westfold Outrider. The shadow card was another Black Rider for no effect and the attack over-killed Westfold Outrider I.\n\n \n\nThe death of Westfold Outrider I buffed Eomer, who, alongside Hama attacked Black Rider I for a whopping 10 damage, killing it.\n\n \n\nTo end the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat.\n\n \n\nTURN THREE\n\n \n\nEomer (with Firefoot).\n\nEowyn (1 resource).\n\nFrodo (1 resource, with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).\n\nHama.\n\n \n\nWestfold Horse-Breeder I.\n\n \n\nThreat: 32.\n\nHand: Feint, Guthlaf, Hasty Stroke, Song of Travel and Westfold Outrider.\n\n \n\nStage: 1B (0/1 progress).\n\nActive Location: Bag End (0/3 progress).\n\nGandalf's Delay.\n\nStaging Area: Banfurlong.\n\n \n\nI started the turn by adding a resource to all my heroes before drawing Rohan Warhorse.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 1 resource each from Eomer and Hama to play Guthlaf.

In addition to the 3 threat in the staging area I drew another Black Rider, which I paid 1 resource from Frodo and exhausted The One Ring to shuffle back into my deck. The replacement card was Gildor Inglorion which became a ally. The total threat was 2. 3 progress was placed on Bag End, which was explored, allowing me to draw Westfold Horse-Breaker before Bag End was added to the victory display.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Banfurlong I refreshed all my cards before discarding Gildon Inglorion and raising my threat.\n\n \n\nTURN FOUR\n\n \n\nEomer (with Firefoot).\n\nEowyn (2 resources).\n\nFrodo (with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).\n\nHama.\n\n \n\nGuthlaf, Westfold Horse-Breeder I.\n\n \n\n \n\nThreat: 33.\n\nHand: Feint, Hasty Stroke, Rohan Warhorse, Westfold Horse-Breaker and Westfold Outrider.\n\nVictory Points: 1 (Bag End).\n\n \n\nStage: 1B (0/1 progress).\n\nActive Location: Banfurlong (0/2 progress).\n\nGandalf's Delay.\n\nStaging Area: Empty.\n\n \n\nI started the turn by adding resources before drawing Spear Of The Mark.\n\n \n\nMoving on to planning I paid 1 resource from Eomer to play Spear of the Mark on him before paying 1 resource from Hama to play Rohan Warhorse on him.

With no threat in the staging area I drew Black Steed which was discarded after surging to Lure of The Ring, which forced me to exhaust the One Ring before surging to Crawling Towards Him, which I did nothing to avoid a Hide 2 test. The draws were Stock Road and Evil Crow for 5 threat. The Hide test failed with no ill-effects.\n\n \n\nIn the end the threat total was 0 so 2 progress was placed on Banfurlong, exploring it and sending it to the staging area before I added 4 progress to stage 1B, exploring it.\n\n \n\nStage 2B forced me to add a Black Rider to the staging area before I skipped the travel phase and optionally engaged the Black Rider.\n\n \n\nThe Black Rider attacked Guthlaf. The shadow card was the Marish, buffing the Black Rider and making Guthlaf even more dead than he would have been.\n\n \n\nBuffed by Guthlaf's sacrifice, Eomer and Hama attacked the Black Rider for 11 damage, killing it.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat again.\n\n \n\nTURN FIVE\n\n \n\nEomer (with Firefoot, Song of Travel and Spear of the Mark).\n\nEowyn (1 resource).\n\nFrodo (1 resource, with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).\n\nHama (with Rohan Warhorse).\n\n \n\nWestfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeder I.\n\n \n\nThreat: 34.\n\nHand: Feint, Hasty Stroke and Westfold Outrider.\n\nVictory Points: 2 (Bag End, Banfurlong).\n\n \n\nStage: 2B (0/14 progress).\n\nActive Location: None.\n\nGandalf's Delay.\n\nStaging Area: Empty.\n\n \n\nI started the turn by adding resources before drawing Unexpected Courage.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 1 resource each from Eomer and Hama to play Westfold Outrider I. I then paid 2 resources from Eowyn to play Unexpected Courage on Eomer.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Westfold Horse-Breeder I and Westfold Horse-Breaker I for 6 total willpower. I then drew Piercing Cry, which forced me to add a Black Rider from the encounter deck engaged with me. I then made 6 progress towards stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping travel and encounter phases the Black Rider attacked Westfold Outrider I. The shadow card was Have You Seen Baggins? Which did nothing before the Black Rider killed Westfold Outrider I.\n\n \n\nBuffed by the death of the Outrider, Eomer and Hama attacked the Black Rider for 11 damage, killing it.\n\n \n\nTo end the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat again.\n\n \n\nTURN SIX\n\n \n\nEomer (with Firefoot, Song of Travel, Spear of the Mark and Unexpected Courage).\n\nEowyn.\n\nFrodo (2 resource, with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).\n\nHama (with Rohan Warhorse).\n\n \n\nWestfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeder I.\n\n \n\nThreat: 35.\n\nHand: Feint and Hasty Stroke.\n\nVictory Points: 2 (Bag End, Banfurlong).\n\n \n\nStage: 2B (6/14 progress).\n\nActive Location: None.\n\nGandalf's Delay.\n\nStaging Area: Empty.\n\n \n\nI started by adding a resource to my heroes before drawing Mustering the Rohirrim, which I immediately played to pull the last Westfold Outrider out of my deck.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 1 resource each from Eomer and Hama to play Westfold Outrider I.\n\n \n\nDuring the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Westfold Horse-Breaker I and Westfold Horse-Breeder I for 6 willpower. I then drew Have You Seen Baggins?, which I paid 1 resource from Frodo and exhausted the One Ring to reshuffle back into my deck. The replacement card was Pathless Country for a total of 2 threat. 4 progress was placed on stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Pathless Country, I refreshed all my cards and raised my threat.\n\n \n\nTURN SEVEN\n\n \n\nEomer (with Firefoot, Song of Travel, Spear of the Mark and Unexpected Courage).\n\nEowyn (1 resource).\n\nFrodo (2 resource, with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).\n\nHama (with Rohan Warhorse).\n\n \n\nWestfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeder I, Westfold Outrider I.\n\n \n\nThreat: 36.\n\nHand: Feint and Hasty Stroke.\n\nVictory Points: 2 (Bag End, Banfurlong).\n\n \n\nStage: 2B (10/14 progress).\n\nActive Location: Pathless Country (0/3 progress).\n\nGandalf's Delay.\n\nStaging Area: Empty.\n\n \n\nAt the start of the turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Citadel Plate.\n\n \n\nDuring the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Westfold Horse-Breaker I and Westfold Horse-Breeder I for 6 willpower. I then drew another Pathless Country for 2 threat. 3 progress was placed on the active Pathless Country, exploring it before adding 1 progress to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to the new Pathless Country I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat.\n\n \n\nTURN EIGHT\n\n \n\nEomer (with Firefoot, Song of Travel, Spear of the Mark and Unexpected Courage).\n\nEowyn (1 resource).\n\nFrodo (2 resource, with Mister Underhill and the One Ring).\n\nHama (with Rohan Warhorse).\n\n \n\nWestfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeder I, Westfold Outrider I.\n\n \n\nThreat: 37.\n\nHand: Citadel Plate, Feint and Hasty Stroke.\n\nVictory Points: 2 (Bag End, Banfurlong).\n\n \n\nStage: 2B (11/14 progress).\n\nActive Location: Pathless Country (0/3 progress).\n\nGandalf's Delay.\n\nStaging Area: Empty.\n\n \n\nI started the turn by adding a resource to my heroes before drawing Westfold Horse-Breeder.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 1 resource from Eowyn to play Westfold Horse-Breeder II, which drew nothing from my deck.\n\n \n\nDuring the planning phase I committed Eowyn, Westfold Horse-Breaker and Westfold Horse-Breeder's I & II for a total of 7 willpower. I then drew Hunting For The Ring, which added 2 to my threat and made for a total of 0 willpower. 7 progress was made, 3 of which explored Pathless Country and 3 explored stage 2B.\n\n \n\nStage 3A added Buckleberry Ferry to the staging area and Stage 3B added another Black Rider to the staging area.\n\n \n\nDuring the travel phase I committed Frodo and Eomer to make a Hide 3 test with 3 willpower (I then exhausted Unexpected Courage to refresh Eomer). The three cards were 2 Crawling Towards Him and The Ring Draws Them for no threat. I successfully travelled to the Buckleberry Ferry.\n\n \n\nIn the encounter phase I engaged the Black Rider, who attacked the new Westfold Outrider I. The shadow card was Hunting For The Ring, for no effect so the Black Rider killed Westfold Outrider I before the buffed Eomer and Hama attacked it for 11, killing the Black Rider.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat again.\n\n \n\nTURN NINE\n\n\nEomer (1 resource, with Firefoot, Song of Travel, Spear of the Mark and Unexpected Courage).\n\nEowyn (1 resource).\n\nFrodo (3 resources, with Mister Underhill and The One Ring).\n\nHama (with Rohan Warhorse).\n\n \n\nWestfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeders I & II.\n\nThreat: 40.\n\nHand: Citadel Plate, Feint, Hasty Stroke.\n\n \n\nStage 3B.\n\nActive Location: Buckleberry Ferry (0/9 progress).\n\nGandalf's Delay.\n\nStaging Area: Empty.\n\n \n\nTo start the turn I added a resource to my heroes before drawing Escort From Edoras.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 2 resources from Eowyn to play Escort From Edoras I.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Eomer (exhausting Unexpected Courage to ready him), Eowyn, Frodo, Westfold Horse-Breaker I, Westfold Horse-Breeder I & II and Escort From Edoras I. This gave me a impressive 14 willpower.\n\n \n\nNeeding 9 progress to complete the quest and knowing that I had nothing in the staging area I drew Green Hill Country for 2 threat. 12 progress was made, 3 more than I needed to explore the Buckleberry Ferry and complete the quest.\n\n \n\nTo end the quest I decided to add Gandalf's Delay and Mister Underhill to the campaign pool.\n\n \n\nMy final score was:\n\n \n\nCompleted turns (8): 80\n\nThreat: 40.\n\nHero Damage: 0.\n\nVP: 2\n\nTotal Score: 118."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1420630","commentId":1420630,"userName":"Jizzy","timestamp":1422172816,"content":"Can you post your deck you used when you log?

This gave me a threat of 29.\n\n \n\nMy starting hand was Defender of the Nalth, Galadhon Archer, Galadhrim Minstrel x2, Gandalf (Core) and Orophin.\n\n \n\nSince I didn't get certain cards I decided to mulligan, drawing Defender of the Nalth, Feint, Mirkwood Runner, O Lorien!, Silvan Tracker and Silverlode Archer.\n\n \n\nQuest set-up consisted of adding Forest Spider and Old Forest Road to the staging area.\n\n \n\nTurn One began with me adding resources to my heroes before drawing Elven Mail.\n\n \n\nDuring planning I paid 1 resource from Celeborn to play O Lorien on Celeborn before exhausting O Lorien and paying 1 resource each from Haldir and Legolas to play Defender of the Nalth I.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn and Haldir for 5 willpower. In addition to the 3 threat in the staging area I drew Driven By Shadow, which pushed the threat to 5. No progress was added.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Old Forest Road and readying Haldir, the Forest Spider attacked the buffed Defender of the Nalth I doing no damage. Haldir and Legolas then attacked for 6 damage, killing the Forest Spider and adding 2 progress to Old Forest Road.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 30.\n\n \n\nTurn Two began with me adding a resource to my heroes before drawing Bow of the Galadhrim.\n\n \n\nIn the planning stage I paid 1 resource from Legolas to play Bow of the Galadhrim on Haldir.\n\n \n\nDuring the quest phase I committed Celeborn for 3 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew The Necromancer's Reach, which added 1 wound to Celeborn. 1 progress was added to Old Forest Road, discarding it before 2 progress was added to stage 1B.\n\n \n\nTo end the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to 31.\n\n \n\n \n\nTurn Three began with me adding resources before I drew another Elven Mail.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I exhausted O Lorien before paying 2 resources from Haldir to play Silvan Tracker I.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn and Silvan Tracker I for 5 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Dol Goldur Orcs, which inflicted 2 damage on Silvan Tracker I and made for total of 2 threat. 3 progress was added to stage 1B.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping travel the Dol Goldur Orcs attacked Defender of the Nalth I, doing no damage. In response, Haldir and Legolas attacked the Dol Goldur Orcs and killed them, adding 2 progress to stage 1B.\n\n \n\nI ended the turn by refreshing my cards, removing a wound from Celeborn and Silvan Tracker I (thanks to the afore-mentioned Silvan Tracker) and raised my threat to 32.\n\n \n\nTurn Four began with me adding resources before drawing Feint.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I exhausted O Lorien before paying 2 resources from Celeborn to play Silverlode Archer I.\n\n \n\nDuring questing I committed Celeborn, Silvan Tracker I and Silverlode Archer I for 6 total willpower. With a still-empty staging area I drew Forest Gate for a total 2 threat. 4 progress was made, more than enough to explore stage 1B and move onto stage 2B.\n\n \n\nI opted to travel to Forest Gate, which allowed me to draw O Lorien and The Tree People before I ended the turn by refreshing all my cards, healing the last wound on Silvan Tracker I and raising my threat to 33.\n\n \n\nTurn Five began with me adding resources before drawing Rivendell Blade.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 1 resource from Legolas to play Rivendell Blade on Haldir. I then exhausted O Lorien and paid 2 resources from Haldir to play Mirkwood Runner I. I then ended the phase by paying 2 resources from Legolas to play Elven Mail on Defender of the Nalth I.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn, Silvan Tracker I, Silverlode Archer I and Mirkwood Runner I for 7 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Old Forest Road for 1 threat. 6 progress was made, 4 discarded Forest Gate and the last 2 explored stage 2B.\n\n \n\nThankfully, the stage 3B was “Beorn's Path” so I travelled to Old Forest Road before risking playing The Tree People, returning Mirkwood Runner I to my hand and putting Galadhrim Minstrel I into play. Her ability allowed me to pull another The Tree People into my hand so I did the same thing again, putting Galadhrim Minstrel into my hand and putting Henamarth Riversong into play. I then exhausted Henamarth to look at the top card of the deck, Chieftain Ufthak, and return him to the top of the deck.\n\n \n\nI then refreshed all my cards before raising my threat to 34.\n\n \n\nTurn Six began with me adding resources before drawing Wingfoot.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 1 resource from Haldir to play Wingfoot on him before exhausting O Lorien and paying another resource from Haldir to play Galadhrim Minstrel I. I then failed to pull a event using her ability.\n\n \n\nKnowing what was coming I committed Celeborn, Haldir (calling “Enemy” for Wingfoot), Silvan Tracker I and Galadhrim Minstrel I for 8 willpower. With a empty staging area I unsurprisingly drew Chieftain Ufthak for 2 threat (which readied Haldir). 6 progress was made, the first 3 discarded Old Forest Road and the last 3 were added to stage 3B.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping travel Chieftain Ufthak attacked Defender of the Nalth I, doing 1 damage. In response Haldir, Legolas and Silverlode Archer I attacked for 9 damage, killing Chieftain Ufthak, adding him to the victory display and adding 2 progress to stage 3B. I then exhausted Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the deck, Caught In A Web, before returning it to the top of the deck.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed all my cards, healed the wound on Defender of the Nalth I and raised my threat to 35.\n\n \n\nTurn Seven began with me adding resources before drawing Orophin.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping planning I committed everyone but the Defender of the Nalth I for a total of 10 willpower. The draw was Caught In A Web, which I placed on Celeborn since the 10 progress was more than enough to explore stage 3B and end the game.\n\n \n\nMy final score was:\n\nCompleted Turns (6): 60\n\nThreat: 35.\n\nVP: 4\n\nTotal Score: 91\n\nEdited January 28, 2015 by silverthorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1425499","commentId":1425499,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1422478664,"content":"GAME 203: JOURNEY DOWN THE ANDUIN\n\n\nDeck: Mark II: http://community.fan...-my-solo-decks/ [/]\n\n\n \n\n\nFor this I decided to stick with the all-Silvan hero combo consisting of Celeborn, Haldir & Legolas.

In addition to the 1 threat in the staging area I drew Evil Storm, for no effect. I made 2 progress and added them to stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter skipping the travel phase I was engaged by the Hill Troll, attacking Defender of the Nalth I, attacking him for 6, killing him and raising my threat to 32.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs a counter attack, Haldir, Legolas and the buffed Galadhon Archer I attacked for 9, doing 6 more damage to the Hill Troll.\n\n\n \n\n\nI ended the turn by refreshing my cards before raising my threat to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Three began with me adding resources before drawing another The Tree People.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the planning phase I exhausted O Lorien before paying 2 resources from Haldir to play Silvan Tracker I.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn and the buffed Silvan Tracker I for a total of 5 willpower.

In addition to the 2 threat already in play I drew Evil Storm, which had no effect and Necromancer's Pass for a total of 5 threat. 1 progress was placed on stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nI opted to travel to Necromancer's Pass, discarding Heir of Mardil & Sneak Attack.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to 35.\n\n\n \n\n\nI started Turn Five by adding resources before drawing Gandalf (Core).\n\n\n \n\n\nMoving onto planning I exhausted O Lorien before paying 1 resource from Legolas to play Galadhon Archer I.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn and Silvan Tracker before spending 1 resource from Celeborn to Sneak Attack in Gandalf and use his ability to lower my threat to 30. I then committed Gandalf for a total of 8 willpower.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew The Necromancer's Reach (which added a wound to Celeborn, Silvan Tracker I and Gandalf) and Goblin Sniper for a total of 4 threat. 4 progress was made, 2 explored Necromancer's Pass and 2 were added to stage 2B. I then returned Gandalf to my hand.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter not travelling I used Haldir's special ability to (fittingly enough) snipe the Goblin Sniper and kill him\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards, used Silvan Tracker to heal one wound from Celeborn and Silvan Tracker I before raising my threat to 31..\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Six started with me adding resources before I drew another Galadhon Archer.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the planning phase I paid 3 resources from Celeborn and 1 resource each from Haldir and Legolas to play Gandalf, again using his special ability to drop my threat to 26.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the quest phase I committed Celeborn, Silvan Tracker I and Gandalf for 8 willpower.\n\n\n \n\n\nWith 2 threat in the staging area I drew The Necromancer's Reach again, adding 1 damage to Celeborn, Silvan Tracker I and Gandalf, and Dol Goldur Beastmaster for a total of 4 threat. 4 progress was placed on stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter travelling to the Enchanted Stream the Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacked Rumil. After both shadow cards did nothing Rumil was killed before Haldir and Legolas attacked and killed the Beastmaster, adding 2 progress to and exploring the Enchanted Stream.\n\n\n \n\n\nI ended the turn by refeshing all my cards, healing Celeborn and Silvan Tracker, before raising my theat to 27 and discarding Gandalf.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Seven began with me adding resources before I drew Defender of the Nalth.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the planning phase I exhuasted O Lorien and paid 1 resource each from Celeborn and Haldir to play Defender of the Nalth I. I then paid 2 resources from Legolas to play Elven Mail on Defender of the Nalth I.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn and Silvan Tracker I for a total of 4 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Misty Mountain Goblins and The Brown Lands for a nasty 7 threat. My threat increased to 30.\n\n\n \n\n\nI opted to move to the Brown Lands, which discarded it immediately before I optionally engaged the Misty Mountain Goblins. The Goblins's attack removed 1 progress from stage 2B before they attacked Defender of the Nalth I. Even with their attack buffed by a Dol Goldur Orcs shadow card no damage was inflicted before Haldir and Legolas attacked, killing the Misty Mountain Goblins and adding 2 progress to stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nI ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 31.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the start of Turn Eight I added resources before I drew Rivendell Blade. I then paid 1 resource from Legolas to play the Rivendell Blade on Haldir.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn and Silvan Tracker I for 4 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Gladden Fields and Banks of the Anduin for 4 threat. No progress was made.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter travelling to Gladden Fields I ended the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo start Turn Nine I added resources before drawing Thror's Map.\n\n\n \n\n\nI paid 1 resource from Haldir and played Thror's Map on Legolas before exhausting O Lorien and paying 1 resource from Legolas to play Galadhon Archer II.\n\n\n \n\n\nHaving emptied my hand I committed Celeborn, Haldir, Legolas, Silvan Tracker I and Galadhon Archer I for 8 willpower.\n\n\n \n\n\nWith 1 in the staging area I drew The East Bight and Marsh Adder for a total of 5 threat. 3 progress was enough to explore Gladden Fields and add it to the victory display.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter travelling to the East Bight I optionally engaged the Marsh Adder. It attacked Defender of the Nalth I, doing 2 damage and raising my threat to 34. in return Galadhon Atcher I attacked, doing 2 damage to the Marsh Adder.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards, healed 1 damage from Defender of the Nalth and raised my threat to 35.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Ten began with me adding resources before I drew Gandalf (Core).\n\n\n \n\n\nIn planning I paid 4 resources from Celeborn and 1 from Haldir to play Gandalf. I then used his ability to drop my threat to 30.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring questing I committed Celeborn, Gandalf and Silvan Tracker for 8 willpower. With 1 threat in the staging area I drew Despair, which took 4 progress from stage 2B and Treacherous Fog, which boosted the threat total to 2. 6 progress was made, which explored the East Bight.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter travelling to Banks of the Anduin the Marsh Adder attacked Defender of the Nalth I. Unfortunately, the shadow card was Eastern Crows, which buffed Marsh Adder enough to kill the Defender of the Nalth. Haldir, Legolas and both Galadhon Archers then attacked for 10, killing the Marsh Adder and sending it to the victory display before adding 2 progress to Banks of the Anduin.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed everything, discarded Gandalf and raised my threat to 31.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Eleven started with me adding resources before drawing another Silvan Tracker. I then exhausted O Lorien before paying 2 resources from Haldir to play Silvan Tracker II.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn and both Silvan Trackers for 7 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Pursued By Shadows, which raised my threat to 35 and Banks of the Anduin for a total of 1 threat. 6 progress was made, 1 explored Banks of the Anduin and sent it to the top of the deck and 5 progress was added to stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter travelling to the Banks of the Anduin, I ended the turn by refreshing everyone and raising my threat to 36.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Twelve marked the turn where this went from a quest to a slog. It started with me adding resources before I drew Defender of the Nalth.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the planning phase I paid 1 resource from all my heroes to pay for Defender of the Nalth I(a).\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn, Haldir, Legolas, both Silvan Trackers and Defender of the Nalth I for 9 willpower. With nothing in the staging area I drew Banks of the Anduin and The East Bight for 2 total threat. 7 progress was made, 4 blew through Banks of the Anduin and sent it back to the top of the deck and 3 was placed on stage 2B,\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter travelling to the East Bight I ended the turn by refreshing all my cards and raising my threat to 37.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Thirteen began with me adding resources before I drew Galadhrim Minstrel. I then exhausted O Lorien before paying 1 resource from Haldir to play Galadhrim Minstrel I. She allowed me to pull The Tree People, which I immediately played to return Galadhrim Minstrel I to my hand and pull Mirkwood Runner I into play. I then paid 2 resources from Haldir to play Galadhrim Minstrel back into play. I failed spectacularly to pull a event.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn, both Silvan Trackers, Mirkwood Runner I and Galadhrim Minstrel I for a total of 9 willpower. In addition to the 1 threat in the staging area I drew Treacherous Fog, which buffs Banks of the Anduin and Eastern Crows, which surged to Driven By Shadow, which made a total of 5 threat. 4 progress was placed on East Bight.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Eastern Crows attacked Haldir, whose useless shadow card was the other Hill Troll. No damage was done and Legolas hit back, killing the Eastern Crows and adding 2 progress to explore The East Bight.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 38.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs turn fourteen began I added resources before drawing Wingfoot, which I immediately paid 1 resource from Haldir to play on Haldir.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Celeborn, Haldir (Naming “Enemy), Legolas, both Silvan Trackers and Galadhrim Minstrel I for a total of 9 willpower.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition to the 1 threat in the staging area I drew Necromancer's Pass and Pursued By Shadow, which raised my threat to 42. with a total threat of 4, 5 progress was made, enough to explore stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nStage 3B told me to draw 2 cards, two copies of Gladden Fields. Since there was no enemies in play I finally won the game.\n\n\n \n\n\nThis was a complete slog of a quest. I'm going to be making changes to the deck to add more threat reduction and probably card play options (since I was only able to use the card I drew each turn for about 5 turns at the end).\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the end, my final score was:\n\n\nCompleted Turns (13): 130\n\n\nThreat: 42\n\n\nVP: 10\n\n\nTotal Score: 162."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1428480","commentId":1428480,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1422655341,"content":"GAME 204: HUNT FOR GOLLUM (I know I skipped a quest but I'm having to play with a deck I'm not experienced with building so playing with, arguably the toughest solo scenario in the game was a bad idea).\n\nDeck: Mark III: http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/]\n\n \n\nFor this I decided to try a all-Lore deck consisting of Elrond, Glorfindel and Mirlonde, which gave me a 30 starting threat.\n\n \n\nFor my starting hand I drew Asfaloth, Bombur, Cloak of Lorien, Elf-Stone, Gandalf (Core) and Master of Law.\n\n \n\nTo set up the quest I added Signs of Gollum, guarded by Gladden Fields to the staging area.\n\n \n\nTurn One began with me adding resources before drawing another Asfaloth.\n\n \n\nI then paid 1 resource from Elrond to play Elf-Stone on Gladden Fields/Signs of Gollum before paying 1 resource each from Glorfindel and Mirlonde to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel.\n\n \n\nDuring the quest phase I committed Elrond for 3 willpower.

I proceeded to pay 1 resource from Elrond and Mirlonde to play Warden of Healing I.\n\n \n\nProceeding to questing I committed Elrond, Mirlonde and Warden of Healing I for 6 willpower.

With a empty staging area I drew Banks of the Anduin for 1 threat. 4 progress was made, 3 explored Gladden Fields, added it to the victory display and (thanks to Elf-Stone) allowed me to draw another Gandalf (Core) and Warden of Healing. I then attached Signs of Gollum to Elrond and added 1 progress to stage 1B before playing Treacherous Fog, which had no effect.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Banks of the Anduin I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to it before ending the turn by refreshing my cards and raising my threat to 33.\n\n \n\nTurn Three began with me adding resources before drawing Gildor Inglorion.\n\n \n\nDuring planning I paid 1 resource from Elrond and Glorfindel to play Gleowine.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Elrond and Mirlonde for 5 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew The Old Ford for 1 threat. 4 progress was made. 1 explored Banks of the Anduin and sent it back to the top of the encounter deck before 3 progress was added to stage 1B. I then selected to add Evil Storm into play which did nothing.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to The Old Ford I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to and explore The Old Ford before refreshing all my cards and raising my threat to 34.\n\n \n\nTurn Four began with me adding resources before drawing another Master of Law. I proceeded to pay 1 resource from Elrond and Mirlonde to play Warden of Healing I.\n\n \n\nProceeding to questing I committed Elrond, Mirlonde and Warden of Healing I for 6 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew another Signs of Gollum which was guarded by a useless Treacherous Fog. With no threat in play I made 6 progress, more than enough to complete stage 1B and move onto stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter adding Signs of Gollum to Glorfindel I refreshed all my cards before raising my threat to 35.\n\n \n\nTurn Five began with me adding resources before I drew Erebor Hammersmith. I then paid 1 resource each from Elrond and Mirlonde to play Erebor Hammersmith I, who returned the Elf-Stone from my discard pile to my hand.\n\n \n\nDuring questing I added Gladden Fields to the staging area before committing Elrond, Mirlonde, Warden of Healing I and Erebor Hammersmith I for 7 willpower.\n\n \n\nWith 3 threat in the staging area I drew The Eaves of Mirkwood. I then exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to and explore The Eaves of Mirkwood leaving a total of 3 threat. 4 progress was added to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Gladden Fields I refreshed everything and raised my threat to 37.\n\n \n\nTurn Six began again with me adding resources before drawing Self-Preservation. I then paid 1 resource each from Elrond and Mirlonde and 3 resources from Glorfindel to play Gildor Inglorion. I then paid 1 resource from Mirlonde to play Cloak of Lorien on Gildor Inglorion.\n\n \n\nDuring questing I added played Flooded which raised my threat to 38 and surged to Pursued By Shadow which raised my threat to 41 before I committed Elrond, Mirlonde, Warden of Healing I and Erebor Hammersmith I for 7 willpower. With a empty staging area I drew Eastern Crows for 1 threat. I then exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to Gladden Fields. Of the 6 progress made, 1 explored Gladden Fields and 5 was added to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nThe Eastern Crows attacked Bombur, doing no damage before Glorfindel killed the Eastern Crows and shuffled them back into the encounter deck. I ended the turn by refreshing my cards before I raised my threat to 42.\n\n \n\nAs I wished I had played Gandalf instead of Gildor I started Turn Seven by adding resources and drawing another Warden of Healing.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping planning I added Banks of the Anduin to the staging area before committing Elrond and Mirlonde for 5 willpower. With 1 threat in the staging area I drew The Eaves of Mordor for 3 total threat. The 3 progress I made explored stage 2B and I qualified for stage 3B.\n\n \n\nAfter exhausting Asfaloth and exploring Eaves of Mirkwood I travelled to Banks of the Anduin before ending the turn and raising my threat to 43.\n\n \n\nTurn Eight began with me adding resources and drawing Henamarth Riversong. I then paid all the resources on my heroes to play Gandalf (dropping my threat to 38) and Henamarth Riversong. I then exhausted Asfaloth to put 2 progress on Banks of the Anduin.\n\n \n\nGoing into questing I added Eastern Crows to the staging area before committing everyone for 18 willpower. In addition to the 1 threat in the staging area I drew False Lead, which removed one of the Signs of Gollum's but meant that I made 17 progress and after exploring Banks of the Anduin made 16 progress on stage 3B, completing the quest.\n\n \n\nAs far as the new deck went, the whole thing went better than I thought it would. I managed to get 3 Hunters from Mordor as part of a 'pick one' option. Several killed Eastern Crows made it so that I dodged all the Hunters. I think I'll keep going and see how the heroes do against trolls next game.\n\nEdited January 30, 2015 by silverthorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1436986","commentId":1436986,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1423181376,"content":"GAME 205: PASSAGE THROUGH MIRKWOOD (NIGHTMARE)\n\n\nDeck: Mark IV: http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/133239-my-solo-decks/]\n\n\n \n\n\nHaving discovered that my FLGS had gotten in the Nightmare packs for Heirs Of Numenor, I decided to give the Nightmare scenarios a try.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter sending him a message on the forum, MightyRauros gave me permission to use the format he uses for his website while I'm typing these up.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlayer Set-Up\n\n\nHeroes: Celeborn, Haldir of Lorien, Legolas.\n\n\nStarting Threat: 29.\n\n\nStarting Hand: Defender of the Nalth, Gandalf (Core), Horn of Gondor, O Lorien, Rumil and Sneak Attack.\n\n\n \n\n\nEncounter Set-Up\n\n\nAdded Forest Spider to staging area.\n\n\nAdded Old Forest Road to staging area.\n\n\nAdded Enchanted Stream to staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nRound One\n\n\nResource Phase\n\n\n+1 Celeborn (1), +1 Haldir (1), +1 Legolas (1).\n\n\nDraw: Daughter of the Nimrodel.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlanning Phase\n\n\nPlay O Lorien on Celeborn (-1 Celeborn).\n\n\nExhaust O Lorien.\n\n\nPlay Defender of Rammas I (-1 Haldir, -1 Legolas).\n\n\n \n\n\nQuest Phase\n\n\nCommit: Celeborn.\n\n\nTotal Willpower: 3.\n\n\nReveal: Enchanted Stream.\n\n\nTotal Threat: 7.\n\n\nThreat increased to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTravel Phase\n\n\nTravel to Old Enchanted Stream.\n\n\n \n\n\nEncounter Phase\n\n\nEngage Forest Spider.\n\n\n \n\n\nCombat Phase\n\n\nAdd shadow card to Forest Spider.

I made up the decks from the 'The Woodland Realms Unite' articles.\n\n \n\nThe one major difference was that deck 2 has a Black Arrow instead of one of the Henamarth Riversong cards.\n\n \n\nDeck 1 is 'The Elven Highborn', consisting of Celeborn, Elrond & Galadriel. This gave me a somewhat high 33 threat. The starting hand was A Test Of Will, Feigned Voices, Gandalf (Core), Lorien Guide, Nalth Guide and Silvan Refugee.\n\n \n\nSince there was no O Lorien in the hand I decided to mulligan, drawing Defender of the Nalth x2, Nalth Guide, Nenya, O Lorien and Sneak Attack.\n\n \n\nDeck 2 was 'The Spear Of Mirkwood', consisting of Haldir of Lorien, Legolas and Mirlonde. The starting threat was a lot lower 24. The starting hand was Elven Mail, Galadhon Archer, Mirkwood Runner, Pursuing the Enemy, Silvan Tracker and Unseen Strike.\n\n \n\nI decided to mulligan, drawing Black Arrow, Daughter of the Nimrodel, Feint, Foe-Hammer, Pursuing The Enemy and Unseen Strike.\n\n \n\nFor quest set-up I added The East Bight and Pursuit On The Shore, which surged to Smoking Blood, which then surged to The Necromancer's Reach, which did nothing. I ended set-up by adding a Hill Troll to the staging area.\n\n \n\nTurn One began with me adding resources to all the heroes before deck 1 drew Hasty Stroke and Deck 2 drew Mirkwood Runner.\n\n \n\nDuring planning deck 1 paid 1 resource from Celeborn to play O Lorien before exhausting O Lorien and removing a resource each from Elrond and Galadriel to play Defender of the Nalth I. Deck 2 played Black Arrow on Legolas.\n\n \n\nDuring the planning phase Celeborn, Elrond and Defender of the Nalth I committed. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Goblin Sniper and another The Necromancer's Reach, which did 1 damage to Celeborn and Elrond. This made for a total of 7 willpower against 3 threat. 4 progress was added to stage 1B before I travelled to the East Bight.\n\n \n\nDuring the encounter phase deck 1 engaged the Hill Troll before I paid 1 resource from Legolas to play Feint on the Hill Troll, stopping it's attack. In response, Haldir and Legolas (using the Black Arrow and sending it to the victory display) used Unseen Strike to push the total attack to 14 and kill the Hill Troll, send it to the victory display and add 2 progress to the active The East Bight. I then exhausted Galadriel to drop deck 1's threat to 32 and allow Deck 1 to draw Feigned Voices.\n\n \n\nAfter all that I added 1 damage to Celeborn  and Legolas from Goblin Sniper before I refreshed all the cards and raised deck 1's threat to 33 and deck 2's to 25. \n\n \n\nTurn Two began with deck 2 becoming first player before I added resources and deck 1 drew Silvan Refugee and deck 2 drew Hands Upon The Bow.\n\n \n\nDuring planning deck 2 paid 1 resource from Haldir and 2 from Mirlonde to play Mirkwood Runner I. Deck 1 paid 1 resource from  Galadriel to play Nenya on her. I then exhausted O Lorien before paying 1 resource each from Celeborn and Elrond to play Defender of the Nalth II.\n\n \n\nProceeding to questing I committed Celeborn, Elrond Mirlonde and Defender of the Nalth II before exhausting Galadriel and Nenya to add her willpower to Elrond's.\n\n \n\nIn addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Anduin Troll Spawn, which surged to another The Necromancer's Reach (which added 1 damage to Celeborn, Elrond and Galadriel) and another East Bight. This made for a total of 11 willpower against. 5 threat. 6 progress was made, 4 explored the active The East Bight and 2 was added to stage 1B.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to The East Bight the Anduin Troll Spawn attacked Defender of the Nalth I. The shadow card was Smoking Blood, which luckily had no effect although the attack killed the Defender of the Nalth. In response Haldir, Legolas and Defender of the Nalth II attacked for 8 (thanks to the buff Celeborn provided to Defender of the Nalth II), killing the Anduin Troll Spawn.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I added a wound to the Mirkwood Runner and Galadriel from the Goblin Sniper before I refreshed all the cards and raised Deck 2's threat to 26 and Deck 1's threat to 34.\n\n \n\nTurn Three began with making deck 1 first player and adding resources before deck 1 drew another Defender of the Nalth and deck 2 drew Daughter of the Nimrodel.\n\n \n\nPlanning began with deck 1 paying 1 resource each from Celeborn and Elrond to play Nalth Guide I, which allows Celeborn to quest without exhausting (which will be handy if there's another flaming The Necromancer's Reach in the deck). I then paid 1 resource from Galadriel to play Silvan Refugee I and exhausted O Lorien. Deck 2 paid 1 resource from Haldir and  Mirlonde to play Daughter of the Nimrodel I, then immediately exhausted her to take 2 damage off Celeborn.\n\n \n\nDuring questing I committed Celeborn, Elrond, Nalth Guide I, Silvan Refugee I and exhausted Galadriel and Nenya to add her willpower to Elrond. In addition to the 2 points in the staging area I drew The Brown Lands and Troll Attack, which surged to Chieftain Ufthak. This made for a impressive 15 willpower against 9 threat. 6 progress was made, exploring The East Bight.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to the Brown Lands and automatically exploring it before Chieftain Ufthak attacked Silvan Refugee I. The shadow card was Gladden Marshlands which fortunately added 1 to Chieftain's attack (I would much rather have that come up as a shadow card than come up as a encounter card with it's 10 threat). The buffed attack kills Silvan Refugee I before Haldir, Legolas and (of all people) Nalth Guide I attack for 8 and inflict 5 damage.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I add a wound to Celeborn and Mirlonde from Goblin Sniper before refreshing the cards and raising deck 1's threat to 35 and deck 2's threat to 27.\n\n \n\nTurn Four began with making deck 2 the first player before adding resources. Deck 2 then drew The Tree People before deck 1 drew Elrond's Counsel.\n\n \n\nDuring planning deck 2 played The Tree People, sending Mirkwood Runner back to the hand before playing Galadhon Archer I, who does 1 damage to Chieftain Ufthak, killing him and adding him to the victory display. Deck 1 then exhausted O Lorien so that I could pay 1 resource each from Haldir and Mirlonde to play Daughter of the Nimrodel II. I then immediately exhausted both Daughters to heal 2 wounds each from Elrond and Celeborn.\n\n \n\nProceeding to questing I committed Celeborn, Elrond, Nalth Guide I and Mirlonde before exhausting Galadriel and Nenya to buff Elrond. Deck 1 played Elrond's Counsel to buff Celeborn's willpower and drop deck 1's threat to 32. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Marshland Outlaws and Gladden Fields. This made for a total of 13 willpower against 7 threat. The 6 progress made was more than enough to explore stage 1B and proceed to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Gladden Fields the Marshland Outlaws performs a undefended attack on Elrond. The shadow card was Anduin Troll Spawn for no effect and the attack did 2 damage. In response, Elrond, Haldir, Legolas and Galadhon Archer I attacked for 12, killing the Marshland Outlaws and adding 2 progress to Gladden Fields.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn, Celeborn and Legolas took a wound from Goblin Sniper before I refreshed all my cards and raised deck 1's threat to 34 and deck 2's to 29.\n\n \n\nTurn Five began with deck 1 becoming first player before I added resources and deck 1 drew Galadhrim Minstrel and deck 2 drew Rivendell Blade.\n\n \n\nDuring planning deck 1 exhausted O Lorien before paying 1 resource from Elrond to play Galadhrim Minstrel I before pulling Elrond's Counsel into the hand. Deck 2 paid a resource from Legolas to play Rivendell Blade on Legolas. I then paid 2 resources from Haldir and 1 from Mirlonde to play Mirkwood Runner I.\n\n \n\nDuring questing I committed Elrond, Celeborn, Haldir, Mirlonde, Nalth Guide I, Galadhrim Minstrel and Mirkwood Runner I before exhausting Galadriel and Nenya to buff Elrond. Deck 1 played Elrond's Counsel on Elrond to buff Celeborn and drop deck 1's threat to 31. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Brown Water Rats, another Brown Water Rats and Pursued By Shadows which raised deck 1's threat to 33 and deck 2's threat to 33. This made for a total of 19 willpower against 4 threat. 15 progress was made, 1 progress explored Gladden Fields and sent it to the victory display before 14 progress was added to stage 2B. Having finally checked what Hands Upon The Bow does I paid 1 resource from Legolas to play it and target the Goblin Sniper in the staging area. The 6 attack killed the Goblin Sniper, adding 2 progress to stage 2B and exploring it. \n\n \n\nStage 3B forced me to draw 2 A Flooded Fords, Gladden Marshlands and Gladden Fields. Since both of the enemies in play have the Rat trait they discarded themselves and I won the quest.\n\n \n\nThe final combined score was:\n\nCompleted Turns (4): 40\n\nCombined Threat: 66.\n\nDamage on surviving heroes: 7\n\nVP: 12\n\nTotal Score: 101.\n\n \n\nthese decks seemed to work well although the fact that a lot of the cards are ones I never use made this a learning experience (I had forgotten that you can snipe out of combat with Hands Upon The Bow until turn 5. I could have used it to get rid of the pesky Goblin Sniper).\n\n \n\nI'm definitely going to keep these two decks since playing cards I don't use is a attraction after this much gaming.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1441615","commentId":1441615,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1423497785,"content":"GAME 206: ESCAPE FROM DOL GOLDUR (NIGHTMARE)\n\nDeck: Mark V:\n\n \n\nI decided to stick with the same Decks I played through Journey Down The Anduin with.\n\n \n\nDeck A is 'The Elven Highborn', consisting of Celeborn, Elrond & Galadriel. This gave me a somewhat high 33 threat. The starting hand was Defender of the Nalth, Feigned Voices, Light Of Valinor, O Lorien, Silverlode Archer and Sneak Attack.\n\n \n\nDeck B was 'The Spear Of Mirkwood', consisting of Haldir of Lorien, Legolas and Mirlonde. The starting threat was a lot lower 24. The starting hand was Mirkwood Runner, Ranger Spikes, Rivendell Blade, Rivendell Bow x2 and Unseen Strike.\n\n \n\nFor quest set-up I added the objectives: Dungeon Torch guarded by Hummerhorns, Gandalf's Map guarded by The Necromancer's Reach (which luckily discards after doing nothing) and Shadow Key guarded by Dungeon Jailer.\n\n \n\nStage 1B forced me to select a random hero to be the captive. I randomly selected Mirlonde for that 'honour'.\n\n \n\nTurn One began with me adding resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Galadriel: 1, Haldir: 1, Legolas: 1), before Deck A drew Nalth Guide and Deck B drew Pursuing The Enemy.\n\n \n\nDuring planning Deck A played O Lorien on Celeborn (Celeborn: 0), exhausted O Lorien and played Defender of the Nalth I (Elrond: 0, Galadriel: 0). Deck B played Rivendell Blade on Legolas (Legolas: 0).\n\n \n\nDuring the quest phase Deck A committed Celeborn, Elrond and Defender of the Nalth I. In addition to the 2 threat in play I drew Great Forest Web and Dungeon Labyrinth. This made for a total of 7 willpower against 5 threat, 2 progress was duly added to stage 1B.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Dungeon Labyrinth. The Dungeon Jailer attacked Deck A, targeting Defender of the Nalth I. The shadow card was Spider of Dol Goldur who added 3 attack for a total of 5 attack. This was enough to kill Defender of the Nalth I. Haldir and Legolas then attacked it, doing 5 damage, thanks to the Rivendell Blade on Legolas, and killed the Dungeon Jailer, sending him to the victory display and adding 2 progress to Dungeon Labyrinth. Deck A then added Shadow Key to Galadriel and raised their threat to 35. I then exhausted Galadriel to drop Deck A's threat to 34 and draw Nenya.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I added 2 resources to Dungeon Labyrinth and added a wound to Galadriel before refreshing all the cards and raising Deck A's threat to 35 and Deck B's threat to 25.\n\n \n\nTurn Two began with me adding resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Galadriel: 1, Haldir: 2, Legolas: 1) before Deck B drew Daughter of the Nimrodel and Deck A drew Mirror Of Galadriel. Deck A then exhausted O Lorien.\n\n \n\nDuring planning Deck B played Daughter of the Nimrodel (Haldir: 0). Deck A played Mirror Of Galadriel (Galadriel: -1) before exhausting it to pull Arwen Undomiel into my hand before discarding Sneak Attack. Deck A then played Nenya on Galadriel (Celeborn: 0).\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase Deck A committed Celeborn before Galadriel and Nenya exhausted to buff him. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Driven By Shadow and Dol Goldur Beastmaster. This made for a total of 7 willpower against 6 threat. 1 more progress was added to Dungeon Labyrinth.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping travel the Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacked Elrond. The shadow cards were Torture Chamber and Endless Caverns which had no effect so the attack did no damage. Haldir and Legolas then attacked the Dol Goldur Beastmaster for 6, killing it and adding 2 more progress to Dungeon Labyrinth.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I added a wound to Galadriel and added 2 resources to Dungeon Labyrinth before refreshing all my cards and raising Deck A's threat to 36 and Deck B's threat to 26. I then exhausted Daughter of the Nimrodel I to heal the 2 damage on Galadriel.\n\n \n\nTurn Three began with me making Deck A the first player and adding resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 2, Galadriel: 1, Haldir: 1, Legolas: 2) before Deck A drew Feigned Voices and Deck B drew Silvan Tracker.\n\n \n\nDuring planning Deck A exhausted O Lorien before playing Arwen Undomiel (Galadriel: 0) before I exhausted Mirror of Galadriel to pull Defender of the Nalth into my hand and discard Feigned Voices. They then played Defender of the Nalth I (Celeborn: 0, Elrond: 0).\n\n \n\nDuring planning Deck A committed Arwen Undomiel, Defender of the Nalth I, Celeborn and Elrond before exhausting Galadriel to add her willpower to Celeborn's. \n\n \n\nIn addition to the 3 threat in play I drew Sentinel of Shadow and Torture Chamber. This made for a total of 14 willpower against 10 threat. 4 progress was made, 3 finally explored Dungeon Labyrinth and 1 was placed on stage 1B.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Torture Chamber Haldir used his ability to attack the Hummerhorns in the staging area, killing them and sending them to the victory display.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I added a resource to Torture Chamber and a wound to Galadriel before refreshing my cards and raising Deck A's threat to 37 and Deck B's to 27.\n\n \n\nTurn Four began with me making Deck B first player and adding resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Haldir: 2, Legolas: 3) before Deck B drew Hands Upon The Bow and Deck A drew another Arwen Undomiel. Deck A then exhausted Mirror of Galadriel to pull Nalth Guide from the Deck and discarded Silverlode Archer before exhausting O Lorien.\n\n \n\nDuring planning Deck B played Silvan Tracker I (Haldir: 0) before Deck A played Light of Valinor on Elrond (Galadriel: 0) and Nalth Guide I (Celeborn: 0, Elrond: 0) meaning that Haldir could quest without exhausting this turn.\n\n \n\nDuring the quest phase Deck B committed Haldir and Silvan Tracker I and Deck A committed Celeborn, Elrond, Arwen (adding her buff to Defender of the Nalth I) and Nalth Guide I before Galadriel & Nenya exhausted to add her willpower to Celeborn's. In addition to the 2 threat in the staging area I drew Chieftain Ufthak and another Dungeon Labyrinth. This made for a total of 18 willpower against 5 threat. 13 progress was made, 6 explored Torture Chamber and the last 7 explored stage 1B and allowed me to proceed to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter skipping travel for tactical reasons Chieftain Ufthak attacked Defender of the Nalth I. The shadow card was Necromancer's Pass, which did nothing and the attack did no damage thanks to the buff provided by Arwen. Haldir, Legolas and Elrond then attacked Chieftain Ufthak for 8, killing him thanks to Legolas's Rivendell Blade and sending him to the victory display before adding 2 progress to stage 2B, which released Mirlonde with a wound on her. This also added Nazgul of Dol Goldur to the staging area.\n\n \n\nWith the job half-done I ended the turn by adding a wound to Galadriel before I refreshed all my cards, healing the wound on Mirlonde thanks to Silvan Tracker I's ability. I then raised Deck B's threat to 28 and Deck A's to 38. Deck B finally exhausted Daughter of the Nimrodel I to heal the damage on Galadriel.\n\n \n\nTurn Five began with Deck A becoming first player before I added resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Galadriel: 1, Haldir: 1, Legolas: 4, Mirlonde: 1) and Deck A drew Children of the Sea and Deck B drew The Tree People. Deck A then exhausted Mirror Of Galadriel to pull Galadhrim Minstrel into hand and discard Feigned Voices.\n\n \n\nIn planning Deck A played Nalth Guide II (Celeborn: 0, Elrond: 0) which allowed Haldir to quest this turn without exhausting. I then exhausted O Lorien. Deck B Played Mirkwood Runner I (Haldir: 0, Mirlonde: 0) before playing The Tree People, returning Mirkwood Runner I to the hand and put Rumil into play (unfortunately, I couldn't use his ability but he was the only Silvan ally in the top 5 cards) as well as playing Rivendell Bow on Mirlonde (Legolas: 3).\n\n \n\nDuring the quest phase Deck A committed Celeborn, Elrond, Arwen Undomiel (buffing Defender of the Nalth I) and both Nalth Guides before Galadriel and Nenya exhausted to buff Celeborn. Deck B committed Haldir and Silvan Tracker I. In addition to the 8 threat in the staging area I drew Dol| Goldur Orcs, which added 2 wounds to Celeborn, and Eyes Of The Forest, which forced Deck A to discard Children of the Sea and Deck B to discard Unseen Strike, Hands Upon The Bow and Pursuing The Enemy. All in all 18 willpower went up against 12 threat. 6 progress was made and added to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Dungeon Labyrinth Deck A engaged the Dol Goldur Orcs and the Nazgul of Dol Goldur. \n\n \n\nThe Nazgul of Dol Goldur attacked Defender of the Nalth I, killing him and the Dol Goldur Orcs attacked Nalth Guide II, killing her.\n\n \n\nIn response, Elrond attacked and killed the Dol Goldur Orcs and Haldir, Legolas, Mirlonde and Rumil attacked the Nazgul of Dol Goldur, doing 9 damage (again thanks to the massively useful Rivendell Blade) and killed the Nazgul with a barrage of Ranged attacks.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I added 2 resources to Dungeon Labyrinth and a wound to Galadriel before refreshing all the cards. The 2 wounds on Celeborn were healed thanks to Silvan Tracker I before I raised Deck A's threat to 39 and Deck B's to 29. at this point I played Dungeon Torch and Gandalf's Map to Galadriel, raising Deck A's threat to 43.\n\n \n\nTurn Six began with Deck B becoming first player. I then added resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Galadriel: 2, Haldir: 1, Legolas: 4, Mirlonde: 1).  Deck B proceeded to draw Foe-Hammer and Deck A drew Defender of the Nalth. Deck A then exhausted Mirror Of Galadriel to pull The Tree People into hand and discard Galadhrim Minstrel.\n\n \n\nPlanning began with Deck B playing Ranger Spikes into the staging area (Haldir: 0, Mirlonde: 0). Deck A played the Tree People, returning Nalth Guide I to the hand before playing Galadriel's Handmaiden I, who dropped Deck A's threat to 42. Deck A then exhausted O Lorien to play Nalth Guide I (Celeborn: 0) which allowed Haldir to quest without exhausting that turn before playing Defender of the Nalth I (Elrond: 0, Galadriel: 0). \n\n \n\nDuring questing Deck B committed Haldir, Mirlonde, Rumil and Silvan Tracker I while Deck A committed Celeborn, Elrond, Arwen (buffing Defender of the Nalth I), Galadriel's Handmaiden I, Nalth Guide I and Defender of the Nalth I before Galadriel and Nenya exhausted to buff Celeborn. In addition to the 2 threat in play I drew King Spider (which exhausted Galadriel's Handmaiden and Daughter of the Nimrodel but was caught on the Ranger Spikes) and Endless Caverns (which raised Deck A's threat back to 43 and Deck B's to 30) and surged to Sentinel of Shadow. This made for 21 willpower against 6 threat. 15 progress was made, 8 explored Dungeon Labyrinth and 7 explored stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Endless Caverns Haldir used his ability to attack the King Spider, doing 2 damage before I ended the turn by adding a wound to Galadriel before refreshing my cards, healing the wounds on Celeborn and raising Deck A's threat to 46 and Deck B's to 31. I then exhausted Daughter of the Nimrodel I to heal the wounds on Galadriel.\n\n \n\nTurn Seven began with me making Deck A first player and adding resources (Celeborn: 1, Elrond: 1, Galadriel: 1, Haldir: 1, Legolas; 5, Mirlonde: 1) before Deck A drew Elrond's Counsel and Deck B drew another Rivendell Blade.\n\n \n\nDuring planning Deck B played Rivendell Blade on Haldir (Legolas: 4).\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I added a Orc Guard to each deck before Deck A committed Celeborn, Elrond, Arwen (buffing Defender of the Nalth I), |Galadriel's Handmaiden I and Nalth Guide I before Galadriel and Nenya exhausted to buff Celeborn and I played Elrond's Counsel to buff Celeborn and drop deck A's threat back to 43. Deck B committed Silvan Tracker I, Rumil, Mirlonde and Haldir. In addition to the 2 threat in play I drew Dol Goldur Beastmaster and Cavern Guardian, who increased Deck A's threat to 44 and Deck B's threat to 32. This made it that I had a total of 22 willpower against 6 threat. 16 progress was made, enough to explore Endless Caverns and stage 3B and win the game.\n\n \n\nThis was a odd game, Deck A seems to work remarkably well but Deck B seemed to not draw a lot of the cards I expected to need. EFDG is a lot different quest in nightmare mode and I suspect I hit lucky with encounter card draw.\n\n \n\nMy final score was:\n\nCompleted Turns (5): 50\n\nCombined Threat: 76.\n\nDamage: 0\n\nVP: 14\n\nTotal Score: 112\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1441669","commentId":1441669,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1423500163,"content":"Please, stop this spam\n\nEdited February 9, 2015 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1442443","commentId":1442443,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1423527933,"content":"Spam?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1443049","commentId":1443049,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1423576007,"content":"I don't get mndela eithwr."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1443338","commentId":1443338,"userName":"13nrv","timestamp":1423588419,"content":"your quest summary is really interesting.\n\nEdited February 10, 2015 by 13nrv"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1443356","commentId":1443356,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1423589307,"content":"This is as far from spam as it gets.

Their starting hand was Ancient Mathon, Athelas, Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf (Core) and Strength Of Will x2.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 consisted of Aragorn (Tactics), Halbarad and Sam Gamgee with a starting threat of 30. The starting hand was Dunedain Hunter, Dunedain Watcher, Gandalf (Core), Halfling Determination, Son Of Arnor and Weather Hills Watchman.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo set up the quest I added Forest Spider and Old Forest Gate to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nI started turn 1 by making deck #1 first player and adding a resource to all the heroes before deck #1 drew Henamarth Riversong and deck #2 drew Heir Of Valandil.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning Deck #1 paid 1 from Frodo and Idraen to play Bilbo Baggins (who put a Hobbit Pipe into hand) before playing Hobbit Pipe on Frodo and paying 1 from Beravor to play Henamarth Riversong. Deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and Sam to play Weather Hills Watchman (who put a Ranger Summons into hand) and played Dunedain Hunter, who put Black Forest Bats into play engaged with deck #2. I then exhausted Henamarth Riversong to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Forest Spider, and returned it to the top of the deck.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Halbarad (thanks to his ability), Idraen and Sam Gamgee. The draws were Forest Spider and Driven By Shadow, which added 1 to the threat of the cards in the staging area. I committed 13 against 8 threat so 5 progress was added to stage 1B before the heroes travelled to Old Forest Road, which readied Sam Gamgee.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the encounter phase deck #2 optionally engaged a Forest Spider before deck #1 engaged the other Forest Spider.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Forest Spider engaged with deck #1 made a undefended attack against Frodo. The shadow card was Mountains of Mirkwood, for no effect and the attack raised deck #1's threat to 31. The Forest Spider engaged with deck #2 attacked the Dunedain Hunter. The shadow card was The Necromancer's Reach, for no effect and the attack did 2 damage. The Black Forest Bats attacked Weather Hills Watchman. The shadow card was Chieftain Ufthak for no effect and the attack did no damage. Aragorn attacked the Forest Spider, killing it before Aragorn's ability triggered and made the Forest Spider engaged with deck #1 engage deck #2. Halbarad and Sam attacked the Black Forest Bats, killing it.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter a productive combat phase I readied all cards before raising deck #1's threat to 32 and deck #2's to 31.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Two began with deck #2 becoming first player before I added a resource to the heroes. Deck #2 drew Sword That Was Broken and deck #1 drew Will Of The West.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn planning deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad to play Ranger Summons (adding a Ranger of the North into the encounter deck). Deck #1 paid 1 from Frodo to play Ancient Mathon on the active Old Forest Road. Henamarth Riversong exhausted to look at the top card of the encounter deck, Enchanted Stream, and returned it to the encounter deck.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the quest phase I committed Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Frodo, Halbarad (using his ability), Idraen and Sam Gamgee. I drew Enchanted Stream and Necromancer's Pass. I managed 13 against 5 threat. 3 progress explored Old Forest Road (Ancient Mathon allowed deck #2 to draw Dagger of Westernesse, Gandalf (Core) and Secret Vigil) and 5 progress was added to stage 1B, exploring it and moving to stage 2B. The heroes then moved to Enchanted Stream.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Forest Spider attacked Halbarad. The shadow card was Enchanted Stream, for no effect and the attack did no damage. Aragorn attacked the Forest Spider and killed it thanks to his defence lowering ability.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I readied everything before deck #2's threat increased to 32 and deck #1's increased to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Three began with deck #1 becoming first player before I added a resource to all heroes.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the planning phase deck #1 paid 1 from Frodo and 2 from Beravor and Idraen to play Gandalf (Core), using his ability to lower deck #1's threat to 28. Deck #2 paid 2 from Sam and 1 from Halbarad to play Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn before paying 1 from Aragorn to play Dagger of Westernesse on Aragorn. Henamarth Riversong exhausted to look at the top card of the encounter deck, yet another Forest Spider, and return it to the encounter deck.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the quest phase I committed Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Frodo, Gandalf, Idraen and Sam Gamgee. The draws were Forest Spider and Dol Goldur Orcs (which added 2 damage to Gandalf). I committed 16 against 7 threat. 2 progress explored Enchanted Stream (readying Idraen) and the other 7 progress was added to stage 2B, exploring it. The random stage 3B was 'Beorn's Path'.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter travelling to Necromancer's Pass, which forced deck #1 to discard Athelas and Will Of The West, deck #2 optionally engaged the Forest Spider and Dol Goldur Orcs, thanks to Halbarad's ability.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Forest Spider attacked Weather Hills Watchman. The shadow card was Mountains Of Mirkwood, which did nothing but the attack killed the Weather Hills Watchman. The Dol Goldur Orcs attacked Dunedain Hunter. The shadow card was The Necromancer's Reach, which did nothing. The attack finished off the Dunedain Hunter. Aragorn and Halbarad attacked and killed the Forest Spider.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I readied everything before discarding Gandalf and raising deck #1's threat to 29 and deck #2's to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Four began with deck #2 becoming first player before I added a resource to all heroes. Deck #2 drew another Sword That Was Broken and deck #1 drew Will Of The West.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn planning deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and Sam to play Heir of Valandil on Aragorn and paid 1 from Aragorn to play Secret Vigil on Dol Goldur Orcs. Deck #1\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Aragorn, Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Frodo, Halbarad (thanks to his ability), Henamarth Riversong, Idraen and Sam Gamgee. The draw was Great Forest Web and Eyes Of The Forest, which forced deck #2 to discard Halfling Determination and deck #1 to discard 2 Strength of Will and a Will Of The West. I committed 19 willpower against 2 threat. 2 progress explored Necromancer's Pass and the other 15 progress was placed on Stage 3B, exploring it and winning the game.\n\n\n \n\n\nThis was a lot different to playing with the all-Gondor decks. The far higher willpower made things more managable. In the end, the combined score was:\n\n\n \n\n\nCompleted Turns (3): 30\n\n\nCombined Threat: 62\n\n\nTotal Score: 92.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1601836","commentId":1601836,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1430494977,"content":"Bro, you have some serious time on your hands!

Their starting hand was Bill The Pony, Dunedain Huter, Farmer Maggott, Steward of Gondor and Sword That Was Broken x2.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Watchful Protectors consisted of Beravor, Frodo Baggins and Idraen for 30 starting threat. Their starting hand was A Test Of Will, Ancient Mathom, Gandalf (Core), Hobbit Pipe, Smoke Rings and Will Of The West. After due consideration I decided to mulligan, drawing Athelas, Fast Hitch x2, Gleowine, Northern Tracker and Wingfoot.\n\n\n \n\n\nQuest set-up consisted of adding Forest Spider and Old Forest Road to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn One saw the Protectors take first player before I added resources [Aragorn +1, Beravor +1, Frodo Baggins +1, Halbarad +1, Idraen +1, Sam Gamgee +1] before the Protectors drew Athelas and the Hunters drew Son Of Arnor.\n\n\n \n\n\nMoving to planning the Protectors played Wingfoot on Beravor [beravor -1] before the Hunters played Bill The Pony and Dunedain Hunter (whose ability pulled a Dol Goldur Orcs out of the encounter deck and engaged it with the Hunters) before playing Steward of Gondor on Halbarad [Halbarad -1, Sam Gamgee -1] then exhausted Steward of Gondor [Halbarad +2].\n\n\n \n\n\nProceeding to questing I committed Beravor (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Bill The Pony, Frodo Baggins, Halbarad, Idraen and Sam Gamgee. I then drew Dol Goldur Beastmaster (which readied Beravor) and Black Forest Bats (which removed Halbarad and Idraen from the quest). In the end I committed 8 against 6 threat so 2 progress was added to stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter I travelled to Old Forest Road (which readies Frodo Baggins) the Hunters optionally engaged Forest Spider before the Protectors engaged the Black Forest Bats.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Dol Goldur Orcs attacked Halbarad, doing no damage before the Forest Spider attacked Dunedain Hunter, inflicting 2 damage. The Black Forest Bats attacked Frodo, doing no damage.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn return, Beravor attacked and killed the Black Forest Bats and Aragorn attacked and killed the Dol Goldur Orcs. Aragorn's ability triggered and forced the Dol Goldur Beastmaster to engage the Hunters.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the round I readied everyone before the Protectors raised their threat to 31 and the Hunters raised theirs to 31.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Two began with the Hunters becoming first player before I added resources [Aragorn +1, Beravor +1, Frodo Baggins +1, Halbarad +1, Idraen +1, Sam Gamgee +1] before the Hunters drew Gondorian Spearman and the Protectors drew Wingfoot.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the planning phase the Hunters exhausted Steward of Gondor [Halbarad +2] before playing Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn [Halbarad -3] and Gondorian Spearman [Aragorn -2]. The Protectors played Northern Tracker [Frodo Baggins -2, Idraen -2] and Fast Hitch on Frodo Baggins [beravor -1].\n\n\n \n\n\nMoving onto the quest phase I committed Beravor (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Frodo Baggins (readying him with Fast Hitch), Halbarad, Idraen, Northern Tracker and Sam Gamgee. I then drew Mountains Of Mirkwood and Enchanted Stream. I managed 14 willpower against 4 threat. 3 progress was added to Old Forest Road, exploring it (and readying Idraen) before 7 progress was added to stage 1B, exploring it and moving to stage 2.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter travelling to Mountains Of Mirkwood and adding Forest Gate to the staging area I skipped the encounter phase.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacked the Gondorian Spearman (taking 1 damage from the Spearman) and killed him. The Forest Spider attacked Halbarad, inflicting no damage. The Dunedain Hunter counter-attacked, inflicting 2 damage on the Dol Goldur Beastmaster before Aragorn and Bill The Pony attacked the Forest Spider, killing it.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the round I refreshed everything before the Hunters raised their threat to 32 and the Protectors raised theirs to 32.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Three began with the Protectors becoming first player before I added resources [Aragorn +1, Beravor +1, Frodo Baggins +1, Halbarad +1, Idraen +1, Sam Gamgee +1] and the Protectors drew Gandalf (Core) and the Hunters drew Foe-Hammer.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter I exhausted Steward of Gondor [Halbarad +2] the Protectors played 2 Athelas on Beravor before the Hunters played Son of Arnor [Halbarad -3].\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Beravor (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Frodo Baggins (readying him with Fast Hitch), Halbarad, Idraen, Northern Tracker (adding a progress to Enchanted Stream and Forest Gate) and Sam Gamgee. I drew Great Forest Web and Forest Spider (which readied Beravor). I managed 14 willpower against 8 threat. 3 progress was added to Mountains Of Mirkwood, exploring it (which allowed The Protectors to add Henamarth Riversong to their hand and the Hunter to add Celebrian's Stone to their hand and readied Idraen). 3 progress was added to stage 2B, exploring it before I randomly selected “Beorn's Path”.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter moving to Forest Gate (the Protectors drew Gather Information and The Galadhrim's Greeting) the Forest Spider engaged the Protectors.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Forest Spider attacked Frodo, raising the Protectors threat to 33. The Dol Goldur Beastmaster attacked Halbarad, inflicting 1 wound.\n\n\n \n\n\nIdraen attacked Forest Spider, inflicting 1 damage. Aragorn attacked Dol Goldur Beastmaster, killing it. Aragorn's ability allowed the Hunters to engage the Forest Spider engaged with the Protectors before Dunedain Hunter and Bill The Pony attacked and killed the Forest Spider.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the round I refreshed all the cards before the Protectors raised their threat to 34 and the Hunters raised theirs to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Four began with the Hunters becoming first player before I added resources [Aragorn +1, Beravor +1, Frodo Baggins +1, Halbarad +1, Idraen +1, Sam Gamgee +1]. The Hunters drew Ranger Summons and the Protectors drew Ancient Mathom.\n\n\n \n\n\nMoving to planning the Hunters exhausted Steward of Gondor [Halbarad +2] before they played Ranger Summons [Halbarad -1] (adding a Ranger of the North to the encounter deck) and Celebrian's Stone on Sam Gamgee [Halbarad -2]. The Protectors played Fast Hitch on Sam Gamgee [beravor -1] and The Galadhrim's Greeting [Frodo Baggins -2, Idraen -1] (which lowered the Hunters threat to 31 and the Protectors to 32).\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Aragorn, Beravor (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Bill The Pony, Dunedain Hunter, Frodo Baggins (readying with Fast Hitch), Idraen, Northern Tracker (which adds a resource to Enchanted Stream (exploring it) and Great Forest Web), Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch) and Son Of Arnor. I drew Enchanted Stream and Dol Goldur Beastmaster. I committed 24 willpower against 6 threat. 3 progress was added to Forest Gate, exploring it (and readying Idraen) before 15 progress was added to stage 3B, exploring it and winning the game.\n\n\n \n\n\nThese decks work well straight from the article.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1630699","commentId":1630699,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1432212338,"content":"GAME: INTRUDERS IN CHETWOOD.\n\n\n \n\n\nI decided to try out the decks from the Elven Realms Unite articles on the site.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Elven Hightborn comprise Celeborn, Elrond and Galadriel with 33 starting threat.

I took the heroes from one deck I had been using and one of the heroes from the other and made up two decks without taking them from the FFG main news page.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #1 consisted of Eowyn, Haldir of Lorien and Idraen with a total of 29 threat. Their starting hand was Fast Hitch, Henamarth Riversong, Light Of Valinor, Song Of Travel and Warden Of Healing.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 consisted of Aragorn (Tactics), Halbarad and Sam Gamgee with a total of 30 threat. Their starting hand was Bill The Pony, Feint, Ranger Summons, Secret Vigil and Weather Hills Watchman.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition Frodo Baggins (with Mr. Underhill and The One Ring) was put into play attached to deck #1.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter putting Gandalf's Delay into play I added a Black Rider to staging area and made Bag End the active location.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn One began with deck #1 becoming first player before adding resources [Aragorn +1 (1), Eowyn +1 (1), Frodo Baggins +1 (1), Halbarad +1 (1), Haldir Of Lorien +1 (1), Idraen +1 (1) and Sam Gamgee +1 (1)]. Deck #1 drew Cloak Of Lorien and deck #2 drew Dunedain Hunter.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning deck #1 played Light Of Valinor on Haldir of Lorien [Eowyn -1 (0)] and Fast Hitch on Sam Gamgee [Haldir of Lorien -1 (0)] before deck #2 played Bill The Pony and Weather Hills Watchman, which added a Ranger Summons to deck #2's hand [Halbarad -1 (0), Sam Gamgee -1 (0)] before playing Dunedain Hunter, which unfortunately forced deck #2 to engage a Black Rider. On the upside, Sam was buffed for the rest of the round.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the quest phase I committed Eowyn, Frodo Baggins, Halbarad, Haldir, Idraen and Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch). Deck #1 drew Gildor Inglorion who was controlled for now by deck #1 before deck #2 drew Green Hill Country. I committed 16 against 6 threat so 3 progress was added to Bag End, exploring it, readying Idraen and allowing deck #1 to draw Light Of Valinor and deck #2 to draw Captain Of Gondor before adding Bag End to the victory display before another progress explored stage 1B. Stage 2B added another Black Rider to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter the Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country and made no optional engagements the Black Rider attacked Weather Hills Watchman. The shadow card was Stock Road, which had no effect but the attack killed the Watchman. In response Aragorn, Dunedain Hunter, Halbarad, Haldir Of Lorien and Sam Gamgee attacked and killed the Black Rider before Aragorn's ability forced one of the other Black Riders in the staging area to engage deck #2.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I readied all the cards before deck #1 raised it's threat to 30 and deck #2 raised to 31. I then retained Gildor Inglorion [Frodo Baggins -1 (0)].\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Two began with deck #2 becoming first player and gaining control of Gildor Inglorion before adding resources [Aragorn +1 (2), Eowyn +1 (1), Frodo Baggins +1 (1), Halbarad +1 (1), Haldir Of Lorien +1 (1), Idraen +1 (2) and Sam Gamgee +1 (1)]. Deck #2 drew Weather Hills Watchman and deck #1 drew The Galadhrim's Greeting.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning deck #2 played Weather Hills Watchman, which added Dunedain Warning to deck #2's hand [Halbarad -1 (0), Sam Gamgee -1 (0)] and Captain Of Gondor on Aragorn [Aragorn -1 (1)]. Deck #1 played The Galadhrim's Greeting, reducing deck #1's threat to 28 and deck #2's to 29 [Eowyn -1 (0), Idraen -2 (0)].\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring questing I committed Eowyn, Frodo Baggins, Halbarad, Haldir, Idraen and Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch). Deck #2 drew Stock Road and deck #1 drew Green Hill Country. I committed 15 willpower against 9 threat. 3 progress was added to Green Hill Country, exploring it and readying Idraen before 4 progress was added to stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter the Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country and decided against optionally engaging, the Black Rider engaged with deck #2 attacked Gildor Inglorion. The shadow card was The Ring Draws Them, which had no effect and the attack did 2 damage to Gildor. In response, Aragorn, Halbarad, Haldir and Sam Gamgee attacked and killed the Black Rider. Aragorn's ability triggered and forced the Black Rider in the staging area to engage deck #2. Bill The Pony, Dunedain Hunter and the Weather Hills Watchman attacked the new Black Rider and inflicted 1 point of damage.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I readied all cards before deck #2 raised it's threat to 30 and deck #1 raised to 29. I then paid 1 from Frodo to retain Gildor Inglorion.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn three began with deck #1 becoming first player before I added resources to my heroes. Deck #1 drew Arwen Undomiel and deck #2 drew Son Of Arnor.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning deck #1 paid 1 from Eowyn and Idraen to play Arwen Undomiel and paid 2 from Haldir to play Warden of Healing. Deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad to play Dunedain Warning on him and paid 1 from Sam Gamgee to play Ranger Summons and shuffle a Ranger of the North into the encounter deck.\n\n\n \n\n\nMoving to questing I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding her defence buff and Sentinel to Halbarad), Eowyn, Gildor Inglorion, Halbarad, Haldir, Idraen, Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch) and Warden Of Healing. Deck #1 drew Woody End and deck #2 drew Pathless Country. I committed 21 against 6 threat. 3 progress explored Green Hill Country and readied Idraen before 12 progress was added to stage 2B, exploring it and moving onto stage 3. Stage 3A added Buckleberrry Ferry to the staging area and stage 3B added another Black Rider to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter the Fellowship travelled to Pathless Country and decided against optionally engaging the Black Rider attacked Weather Hills Watchman. The shadow card was Green Hill Country, which buffed the Black Rider's attack and over-killed the Weather Hills Watchman. Aragorn, Bill The Pony, Halbarad and Haldir attacked the Black Rider, killing it before Aragorn's ability pulled the Black Rider into engagement with deck #2, which buffed Sam Gamgee, who attacked the Black Rider with Dunedain Hunter, doing 1 point of damage.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter readying all cards deck #1 raised it's threat to 30 and deck #2's to 31 before I paid 1 from Frodo to retain Gildor.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Four began with deck #2 becoming first player and all heroes gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Ranger Summons and deck #1 drew Waters Of Nimrodel.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the planning phase deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and Sam to play 2 Ranger Summons and shuffle 2 Rangers of the North into the encounter deck.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding her defence buff and sentinel to Halbarad), Eowyn, Frodo Baggins, Gildor Inglorion, Halbarad, Haldir, Idraen, Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch) and Warden Of Healing. Deck #2 drew Ranger Of The North, who attached to deck #1 and inflicted 2 damage to the Black Rider engaged with deck #1 before deck #2 drew Pathless Country. I committed 21 against 9 threat. 3 progress explored Pathless Country and readied Idraen.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter the Fellowship travelled to another Pathless Country and skipped the encounter phase the Black Rider's attack was neutralized when I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Feint. Aragorn, Halbarad, Haldir and Sam Gamgee attacked and killed the Black Rider.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I readied all the cards before deck #2 raised it's threat to 32 and deck #1 raised to 31 before I paid 1 from Frodo to retain Gildor.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Five began with deck #1 becoming first player and all heroes gaining a resource. Deck #1 drew Northern Tracker and deck #2 drew Defender Of Rammas.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning deck #1 paid 2 from Eowyn and Idraen to play Northern Tracker before deck #2 paid 2 from Aragorn to play Defender of Rammas.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding her defence buff to Defender of Rammas), Eowyn, Frodo Baggins, Gildor Inglorion, Haldir, Idraen, Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to all locations in the staging area and exploring Woody End), Ranger of the North, Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch) and Warden Of Healing. Deck #1 drew another Ranger Of The North, which attached to player #2 and added 2 progress to Stock Road, exploring it and readying Idraen before deck #2 drew Evil Crow. I committed 22 willpower against 5 threat so 3 progress explored Pathless Country.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #1 exhausted Haldir and Ranger of the North before drawing Have You Seen Baggins, Ranger of the North and Black Steed. I committed 4 willpower against 0 threat so the Felllowship travelled to Buckleberry Ferry.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 opted to optionally engage the Evil Crow, which buffed Sam before the crow attacked Defender of Rammas. The shadow card was Have You Seen Baggins, for no effect and the attack did no damage. Aragorn then attacked and killed the Evil Crow.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I readied all cards before deck #1 raised it's threat to 32 and deck #2 raised it's to 33 before I paid 1 from Frodo to retain Gildor.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Six began with deck #2 becoming first player and all heroes gaining resources before deck #2 drew Bow of Galadhrim and deck #1 drew Power Of Orthanc.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter skipping planning I committed Aragorn, Arwen Undomiel (adding her buff to Halbarad), Dunedain Hunter, Eowyn, Frodo Baggins, Gildor Inglorion, Halbarad, Haldir, Idraen, Northern Tracker, Ranger of the North x2, Sam Gamgee (readying with Fast Hitch) and Warden Of Healing. Deck #2 drew Evil Crow and deck #1 drew The Marish. I committed 30 willpower against 5 threat making more than enough progress to explored the Buckleberry Ferry and complete the quest.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the aftermath I chose to add The Ring Draws Them and Mr. Underhill to the quest log.\n\n\n \n\n\nMy final score was:\n\n\n \n\n\nCompleted Turns (5): 50.\n\n\nTotal Threat: 65.\n\n\nVP: 1.\n\n\nTotal Score: 114.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1660592","commentId":1660592,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1434394375,"content":"GAME: A SHADOW OF THE PAST.\n\n \n\nI decided to try something new, namely put together two Dwarf decks to put through the LOTR saga quests.\n\n \n\nDeck #1 was Bifur (who, thanks to drawing a low amount of Leadership Dwarves churned out a large number of Lore cards thanks to his ability as well as questing), Dain (who did what Dain always does and buffed everyone else) and Gloin (who quested but never got involved in a fight).\n\n \n\nDeck #2 was Gimli (who mostly defended and was healed by Self-Preservation since deck #2 didn't draw Unexpected Courage), Nori (who quested most turns or helped out on fights when needed, as well as dropping deck #2's threat most turns) and Thalin (who quested and damaged most enemies).\n\n \n\nThe game went well, as I said above everyone played their part and the two decks performed better than I expected.

After some consideration I decided to mulligan, drawing Descendant Of Thorandor, Ethir Swordsman, Gather Information, Gwalihir, Horn Of Gondor and Song Of Battle.\n\n\n \n\n\nQuest set-up consisted of adding Snaga Scouts, Wainriders and Wolves From Mordor to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn One began with me adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Feint.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter skipping planning I committed Eowyn and drew hit lucky, drawing a Ranger of Ithilien who was committed to the quest.

I committed a total of 10 willpower (thanks to the Ethir Swordsman's self-buffing ability) against 3 threat so 7 progress was added to stage 2B, more than enough to explore it and move to stage 3B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter skipping travelling I engaged the Uruk Vanguard, who attacked Beregond, doing no damage. Beorn, Eagles of the Misty Mountains and Ranger Of Ithilien attacked and killed the Uruk Vanguard.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I raised my threat to 35.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Five kicked off with my adding resources and drawing The Eagles Are Coming.\n\n\n \n\n\nI started planning by playing The Eagles Are Coming, drawing Landroval, The Eagles Are Coming and Vassal Of The Windlord. I then played the new The Eagles Are Coming, drawing another The Eagles Are Coming. I repeated the process with my last The Eagles Are Coming, drawing Eagles Of The Misty Mountains, Gwalihir and Landroval. I then paid 2 each from Beregond and Beorn to play another Eagles Of The Misty Mountains and paid 1 from Beorn to play Vassal Of The Windlord. I ended a productive phase by playing Horn Of Gondor on Beregond.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I discarded the Ranger of Ithilien and committed Eowyn and both Ethir Swordsman. I then drew Emyn-Arnen Overlook. I committed 10 willpower against 3 threat and added 7 progress to stage 3B, exploring it and proceeding to stage 4B, which added the Witch King to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter travelling to Captured Watchtower I decided to risk optionally engaging the Witch-King. The Witch-King's attack was stopped by my paying 1 from Beregond to play Feint before Beorn, Beregond, Eagles Of The Misty Mountains x2 and Vassal of the Windlord attacked the Witch-King, inflicting 7 damage on the Witch-King. The Vassal Of The Windlord was added as a attachment to one of the Eagles Of The Misty Mountains and added a resource to Beregond.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I decided to raise my threat to a total of 40 and keep the Witch-King engaged with me.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Six began with me adding resources before I drew Support of the Eagles (and it's about flipping time).\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning I paid 2 from Beregond and 1 from Beorn to play Support of the Eagles on Beregond.\n\n\n \n\n\nMoving onto questing I committed Eowyn and both Ethir Swordsman (with -1 willpower each). I drew Morgul Duin. I committed 7 total willpower against 3 threat so 2 progress explored Captured Watchtower and 2 progress was added to stage 4B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter skipping travel and encountering the Witch-King attacked Beregond, who exhausted Support Of The Eagles to buff his defence to 7. The shadow card was Cut Off, so I discarded a Gwalihir and the attack did no damage. Beorn and both Eagles of the Misty Mountains (one with a +1 attack buff) attacked and killed the Witch-King.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt this point in the proceedings I'm wondering why I ever stopped playing Beorn since he's a monster.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I raised my threat to 41.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Seven began with adding resources before I drew my last Ethir Swordsman.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning I paid 2 from Eowyn to play another Ethir Swordsman.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring questing I committed Eagles of The Misty Mountains x2, Eowyn and Ethir Swordsman x3 (supplying 12 willpower between them). I drew Massing At Osgilath, which surged. The surge card was another Morgul Duin, which raised my threat to 42. I committed 20 willpower against 4 threat so 16 progress was added to stage 4B, more than enough to explore it and win the game.\n\n\n \n\n\nThis game was more fun than most games I've played recently. Beorn is a monster and the card gods seemed to be on my side.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the end my score was:\n\n\nCompleted turns (6): 60.\n\n\nTotal Threat: 42.\n\n\nTotal Score: 102.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1694401","commentId":1694401,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1437072249,"content":"GAME: A SHADOW OF THE PAST.\n\n \n\nSince I just got my hands on Fog On The Barrow Downs I decided to play through all the quests from the LOTR saga so far.\n\n \n\nMy basic rule for the campaign was that I play for a win, but if I don't pick up the optional boons (or pick up too many burdens) but complete the quest then a win is a win. I won't retry the quest for a optimal result.\n\n \n\nI decided to use two decks: \n\n \n\nThe Elven Highborn consists of Celeborn, Elrond and Galadriel with 33 starting threat and a opening hand comprising Arwen Undomiel, Defender Of The Nalth, Elrond's Counsel, Galadhrim Minstrel and Silvan Refugee. Since I didn't get a great hand I decided to mulligan, drawing Children Of The Sea, Elrond's Counsel, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Nalth Guide and Nenya.\n\n \n\nThe Spears Of Mirkwood consists of Haldir Of Lorien, Legolas and Mirlonde with 24 starting threat and a opening hand comprising Elven Mail, Foe-Hammer, Galadhrim Minstrel, Hands Upon The Bow and Rivendell Bow.\n\n \n\nIn addition I added Frodo Baggins into play, with Mr. Underhill and The One Ring.\n\n \n\nQuest set-up consisted of putting Gandalf's Delay into play, making Bag End the active location and adding a Black Rider to the staging area.\n\n \n\nTurn One began with The Highborn becoming first player and all heroes gaining resources before the Highborn drew Defender Of The Nalth and the Spears drew Mirkwood Runner.\n\n \n\nPlanning consisted of the Highborn played Nenya on Galadriel [Galadriel -1 (0)] before the Spears played Galadhrim Minstrel [Haldir of Lorien -1 (0), Mirlonde -1 (0)], whose ability added Sudden Strike to the Spears' hand, as well as playing Rivendell Bow on Mirlonde [Legolas -1 (0)].\n\n \n\nDuring the quest phase I committed Celeborn (with a willpower buff from Galadriel and Nenya), Frodo Baggins and Galadhrim Minstrel (with a buff from Celeborn). The Highborn drew Have You Seen Baggins, which I decided to pay 1 from Frodo and exhaust The One Ring to reshuffle into the encounter deck. The Highborn's new draw was Woody End. The Spears draw was Gildor Inglorion. I committed 11 willpower against 5 threat. 3 progress explored Bag End and sent it to the victory display as well as allowing the Highborn to draw Lorien Guide. 1 progress explored stage 1B. Stage 2B added another Black Rider to the staging area.\n\n \n\nAfter the Fellowship travelled to Woody End the Highborn engaged one of the Black Riders in the staging area.\n\n \n\nThe Black Rider attacked Gildor Inglorion, doing 2 damage. In response, Elrond, Haldir, Legolas and Mirlonde attacked the Black Rider, inflicting enough damage to kill it. Legolas's ability triggered and added 1 progress to Woody End, exploring it and adding 1 more progress to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I discarded Gildor Inglorion and raised the Highborn's threat to 34 and the Spears threat to 25.\n\n \n\nTurn Two began with the Spears becoming first player and all heroes gaining a resource before the Spears drew another Galadhrim Minstrel and the Highborn drew Galadriel's Handmaiden.\n\n \n\nDuring planning the Spears played Galadhrim Minstrel [Haldir -1, Mirlonde -1], whose ability pulled the Tree People into the Spears' hand. The Spears proceeded to play The Tree People and return the Galadhrim Minstrel I played last turn to the Spears' hand to put Silvan Tracker into play. The Highborn played Nalth Guide [Celeborn -2], which made it that Elrond quests without exhausting this turn, and Defender Of The Nalth [Elrond -2, Galadriel -1].\n\n \n\nMoving to the quest phase I committed Celeborn (buffed by Galadriel and Nenya), Defender Of The Nalth (buffed and questing for free), Elrond (questing for free), Frodo Baggins, Galadhrim Minstrel (buffed), Nalth Guide (buffed and questing for free) and Silvan Tracker (buffed). The Spears drew Evil Crow and the Highborn drew Pathless Country. The Highborn then played Elrond's Counsel on Celeborn to add 1 willpower and drop the Highborn's threat to 31. I committed 17 willpower against 8 threat. 9 progress was added to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nAfter the Fellowship travelled to Pathless Country the Highborn optionally engaged Evil Crow, who attacked Defender of the Nalth, doing no damage.\n\n \n\nElrond and Legolas attacked and destroyed the Evil Crow. Legolas's ability triggered and added 2 progress to Pathless Country.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I raised the Spears threat to 26 and the Highborn's to 32.\n\n \n\nTurn Three began with the Highborn becoming first player and the heroes gaining a resource before the Highborn drew Defender Of The Nalth and the Spears drew Pursuing the Enemy.\n\n \n\nDuring planning the Highborn played Defender Of The Nalth [Celeborn -1, Elrond -1, Galadriel -1]. The Spears played Galadhrim Minstrel [Haldir -1, Mirlonde -1], who pulled Feint into the Spears' hand.\n\n \n\nMoving to the quest phase I committed Celeborn (with a buff from Galadriel and Nenya), Defender Of The Nalth (buffed and for free), Frodo Baggins, Galadhrim Minstrel (buffed), Galadhrim Minstrel, Nalth Guide and Silvan Tracker. The Highborn drew Evil Crow and the Spears drew Green Hill Country. I committed 15 willpower against 8 threat. 1 progress explored Pathless Country and 4 more explored stage 2B.\n\n \n\nStage 3 added Buckleberry Ferry and another Black Rider to the staging area.\n\n \n\nAfter the Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country the Highborn optionally engaged the Evil Crow and unoptionally engaged a Black Rider.\n\n \n\nThe Evil Crow made  a undefended attack on Celeborn, doing no damage (I've yet to draw a shadow effect this game) before the Black Rider attacked the buffed Defender of the Nalth, killing him.\n\n \n\nIn response Celeborn, Haldir, Legolas and Mirlonde attacked and killed the Black Rider engaged with the Highborn. Legolas's ability added 2 progress to Green Hill Country.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I raised the Highborn's threat to 33 and the Spears' to 27.\n\n \n\nTurn Four began with the Spears becoming first player and all heroes gaining resources before the Spears drew Henamarth Riversong and the Highborn drew O Lorien.\n\n \n\nDuring planning the Spears played Henamarth Riversong [Haldir -1] before the Highborn played O Lorien on Celeborn [Celeborn -1], exhausted O Lorien and played Galadriel's Handmaiden [Galadriel -1], who reduced the Highborn's threat to 32.\n\n \n\nThe quest phase commenced with me committing Celeborn (buffed by Galadriel and Nenya), Frodo Baggins, Galadhrim Minstrel x2, Galadriel's Handmaiden (buffed and for free), Henamarth Riversong (buffed), Nalth Guide and Silvan Tracker. The Spears' draw was Have You Seen Baggins, which I paid 1 from Frodo and exhausted The One Ring to reshuffle into the encounter deck. The replacement was Crawling Towards Them. After exhausting Mirlonde for 3 willpower I drew Bamfurlong and The Ring Draws Them for 2 so passed the Hide test. The Highborn drew Rode Like A Gale, which surged to Black Steed, which surged to Have You Seen Baggins, which attached to Celeborn. I committed 18 willpower against 3 threat. Of the whopping 15 progress I made, 1 blew through Green Hill Country and the other 14 progress was wasted.\n\n \n\nAfter travelling to Buckleberry Ferry the Evil Crow attacked the Defender of the Nalth, doing no damage. Elrond and Legolas attacked and killed the Evil Crow, adding 2 progress to Buckleberry Ferry.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the turn I raised the Spears' threat to 28 and the Highborn's to 33.\n\n \n\nTurn Five began with the Highborn becoming first player and the heroes gaining a resource before the Highborn drew Arwen Undomiel and the Spears drew Mirkwood Runner.\n\n \n\nDuring planning the Highborn did nothing and the Spears played Mirkwood Runner [Haldir -1, Mirlonde -2].\n\n \n\nAt this point I decided to risk going all in. I committed Celeborn (buffed by Galadriel and Nenya), Elrond, Frodo, Galadhrim Minstrel x2, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Haldir, Henamarth Riversong, Legolas, Mirkwood Runner (buffed), Mirlonde, Nalth Guide and Silvan Tracker. Deck #1 drew Stock Road and deck #2 drew Green Hill Country. I committed 26 willpower against 5 threat. The 21 progress I made blow straight through the 7 progress I needed and won the game.\n\n \n\nThese decks worked well (for 2 decks almost completely lifted from a article on the site). At the end of the game I opted to add the Boon Mr. Underhill and the Burden The Ring Draws Them to the campaign pool.\n\n \n\nIn the end my score was:\n\nCompleted turns (4): 40\n\nTotal Threat: 61.\n\nVP: 1.\n\nTotal Score: 100.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=1706508","commentId":1706508,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1438075243,"content":"A SHADOW OF THE PAST\n\n \n\nAfter trying out some other deck designs and getting nowhere I decided to go back to the two decks from the Elven Realms Unite articles and try the whole shebang again.

I then attached Old Bogey-Stories to Sam Gamgee.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn One began with deck #2 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Sword That Was Broken and deck #1 drew Escort From Edoras.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning deck #2 paid 1 each from Halbarad and Sam Gamgee to play Steward Of Gondor on Idraen, then paid 1 from Aragorn to play Arod on himself and played Dunedain Hunter, who brought a Army Of Flies into play engaged with deck #2.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter exhausting Steward Of Gondor to add 2 resources to Idraen, deck #1 paid 3 from Idraen and 1 from Eleanor to play Northern Tracker, then paid 1 from Beravor to play Wingfoot on Aragorn.\n\n\n \n\n\nMoving to the quest phase I committed Aragorn (naming Location for Wingfoot), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Idraen, Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to Wall of Trees and Misleading Path) and Sam Gamgee to the quest before deck #2 drew Deep Gulley (which readied Aragorn) and deck #1 drew Ending And Failing (raising deck #1's threat to 30 and deck #2's to 32).

Deck #1 drew Misleading Path (which gained 1 progress from Warden Of Arnor and reading Aragorn), which surged to Tom Bombadil, who was attached to deck #1 committed to the quest. Deck #2 drew Ending And Failing, which raised deck #1's threat to 35 and deck #2's to 37.\n\n\n \n\n\nI committed a total of 19 against 3 threat so 5 progress explored Oppressive Forest and the rest explored stage 2B. With 10 victory points I managed to travel to stage 3, where I added Old Man Willow and Withywindle to the staging area before drawing Wall of Trees and adding it the to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe fellowship travelled to Misleading Path.\n\n\n \n\n\nOld Man Willow attacked Tom Bombadil, drawing Grasping Root for no effect as a shadow card and discarding Wall Of Trees from the victory display to add 2 attack.

Deck #2 drew Song Of Sleep, which deck #2 exhausted The One Ring and paid 1 from Frodo to reshuffle back into the encounter deck where it was replaced by Ranger Of The North, who added 2 progress to Withywindle before joining deck #1. Deck #1 drew Deep Gulley (which readied Aragorn).\n\n\n \n\n\nI committed 19 against 8 so 2 progress explored Wall of Tress, 1 progress explored Misleading Path and 8 progress was added to stage 3B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter the Fellowship travelled to Deep Gulley, Old Man Willow attacked Gandalf. The shadow card was Stange Woods for 1 extra attack and the discarded Wall of Trees buffed to 8 attack so Gandalf was killed, raising deck #1's threat to 38 and deck #2's threat to 40.\n\n\n \n\n\nOld Man Willow attacked Defender Of Rammas. The shadow card was Falling Branches for +2 attack and the discarded Deep Gulley added another +2 attack so the Defender of Rammas was killed.\n\n\n \n\n\nAragorn, Beravor, Dunedain Hunter, Guardian of Arnor, Halbarad, Ranger Of The North and Weather Hills Watchman attacked Old Man Willow, inflicting another 8 damage and pushing OMW over the 12 damage threshold. All I need to do now is quest past the last .\n\n\n \n\n\nAt this point in the proceedings I noticed the Old Man Willow's ability adds threat instead of attack so I raised deck #1's threat to 43 and deck #2's threat to 45 at the end of the round to cover for that minor brain-fart.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Six began with deck #1 becoming first player and resources being added before deck #1 drew Steed Of Imladris and deck #2 drew Defender Of Rammas.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning deck #1 exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Idraen before deck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and 2 from Sam to play Sword That Was Broken on Aragorn and paid 2 from Aragorn to play Defender Of Rammas.\n\n\n \n\n\nMoving to questing I committed everyone with willpower (which was more folks thanks to Aragorn's sword-buff), committing Aragorn (with buff), Arwen (adding 1 defence to Halbarad), Beravor, Defender of Rammas (with buff), Dunedain Hunter (with buff), Eleanor, Frodo, Guardian Of Arnor (with buff), Halbarad (with buff), Idraen, Northern Tracker x2 (adding 2 progress to and exploring Withywindle), Ranger Of The North, Sam (with buff), Warden of Healing x2 and Weather Hills Watchman (with buff) before deck #1 drew Ending And Failing, which raised deck #1's threat to 45 and deck #2's to 47, and deck #2 drew Long Trailer. I committed 32 against 5 threat so 4 progress explored Deep Gulley and the other 23 threat blew through stage 3, winning the game.\n\n\n \n\n\nThis was odd. I added a lot of location control cards to deck #1 for this game and none of them got into play. I was lucky with encounter deck draws and this went a lot better than I expected.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the game I had done enough damage to Old Man Willow to add Old Bogey-Stories to the campaign log.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=2130698","commentId":2130698,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1459278655,"content":"LORD OF THE RINGS SAGA CAMPAIGN #3: FOG ON THE BARROW DOWNS (ATTEMPT ONE).\n\n \n\nThanks to a minor error (I didn't save the writeup or copy and paste the right thing) but regardless the Fellowship just managed to win the scenario (although there was a lot of injured heroes and a ridiculous amount of dead allies). the Fellowship gained Ho, Tom Bombadil and continued onto Bree."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=2132753","commentId":2132753,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1459379204,"content":"LORD OF THE RINGS SAGA CAMPAIGN #4: A KNIFE IN THE DARK.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDue to having less time to write-up the quests for a few weeks I'll cut things down to the high (or otherwise) lights.\n\n\n * I barely managed to make it through this.\n   \n * The Fellowship suffered their first loss as Beravor died at Weathertop.\n   \n * Both decks were running at over 45 threat (deck B had used Favor of the Valar to drop threat back to 45 in the last turn).\n   \n * I definitely shouldn't have put three Ringwraiths into the encounter deck since this bit me on the rump at the end of the turn.\n   \n\nAt the end of the game I gave Eleanor the Tireless Ranger card and Sam the Noble Hero card.

This gave me 25 threat and a opening hand containing A Good Harvest, Blood Of Numenor, Gondorian Fire x2, Nenya and Steward of Gondor. With all the ingredients needed to uber-buff Boromir I decided to keep the hand.\n\n\n \n\n\nQuest set-up consisted of making The Leaping Fish the active location, attaching Alcaron's Scroll to Boromir and adding a Harbor Thug to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn One began with adding a resource to each hero before I drew Galadriel's Handmaiden.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning I played Blood Of Numenor and Gondorian Fire on Boromir, then exhausted Galadriel to draw Arwen Undomiel and reduced my threat to 24, then played A Good Harvest and paid 1 from Boromir and Galadriel to play Steward Of Gondor on Boromir and exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir. I ended a busy phase by paying 1 from Glorfindel to play Nenya on Galadriel.\n\n\n \n\n\nMoving onto the quest phase I drew and discarded Pickpocket before committing Boromir and Glorfindel to the quest. I drew Collateral Damage and drew and discarded Harbor Thug and Market Square so had to raise my threat to 26. I committed 6 against 2 threat so 4 progress was added to The Leaping Fish.\n\n\n \n\n\nI engaged the Harbor Thug, who attacked Boromir after I raised my threat to 27 to refresh him. I paid 1 from Boromir to buff his defence by 1 using Gondorian Fire. The shadow card was Umbar Assassin for no effect so the attack did no damage. I raised my threat to 28 to refresh Boromir and used him to attack the Harbor Thug, inflicting 2 damage.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards and raised my threat to 29.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Two began with adding a resource to my heroes before I drew Daeron's Runes. I exhausted Galadriel to lower my threat to 28 and draw Light Of Valinor. I played Daeron's Runes and drew Warden Of Healing and Ancient Mathem before discarding Gondorian Fire. I then exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Boromir and paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Light of Valinor on Glorfindel.\n\n\n \n\n\nI started the Quest phase by drawing and discarding Market Square before I committed Boromir and Glorfindel (without exhausting) before drawing City Streets. I committed 6 against 2 threat so 2 progress explored The Leaping Fish, adding it to the victory display and 2 progress was added to stage 1B.\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter I travelled to City Streets I raised my threat to 29 to ready Boromir and paid 1 from him to use Gondorian Fire to buff his defence by 3 before Harbor Thug attacked him, drawing City Streets for 2 more attack, which Boromir's buff dealt with. Glorfindel attacked and killed the Harbor Thug.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed everything before raising my threat to 30.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Three began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew another Ancient Mathem. I then exhausted Steward to add another 2 resources to Boromir and exhausted Galadriel to draw Asfaloth and lower my threat to 29\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning I paid 2 from Galadriel to play Asfaloth on Glorfindel. I exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to City Streets, exploring it.\n\n\n \n\n\nI committed Boromir and Glorfindel (without exhausting) to the quest before I drew Collateral Damage. I drew Zealous Traitor, Lossarnach Bandit, City Streets and Lurking In Shadows and raising my threat to 31. I committed 6 against 0 threat so 4 progress was added to stage 1B, exploring it. Stage 2 added Alcaron's Scroll to the staging area where I exhausted Glorfindel to add Alcaron's Scroll to him.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed my cards before raising my threat to 32.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Four began with adding resources before I drew Gondorian Shield, exhausted Glorfindel to draw Silver Harp and reduce my threat to 31 and exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Boromir.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning I paid 1 from Boromir to play Gondorian Shield on him and paid 2 from Glorfindel to play Galadriel's Handmaiden, who lowered my threat to 30.\n\n\n \n\n\nI committed Boromir and Glorfindel (without exhausting) before drawing Lost In The City, which forced me to put City Streets into the staging area. I then paid 1 from Boromir to play Gondorian Fire and increase his attack by 7 until the end of the phase. I also exhausted Asfaloth to add 2 progress to City Streets, exploring it. This gave me a total 13 willpower against 0 threat so the 13 progress blew through stage 2B. Stage 3 forced me to add a Harbor Thug to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Harbor Thug engaged me and (after I raised my threat to 31 to ready him) attacked Boromir, drawing Zealous Traitor for no effect. The attack did no damage. After raising my threat to 32 to refresh Boromir, he and Glorfindel attacked and killed the Harbor Thug.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed everything before raising my threat to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Five began with my heroes each gaining a resource before I drew Core Set Gandalf and exhausted Steward to add another 2 resources to Boromir.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring planning I paid 2 from Galadriel to play Arwen Undomiel and paid 4 from Boromir and 1 from Glorfindel to play Gandalf, who lowered my threat to 28.\n\n\n \n\n\nI committed Arwen Undomiel (without exhausting), Boromir, Galadriel's Handmaiden, Gandalf (without exhausting) and Glorfindel (without exhausting) before exhausting Galadriel and Nenya to add her willpower to Glorfindel's.

I decided to build two decks with as much of the Fellowship that I could to play through many quests in the run up to a Saga run.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #1 contains Merry (Spirit), Pippin (Lore) and Sam Gamgee for a low 20 threat and a opening hand containing Errand-Rider, Gandalf (Core), Hobbit Pony, Self-Preservation x2 and Sneak Attack.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 contains Aragorn (Lore), Boromir (Tactics) and Legolas with 32 threat and a opening hand containing Black Arrow, Defender Of Rammas, Dunedain Hunter, Gondorian Shield, Secret Vigil and Skyward Volley.\n\n\n \n\n\nQuest set-up consisted of putting a Suspect and Hideout aside, setting up a Investigation deck, making the Prancing Pony the active location and putting a Ramshackle Manor into the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn One began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Celebrian's Stone and deck #2 drew Gandalf (Core).\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #1's planning consisted of playing Hobbit Pony on Merry and paying 1 from Sam to play Errand-Rider before deck #2 played Black Arrow on Legolas and paid 1 from Boromir to play Gondorian Shield on him before playing Dunedain Hunter (who pulled a Chetwood Outlaw out of the encounter deck and put it into play engaged with deck #2) and paid 1 from Legolas to play Secret Vigil on Chetwood Outlaw.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the start of the quest phase deck #1 raised their threat to 22 before I committed Merry, Pippin and Sam Gamgee and drew Chetwood Outlaw, Bree-Land Informant and another Ramshackle Manor. I committed 7 willpower against 11 threat so deck #1's threat increased to 26 and deck #2's increased to 36.\n\n\n \n\n\nWith the situation taking a turn for the worst deck #2 was forced to engage the Bree-Land Informant before the Chetwood Outlaw attacked Dunedain Hunter. The shadow card was Greenwood Footpad, which added 2 attack and really, really killed the Dunedain Hunter. The Bree-Land Informant made a attack on Boromir. The shadow card was Bill Ferny, who forced deck #2 to take the attack undefended. Boromir took 2 damage before I raised deck #2's threat to 37 to ready him.\n\n\n \n\n\nAragorn, Boromir and Legolas attacked and killed the Chetwood Outlaw, which reduced deck #1's threat to 25 and deck #2s to 36 before adding 2 progress to the Prancing Pony, which explored it and sent it to the victory display. The investigation effect allowed me to draw Johnny Goblin-Fingers and Susie The Spider. Deck #1 ended the phase by exhausting Errand-Rider to move a resource from Merry to Pippin.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed everything then increased deck #1's threat to 26 and deck #2's to 37.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Two began with deck #2 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Athelas and deck #1 drew Faramir.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 paid 3 from Pippin to add Self-Preservation to Boromir before exhausting Errand-Rider to move a resource from Merry to Sam and paid 2 from Sam to play Celebrian's Stone on him. Deck #2 paid 1 each from Boromir and Legolas to play Defender Of Rammas.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the start of the quest phase I raised deck #1's threat to 28 before committing Aragorn, Merry, Pippin and Sam. I drew Old Warehouse, Market Square and another Market Square. I committed 11 willpower against 15 threat so deck #1's threat increased to 41.\n\n\n \n\n\nFaced with a bad selection the Fellowship travelled to Old Warehouse, drawing Village Stable and adding it to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Bree-Land Informant attacked Boromir, drawing Ramshackle Manor for no effect. I opted to pay 1 from Aragorn and raised deck #2's threat to 42 to look at the bottom card of the Investigation deck, Todd The Troll and discard the Bree-Land Informant. Deck #2 then exhausted Self-Preservation to heal 2 damage from Boromir.\n\n\n \n\n\nI ended the turn by rrefreshing everything before I raised deck #1's threat to 33 and deck #2's to 43.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Three began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Errand-Rider and deck #2 drew Grappling Hook.\n\n\n \n\n\nKnowing that even if I committed everyone with any willpower I was still 2 short of the current threat total I opted to quit the game.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=2249935","commentId":2249935,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1464993783,"content":"SAGA RUN: A SHADOW OF THE PAST (ATTEMPT 1).\n\n\n \n\n\nFor this run-through of the LOTR saga I opted to play two-handed.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #1 comprised Beravor, Glorfindel (Spirit) and Idraen with 26 threat and a (post-mulligan) opening hand containing Arwen Undomiel, Elrond's Counsel, Fast Hitch, The Evening Star and The Favour Of The Lady.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 comprised Aragorn (Tactics), Halbarad and Sam Gamgee with 30 threat and a opening hand containing Errand-Rider, Feint, Ranger Summons, Secret Vigil and Steward Of Gondor.\n\n\n \n\n\nSet-up for the quest consisted of adding Frodo Baggins (TBR, with Mr. Underhill and The One Ring) into play attached to deck #1, putting Gandalf's Delay into play, making Bag End the active location and adding a Black Rider to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn One began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Steed Of Imladris and deck #2 drew Weather Hills Watchman.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #1 paid 1 from Glorfindel and Idraen to play Arwen Undomiel and paid 1 from Beravor to play Fast Hitch on Sam Gamgee.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 paid 1 from Halbarad and Sam Gamgee to play Steward Of Gondor on Halbarad before exhausting it to add 2 resources to Halbarad and paying the 2 resources to play Weather Hills Watchman, whose ability put a Dunedain Warning into deck #2's hand.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the quest phase I committed Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence and sentinel to Halbarad), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Glorfindel (raising deck #1's threat to 27), Idraen and Sam Gamgee before deck #1 drew Evil Crow and deck #2 drew Pathless Country. I committed 14 willpower against 8 threat. 3 progress explored Bag End, sending it to the victory display and allowing deck #1 to draw Gandalf (Core) and deck #2 to draw Dunedain Warning before 1 progress explored stage 1B. Stage 2B added another Black Rider to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Fellowship opted to travel to Pathless Country.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 opted to engage the Evil Crow.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Evil Crow made a undefended attack on Halbarad, drawing Mustering For The Ring for no effect. No damage is taken before Aragorn attacks and kills the Evil Crow. Aragorn's ability triggers and forces one of the Black Riders to engage deck #2, which readies and buffs Sam Gamgee. Halbarad, Sam Gamgee and Weather Hills Watchman attack the Black Rider, inflicting 1 damage.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn everything refreshed before deck #1's threat increased to 28 and deck #2's increased to 31.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Two began with deck #2 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Weather Hills Watchman and deck #1 drew The Long Defeat.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 exhausted Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Halbarad before paying 2 from Halbarad to add 2 Dunedain Warnings to Halbarad and paying 1 each from Halbarad and Sam to play Weather Hills Watchman, who pulled another Ranger Summons into deck #2's hand.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #1 paid 1 from Beravor to play The Long Defeat on stage 2B before paying 1 from Glorfindel to play Steed Of Imladris on Idraen.\n\n\n \n\n\nI committed Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence and sentinel to Halbarad), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Glorfindel (raising deck #1's threat to 29), Halbarad (without exhausting), Idraen (exhausting Steed Of Imladris and discarding The Evening Star to add 2 progress to Pathless Country) and Sam Gamgee. Deck #2 drew Have You Seen Baggins?, which I immediately paid 1 from Frodo and exhausted The One Ring to reshuffle into the encounter deck. Deck #2 drew Green Hill Country and deck #1 drew Gildor Inglorion, which was attached to deck #2. I committed 16 willpower against 6 threat so 1 progress explored Pathless Country and 9 progress was added to stage 2B.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Fellowship travelled to Green Hill Country.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Black Rider attacked Halbarad, drawing Green Hill Country for +1 attack and inflicting 1 damage. After exhausting Fast Hitch to refresh Sam Gamgee Aragorn, Gildor Inglorion, Sam Gamgee and both Weather Hills Watchmen attacked and killed the Black Rider. Aragorn's ability triggered and forced the remaining Black Rider to engage deck #2, which refreshed and buffed Sam Gamgee, who unfortunately could do nothing.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed everything and raised deck #1's threat to 30 and deck #2's to 32 before discarding Gildor Inglorion.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Three began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Miner Of The Iron Hills and deck #2 drew Galadriel.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #1 paid 1 from Glorfindel and Idraen to play Favour Of The Lady on Glorfindel.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 exhausted Steward to add 2 resources to Halbarad before paying 3 from Halbarad to play Galadriel, who attached Sword That Was Broken to Aragorn, who then paid 2 to play 2 copies of Ranger Summons and shuffled 2 Rangers Of The North into the encounter deck.\n\n\n \n\n\nI committed Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence and sentinel on Halbarad), Beravor, Frodo Baggins, Galadriel (with Sword buff), Glorfindel (raising deck #1's threat to 31), Halbarad (without exhausting and with Sword buff), Idraen and Sam Gamgee (with Sword buff). Deck #1 drew Stock Road and deck #2 drew Lure Of The Ring, which forced deck #1 to exhaust the One Ring before deck #2 drew another Stock Road. Deck #1 played Elrond's Counsel on Idraen to add 1 willpower and reduce deck #1's threat to 28. I committed 22 willpower versus 6 threat so 3 progress explored Green Hill Country and 13 progress was added to stage 2B, exploring it. The Long Defeat triggered, allowing deck #1 to draw Light Of Valinor on The Riddermark's Finest and deck #2 to draw Dagger Of Westernesse and Honour Guard. Stage 3 added the Buckleberry Ferry and another Black Rider to the staging area.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 paid 1 from Aragorn to Feint the Black Rider's attack before attacking it with Aragorn, Halbarad, Sam Gamgee and Weather Hills Watchman x2, inflicting 5 damage.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the turn I refreshed everything, discarded Galadriel and raised deck #1's threat to 29 and deck #2's threat to 33.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Four began with deck #2 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #2 drew Dunedain Hunter and deck #1 drew Evening Star.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 exhausted the Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to Halbarad, then paid 1 from Aragorn to play Dagger Of Westernesse on him and paid 1 from Halbarad to play Errand-Rider.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #1 paid 1 each from Glorfindel and Idraen to play The Riddermark's Finest and paid 2 from Beravor to play The Evening Star, adding 2 progress to each of the Stock Roads in the staging area, then exhausted and discarded The Riddermark's Finest to add 2 progress to one of the Stock Roads, exploring it before paying 1 from Glorfindel to play Light Of Valinor on him.\n\n\n \n\n\nI committed Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence and sentinel to Halbarad), Beravor, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Halbarad (without exhausting and with Sword buff), Idraen (discarding Miner Of The Iron Hills to add 1 progress to Pathless County with Steed of Imladris, exploring it and refreshing Idraen) and Sam Gamgee (with Sword buff). Deck #2 drew Evil Crow and deck #1 drew Ranger Of The North, which was attached to deck #2 and added 2 damage to the Black Rider in the staging area. I committed 14 willpower against 8 threat so successfully quested.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 committed Frodo and the Ranger Of The North before taking a Hide 3 test, drawing 2x Have You Seen Baggins and Ride Like A Gale, passing the test so that the Fellowship could travel to Buckleberry Ferry.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 engaged the Evil Crow.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Black Rider attacked Halbarad, drawing Black Steed for no effect so the attack did no damage. The Evil Crow made a undefended attack on Aragorn, drawing Hunting For The Ring for no effect so the attack did no damage. Aragorn and one of the Weather Hills Watchmen killed the Black Rider and used Aragorn's ability to engage the other Black Rider (which refreshed and buffed Sam Gamgee). Sam proceeded to kill the Evil Crow.\n\n\n \n\n\nI ended the turn by refreshing everything before raising deck #1's threat to 30 and deck #2's threat to 34.\n\n\n \n\n\nTurn Five began with deck #1 becoming first player and each hero gaining a resource before deck #1 drew Henamarth Riversong and deck #2 drew Errand-Rider.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #1 paid 1 each from Beravor, Glorfindel and Idraen and 2 from Frodo to play Gandalf, which added 4 damage to the last remaining Black Rider, killing it.\n\n\n \n\n\nDeck #2 paid 1 from Boromir to play Errand-Rider.\n\n\n \n\n\nI committed Aragorn (with Sword buff), Arwen Undomiel (adding 1 defence and sentinel to Halbarad), Beravor, Errand-Rider x2 (with Sword buff), Frodo Baggins, Gandalf, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Halbarad (with Sword buff), Idraen, Ranger Of The North (with Sword buff), Sam Gamgee (with Sword buff) and Weather Hills Watchman x2(with Sword buff). Deck #1 drew Black Steed, which surged to Pathless Country before deck #2 drew Woody End. With 3 threat in the staging area I committed a somewhat impressive 34 willpower so 31 progress was added to Buckleberry Ferry, exploring it and winning the game.\n\n\n \n\n\nLoading deck #1 with more than the average number of anti-location cards seemed to work since I think the average length of this quest has been 10+ turns.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt the end of the quest I opted to add The Ring Draws Them and Mr. Underhill to the quest log."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=2252431","commentId":2252431,"userName":"silverthorn","timestamp":1465143778,"content":"SAGA RUN: THE OLD FOREST (ATTEMPT 1).\n\n\n \n\n\nDECK #1.\n\n\nHeroes: Beravor, Glorfindel (Spirit) and Idraen.\n\n\nStarting Threat: 26.\n\n\nStarting Hand: A Test Of Will, Asfaloth, Gather Information.

adding a resource to each of my heroes before I drew Gandalf (Core).\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter exhausting Steward to add 2 resources to Gimli I paid 3 from Aragorn and 2 from Legolas to play Gandalf, then used his ability to draw Mirkwood Long-Knife, Warden of Healing and Galadriel.

These runs will be solo and I will probably change the hero line up as I go for specific quests.\n\n \n\nMy heroes were Aragorn (Lore), Frodo Baggins and Glorfindel (Spirit), with 24 threat and a opening hand (after a mulligan) containing Ethir Swordsman, Hasty Stroke, Miner of the Iron Hills, Sam Gamgee, Song of Travel and The Galadhrim's Greeting.\n\n \n\nSet up for the quest comprised making The Leaping Fish the active location, attaching Alcaron's Scroll to Frodo and adding a Harbour Thug to the staging area before I shuffled the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nTurn One began with adding a resource to each of my heroes before I drew Warden of Healing.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 1 from Frodo and Glorfindel to play Ethir Swordsman.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I discarded Collateral Damage, then committed Ethir Swordsman.\n\n \n\nI drew another Collateral Damage and discarded City Streets (increasing my threat to 26 and forcing me to engage the Harbour Thug), Harbour Thug, Harbour Storehouse (increasing my threat to 28) and Umbar Assassin.\n\n \n\nI committed 1 attack vs 0 threat so added 1 progress to The Leaping Fish.\n\n \n\nIn the combat phase I added a shadow card before the Harbour Thug attacked Frodo (shadow card: Harbour Thug, for no effect), increasing my threat to 29 before Aragorn and Glorfindel killed the Harbour Thug.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 30.\n\n \n\nRound Two began with adding resources before I drew Miner of the Iron Hills.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 1 from Glorfindel to play Sam Gamgee and paid 2 from Aragorn to play Warden of Healing.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I drew and discarded Pelargir Docks before committing Ethir Swordsman, Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee.\n\n \n\nI drew Pickpocket, adding it to the staging area.\n\n \n\nI committed 3 attack vs 3 threat so made no progress.\n\n \n\nI was forced to engage the Pickpocket.\n\n \n\nAfter adding a shadow card the Pickpocket made a undefended attack on Frodo (removing a resource from Frodo and discarding Song of Travel). The shadow card was Harbour Thug, for no real effect so the attack raised my threat to 31 before Aragorn and Glorfindel killed the Pickpocket.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 32.\n\n \n\nRound Three began with adding resources before I drew Light of Valinor.\n\n \n\nI paid 1 from Gllorfindel to play Light of Valinor on himself.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I discarded City Streets, then committed Ethir Swordsman, Frodo Baggins, Glorfindel (without exhausting) and Sam Gamgee.\n\n \n\nI drew Local Trouble and attached it to Aragorn.\n\n \n\nI committed 6 attack vs 0 threat so added 5 progress to The Leaping Fish, exploring it (total VP: 3), and added 1 progress to stage 1B.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refreshed everything and increased my threat to 33.\n\n \n\nRound Four began with adding resources before I drew Warden of Healing.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 2 from Aragorn to play Miner of the Iron Hills (discarding the Local Trouble on Aragorn).\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Aragorn, Ethir Swordsman, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Miner of the Iron Hills and Sam Gamgee.\n\n \n\nI drew City Streets, which was added to the staging area and surged to another Collateral Damage. I discarded Pickpocket, Harbour Thug, Zealous Traitor, Lost In The City, Local Trouble and Market Square (increasing my threat to 35).\n\n \n\nI committed 9 attack against 2 threat so added 5 progress to stage 1B, exploring it. Stage 2 moved Alcaron's Scroll to the staging area.\n\n \n\nI was forced to move to the City Streets.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refreshed my cards before increasing my threat to 36.\n\n \n\nRound Five began with adding resources before I drew Wingfoot.\n\n \n\nIn the planning phase I paid 1 from Aragorn to play Wingfoot on himself.\n\n \n\nIn the quest phase I committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Ethir Swordsman, Frodo, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Miner of the Iron Hills and Sam Gamgee.\n\n \n\nI drew Pelargir Docks, adding it to the staging area.\n\n \n\nI committed 10 attack vs 4 threat so added 2 progress to City Streets, exploring it, and added 4 progress to stage 2B.\n\n \n\nI opted to risk travelling to Pelargir Docks.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 37 before risking triggering Aragorn's ability to lower my threat to 24.\n\n \n\nRound Six began with adding resources before I drew Henamarth Riversong.\n\n \n\nI paid 1 from Aragorn to play Henamarth Riversong, then exhausted him to look at the top card of the encounter deck, then return it.\n\n \n\nI committed Aragorn (naming Treachery for Wingfoot), Ethir Swordsman, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Miner of the Iron Hills and Sam, then drew Collateral Damage (refreshing Aragorn and discarding Lurking In Shadows, Lossarnach Bandit, Zealous Traitor, another Zealous Traitor, another Lossarnach Bandit, Lurking In Shadows, Market Square (increasing my threat to 26) and Pickpocket) so I committed 9 attack vs 0 threat so added 3 progress to Pelargir Docks (exploring it) and added 6 progress to stage 2B before exhausting Frodo to attach Alcaron's Scroll to him.\n\n \n\nI ended the round by refreshing my cards and increasing my threat to 27.\n\n \n\nRound Seven began with adding resources before I drew Northern Tracker.\n\n \n\nI paid 2 each from Frodo and Glorfindel to play Northern Tracker, then exhausted Henamarth to look at the top card of the encounter deck, then return it.\n\n \n\nI committed Ethir Swordsman, Miner of the Iron Hills and Northern Tracker, then drew Harbour Storehouse (which was added to the staging area). I committed 4 attack vs 1 threat so added 3 progress to stage 2B, exploring it. Stage 3 forced me to shuffle the encounter discard pile into a new encounter deck, pull a Harbour Thug into the staging area and shuffle the encounter deck again.\n\n \n\nI opted not to travel.\n\n \n\nI engaged the Harbour Thug.\n\n \n\nAfter adding a shadow card the Harbour Thug attacked Frodo (shadow card: Pelargir Docks, for no effect) increasing my threat to 28 before Aragorn and Glorfindel killed the Harbour Thug.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the round I refreshed my cards and increased my threat to 29.\n\n \n\nRound Nine began with each hero gaining a resource before I drew Gandalf (Core).\n\n \n\nI paid 1 from Aragorn and Glorfindel and 3 from Frodo to play Gandalf, who reduced my threat to 24.\n\n \n\nI committed Aragorn (naming Enemy for Wingfoot), Ethir Swordsman, Frodo Baggins, Gandalf, Glorfindel (without exhausting), Henamarth Riversong, Northern Tracker (adding 1 progress to the Harbour Storehouse), Sam Gamgee and Warden of Healing, then drew Local Trouble, attaching it to Aragorn. I committed 17 willpower against 1 threat so added 16 progress to stage 3B, exploring it and winning the quest.\n\n \n\nThis was a slog. Granted, this deck can suffer in Battle Quests but it went pretty well.\n\n \n\nIn the end my score was:\n\n \n\nCompleted Rounds (7): 70\n\nTotal Threat: 24.\n\nTotal VP: 3.\n\nFinal Score: 91."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/?do=findComment&comment=3448980","commentId":3448980,"userName":"gmcc","timestamp":1534974083,"content":"I dont know how the game work or what missions are but seeing ur posts was entertaining.

This finished stage 1B and advanced to stage 2A (which searched Narrow Fissure, Stairs of Nain, Great Cave-Troll, Spider Broodling and another Spider Broodling, added a Spider Broodling to the staging area and shuffled the rest back into the encounter deck).
