However, it's often a good idea to attach multiple copies of Caught in a Web to the same hero. Although it becomes prohibitively difficult to ready that single character, it's frequently better than having TWO heroes ensnared at the same time (and being forced to pay for both). "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68602-two-caught-in-a-web/?do=findComment&comment=669055","commentId":669055,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1344202522,"content":"Please check out the official FAQ, which you can downloaded at the Support page of this game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68602-two-caught-in-a-web/?do=findComment&comment=669873","commentId":669873,"userName":"Gaffophone","timestamp":1344324356,"content":"Quoting the FAQ is a bit more constructive, don't you think ?\n\nQ: How does a player resolve the situation in which a single hero has multiple copies of Caught in a Web (CORE 80) attached?\nA: The player must pay for each copy of Caught in a Web before the hero can ready.
