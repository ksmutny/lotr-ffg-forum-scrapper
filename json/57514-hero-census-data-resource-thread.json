For the purpose of creating various theme decks, I thought it would be fun to have a consolidated organized listing of heroes by various traits. Please feel free to help me out with this project if I’ve gotten confused about any of the data or if you have more ideas for groupings or thematic combos. And as long as there’s interest, I can keep this post updated as we receive more heroes over time.\n\nGender\n\nMale: Aragorn, Bilbo Baggins, Boromir, Brand son of Bain, Dáin Ironfoot, Dúnhere, Denethor, Frodo Baggins, Gimli, Glóin, Glorfindel, Legolas, Prince Imrahil, Théodred, Thalin\n\nFemale: Beravor, Éowyn, Eleanor\n\nRace\n\nDwarf: Dáin Ironfoot, Gimli, Glóin, Thalin\n\nElf: Glorfindel, Legolas\n\nHobbit: Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins\n\nMen: Aragorn, Beravor, Boromir, Brand son of Bain, Denethor, Dúnhere, Eleanor, Éowyn, Prince Imrahil, Théodred\n\nKey Words\n\nDale: Brand son of Bain\n\nDúnedain: Aragorn, Beravor\n\nDwarf: Dáin Ironfoot, Gimli, Glóin, Thalin\n\nGondor: Boromir, Denethor, Eleanor, Prince Imrahil\n\nNoble: Aragorn, Boromir, Denethor, Eleanor, Éowyn, Gimli, Glóin, Glorfindel, Legolas, Prince Imrahil, Théodred\n\nNoldor: Glorfindel\n\nRanger: Aragorn, Beravor\n\nRohan: Dúnhere, Éowyn, Théodred\n\nSilvan: Legolas\n\nSteward: Denethor\n\nWarrior: Boromir, Dúnhere, Gimli, Glorfindel, Legolas, Thalin, Théodred\n\nSphere of Influence\n\nLeadership: Aragorn, Dain Ironfoot, Glóin, Prince Imrahil, Théodred\n\nLore: Bilbo Baggins, Beravor, Denethor, Glorfindel\n\nSpirit: Eleanor, Éowyn, Dúnhere, Frodo Baggins\n\nTactics: Boromir, Brand son of Bain, Gimli, Legolas, Thalin\n\nCard Stats\n\nThreat Cost:\n\n12 – Aragorn, Glorfindel\n11 – Boromir, Dain Ironfoot, Gimli, Prince Imrahil\n10 – Beravor, Brand son of Bain\n9 – Bilbo Baggins, Éowyn, Glóin, Legolas, Thalin\n8 – Denethor, Dúnhere, Théodred\n7 – Eleanor, Frodo Baggins\n\nWillpower Strength:\n\n4 – Éowyn\n3 – Glorfindel\n2 – Aragorn, Beravor, Brand son of Bain, Frodo Baggins, Gimli, Glóin, Prince Imrahil\n1 – Boromir, Bilbo Baggins, Dain Ironfoot, Denethor, Dúnhere, Eleanor, Legolas, Thalin, Théodred\n\nAttack Strength:\n\n3 – Aragorn, Boromir, Glorfindel, Legolas, Prince Imrahil\n2 – Beravor, Brand son of Bain, Dain Ironfoot, Gimli, Glóin, Dúnhere, Thalin, Théodred\n1 – Bilbo Baggins, Denethor, Eleanor, Éowyn, Frodo Baggins\n\nDefense Strength:\n\n3 – Dain Ironfoot, Denethor\n2 – Aragorn, Beravor, Bilbo Baggins, Boromir, Brand son of Bain, Eleanor, Frodo Baggins, Gimli, Prince Imrahil, Thalin\n1 – Dúnhere, Éowyn, Glóin, Glorfindel, Legolas, Théodred\n\nHit Points:\n\n5 – Aragorn, Boromir, Dain Ironfoot, Gimli, Glorfindel\n4 – Beravor, Dúnhere, Legolas, Glóin, Prince Imrahil, Thalin, Théodred\n3 – Brand son of Bain, Denethor, Eleanor, Éowyn\n2 – Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins\n\nGame Text\n\nComing Soon…\n\nSet Information\n\nComing Soon…\n\nThematic Hero Combinations\n\nThe Three Hunters (Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57514-hero-census-data-resource-thread/?do=findComment&comment=567030","commentId":567030,"userName":"Thorongil","timestamp":1323764486,"content":" You could also group by sphere, threat cost, willpower, attack strength, defense strength, and hit points.

I'll work on these soon and add them to the post. I'll probably organize these categories under the two larger headings of Stats and Abilities, or something like that. Good stuff!\n\nAlso, I was thinking it might be fun to add a section of fun hero combo theme ideas (e.g. the 3 Hunters - Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli). It would be fun to hear what other thematic combos people have run with their decks and list them all in one place."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57514-hero-census-data-resource-thread/?do=findComment&comment=567341","commentId":567341,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1323823843,"content":"Okay... Sphere of Influence and Card Stats sections complete.\n\nWill work on Game Text and Set Information sections soon.\n\nIn the mean time, feel free to post any ideas for Thematic Hero Combinations (as somehow tied to the story)."}]}
