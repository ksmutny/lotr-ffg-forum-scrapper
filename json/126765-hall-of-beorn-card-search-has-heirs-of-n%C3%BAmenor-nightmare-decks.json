From a solo perspective, Cair Andros was one of easiest quests in the game, it really needed a harder version.

I'm not quite sure how its going to be that much harder when you can still quest for 15 on first turn and even more every round with guys like Beregond, thalin, rammas, winged guardian ect.\n\nEdited November 14, 2014 by Khamul The Easterling"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126765-hall-of-beorn-card-search-has-heirs-of-n%C3%BAmenor-nightmare-decks/?do=findComment&comment=1334188","commentId":1334188,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1415966547,"content":"They should not hate on Ramnas IMO, but Eagle hate would have been cool.

These battle/siege quests force us to expend our attacking/defending forces on questing, limiting our combat options if we want to succeed and also render the willpower useless.\n\n \n\nSo, what if these quest keywords, aside from changing willpower into something else, had some additional effects upon successful questing? Like, for example: \n\nIf players successfully quest on a battle quest, then each player may assign 2 damage to an engaged enemy (or each enemy gets -2 defense, or each charageter gets +1 attack). \n\nFor siege could be something like \"each player may choose an engaged enemy. that enemy does not attacks this combat phase.\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126765-hall-of-beorn-card-search-has-heirs-of-n%C3%BAmenor-nightmare-decks/?do=findComment&comment=1334228","commentId":1334228,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1415969552,"content":"Very cool idea.
