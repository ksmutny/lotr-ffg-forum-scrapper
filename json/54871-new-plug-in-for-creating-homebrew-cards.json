You can download it at http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html [http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html] or at Svenn’s page at http://tabletopgeeks.com/living-card-game-resources/ [http://tabletopgeeks.com/living-card-game-resources/] (look for LotR Encounter Pack plug-in), who kindly offered to host it, too! As the pool of fan-made adventures is and hopefully will be growing, this plug-in could be a nice tool for card creators.\n\nIn the new version it's not only possible to create custom encounter cards, but you can also make homebrew player cards with it! This is possible due to GeckoTH’s high quality templates. Many thanks to him! Also thx to Rhuarc, who notified me about Gecko’s work in the first place ;-) And also to Svenn, for providing a better download option than 4shared!\n\nTo install it, first download Strange Eons for free here: http://cgjennings.ca/eons/#Download [http://cgjennings.ca/eons/#Download]\nThen, double-click the LotR.seext file, and then it gets installed (or updated). Restart Strange Eons. Afterwards, select a card you want to create, e.g. an ally card:\nCreate an ally [http://api.ning.com/files/emG38eNymeFVmBMCjSqEKP5QQENEiqdATa9l03tiIQ3PDNTA7LuzalK-49WT*8h8*v-on1KHkAWaXxnDwYB7fstb6*tpGMvF/Lotr_CreateCard.jpg]\nThen, a new ally card will be created. Jump to the “Ally” tab to experiment with its properties, and change e.g. its sphere from Leadership to Tactics:\nChange its properties [http://api.ning.com/files/oTlWvhTWsv9ESW3tmbTALZC0EoRxb-e97KQ8LbX9HZH6zIjEL30Jwx2PE42WO2iOHcmxDn4RvqJsD0KnAnWAAU3aEk-gGQWQ/Lotr_ModifyAlly.jpg]\nOr change its card text. Don’t miss the resource icons new in this version, accessible via the <rta>, <rsp>, <rlo> and <rle> replacement tags. You can see all possible tags in the lower left of the upper picture.\nTo insert your own card image, go to the “Portrait” tab and select an image to load.\n\nTo create a pack of cards with several copies of a card, first create all of cards (only single instances) and save them via File -> Save As. Then, create a card deck in SE:\n\nCreate deck of cards [http://api.ning.com/files/wlsmDVS52Dx5pIzhjLiTX*aQLKO2VUmlJTVrtoiLDtkp5*5HjT5N2kzGcMSaqC18KBuxkdSyZbgAVduad4FQF7Ev3xgRX*Nw/LotR_CreateDeckOfCards.jpg]\nThen, read and delete the yellow instruction plate, and click on Components - Add Cards to load your cards:\nAdd saved cards [http://api.ning.com/files/oTlWvhTWsv8se1CfAoPMYq4meylKLlerNeGwS7LuOsQpmm1lrAcmjmeJEt44z5Lt8jiVJ2FQ5Q3glJp7UOEzWup6a5msmJY7/Lotr_AddCardsToDeck.jpg]\nDrag as many copies of the cards you want to the sheet:\nDrag cards to deck of cards [http://api.ning.com/files/Q7RRZtxQWvPiiDuZQOsbYXuVfwRfYETv2SLQ9igaH7uxgXEH1dBJsLjo5Z1HwIpcEj6LuMZ8mk8N95fX2z9pcdG5Inc-RRSh/LotR_DeckOfCardsFinished.jpg]\nThen, save, print, or export to PDF or image files your homebrew cards!\n\nIf you’re wondering whether you should use this plug-in or Gecko’s templates, here a list of what my plug-in can do:\n\n * The plug-in provides a quick and easy way for creating homebrew cards, without GIMP or Photoshop or similar programs.\n * You can easily create decks with multiple copies of a created card.\n * If you need any changes/errata in card text etc., it can be done very fast, just change the card file, save it, reload your deck file again, and then every copy automatically has the new card text.\n\nBut of course there are some restrictions/limitations:\n\n * There are no scans of portraits/texts of cards FFG published. The plug-in is designed for creating custom cards by fans and for fans; you aren’t able to copy the game with it. Next to that, any commercial use of the plug-in is prohibited, of course.\n * The region for e.g. the Artist’s name is fixed; you can’t change it or other regions on a card-by-card basis.\n * The plug-in doesn’t support color gradients for fonts.\n * You can’t re-arrange the general outfit of the card or add other fancy stuff for which I didn’t provide an option (e.g. two-sphered heroes).\n\nIf any of the latter 3 points are of importance for you, you’re better of creating your homebrew cards with Gecko’s templates directly. (Or perhaps you can use my plug-in for quickly testing game balance etc., and when you’re satisfied with the textual content, you can use Gecko’s templates to create the final version of the cards.) His templates can be found on BGG, e.g. here: www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/70314/hero-card-template-300dpi-psd [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/70314/hero-card-template-300dpi-psd]. But if you’re looking for an easy and fast way to have your ideas for card creation realized, my plug-in could be of use for you.\n\nSupported languages are English and German at the moment. Other languages are generally possible, if someone is willing to do the translation.\n\nSo then, happy card-creating!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=543609","commentId":543609,"userName":"NinjaDorg","timestamp":1318920178,"content":" Epic beyond belief!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=543622","commentId":543622,"userName":"A Paperback Hero","timestamp":1318921870,"content":"Nice work guys!

You can try elfwood.com [http://www.elfwood.com] and deviantart.com [http://www.deviantart.com]. There are some awesome pics. But it could be difficult to use the pictures. (All rights are reserved usually, so you got to ask for permission first. At elfwood chances could be better, but on deviantart there are also many artists who provided scans of their commissions, so I think they can't allow you to use them.) You can search on flickr.com for paintings only with creative commons license (use the advanced search). And you can search on wikimedia commons http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings].

Allso the information is a little slim. Only the name and difficulty at this moment. But even now this is very usefull! I am just being afraid that arter more scenarios are released, it may become more and more difficult to find what you are looking for.\n\nThe summary in the top of the page is the most important part of this portall! It should give some information: difficulty and average rating and quick link to the host page (where the files and additional information can be found) Maybe nothing more, so that the \"Link\"-list woud remain easy to read. So actually it is guite good as it is now, The only \"killer\" feature missing is the link to the host page. And because the scenario list is an picture at this moment, it can not be easily added. So normal list with a link would be easier to do, byt then the rankin system would be difficult to maintain...

Any other rules that are not normal (many scenarios provide scaling rules) And story line introduction is allways nice to have! It adds so much flavor to the scenario!\n\nThe most easy thing would be if people start using Quest sheet template along their custom scenarios!\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/71627/quest-sheet-template-300dpi-psd [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/71627/quest-sheet-template-300dpi-psd]\n\nYou would just have to store the the Quest sheet that contains all scenario information and pdf that contains the nesessary cards.

When I created the plug-in, I had to create a new card type for the enemy cards, for the location cards, for the quest cards and so on... You'll need to do the same for your new card type. You'll need some pogramming capability (JavaScript), a template picture file, and some basic knowledge of SE and its interface to plug-ins. You can start by taking my LotR plug-in and only adding a new card type, that'd be easier than creating all new from scratch. SE is documented well in general, there are examples on how to create a new card type / extension and so on e.g. here [http://cgjennings.ca/eons/tutorial/extensions.html] and here [http://cgjennings.ca/eons/tutorial/diy.html].\n\nI don't know how many cards you plan to create, but as a rule of thumb, you'll only profit from creating your own card type if you plan on creating a lot of cards of that type. Don't try to create a new card type for SE if you only want to make 4 cards or something, you're better off just designing them in Photoshop or Gimp...\n\nIf you have any questions, or need some help / info about plug-ins in SE, don't hesitate to ask me!\n\nGreetings,\n\nPete"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=604513","commentId":604513,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1331482557,"content":"Hannibal_pjv said:\n\nThanks!

It is just too much work to create or maintain the lists in at least 3 languages… Shiv@n is working on some French dividers, though! Second, you'll notice that when you change the divider type from the default (Encounter) to something else (e.g. Lore), the title texts are changed; but when you go back (to Encounter again), it doesn't change back. This is because I wanted to save the user from typing \"Lore\", when he already has selected the Lore divider; but at the same time, I only want to overwrite the title if it is the very first default title of the encounter divider.\n\nYou can download it from 4shared here: http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html [http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=635112","commentId":635112,"userName":"Shiv@n","timestamp":1337784114,"content":"Good job HilariousPete ;-)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=636270","commentId":636270,"userName":"Nyarlazorbec","timestamp":1338017175,"content":"Hello,\n\nGood job, but could it be possible to upload it where a registration is not required, please ?\n\nCheers !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=636287","commentId":636287,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1338021400,"content":"mediafire is a great free host for unlimited storage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=636950","commentId":636950,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1338214791,"content":"Here it is: http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?vdz783xh0gq1j7r [http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?vdz783xh0gq1j7r]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=637672","commentId":637672,"userName":"Nyarlazorbec","timestamp":1338349459,"content":"Thanks, a lot ! cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]\n\nCheers !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=666314","commentId":666314,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1343711728,"content":"Many thanks to HilariousPete for providing us with such a magnifient tool!\n\nI am using the plug-in on my Mac and have a problem: The bold and italic text commands (html) are not working on the card text, alignment and size do work though.

With the transition to SE v 3, I also want to change the distribution of the plug-in (so it can be automatically downloaded through the SE catalogue browser). This will probably be the biggest change for users of my plug-in.\n\nI didn't have the chance to download the AH game extension for SE v 3 (very lame internet here), so I can't say anything definite. But Chris Jennings has been doing an excellent job with SE and I suppose the next version will also be very good and have some improvements.

There is a reason for this. After I finished my studies, I got a job and I'm working into the subject, which takes some time. This time is desperately missing for the plug-in, I haven't been working on it for at least two months. Since I want to concentrate on my job, and my interest in LotR is dwindling (one of the major point is that it is too much battle-focused when compared to e.g. MECCG for my taste - although the majority of people seems to really like that), I decided to give the plug-in in someone elses' hands, hopefully more motivated ones ;-)\n\nI won't prescribe my potential successor what to do with the project - it will be his, then - but the next step's I'd do are inclusion of the encounter set symbols for HoN, soon also for the Hobbit 2, and the migration to SE 3.\n\nChris Jennings has been doing a pretty good job in writing SE and it is usually well documented, although there will be a lot of documents to work into at first. Of course I'm going to support my successor as good as I can. Such a person should be pretty familiar with at least 1 programming language (it is java / javascript, but that's not so important, I'm not a java programmer myself).
