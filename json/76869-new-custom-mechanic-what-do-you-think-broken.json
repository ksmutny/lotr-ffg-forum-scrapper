I think all this really does is allow you to continue to generate resources and put hero exclusive attachments on the character, but that resource generation is usually what kills you when you lose a hero.\n\n \n\nInterestingly enough, gandalf would be a really bad hero… he either leaves play at the end of the round, creates hella threat, and only generates neutral coin."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76869-new-custom-mechanic-what-do-you-think-broken/?do=findComment&comment=743966","commentId":743966,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1357563724,"content":"Yeah, cool idea, though I agree with the limit 1 per deck suggestions just to help prevent degenerate combos with Hero only attachments that weren't ever supposed to be able to attach to certain allies. Could lead to some broken combination at some point. Even right away I imagine stuff like Unexpected Courages on Faramir being crazy good.\n\nCould lead to funny circumstances where you lose all 3 heroes but aren't knocked out of the game, but at least the hit to your final score would be equally as funny.\n\nDoesn't cost 5 seem kinda high though? I mean, if I was going to pay 5 for something like this I might as well just pay for Fortune or Fate unless I was doing some kind of combo like I mentioned above. Though maybe cost 5 is good to help make it harder for people to use both this and Fortune or Fate/Landroval to end up with 4 heroes easily."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76869-new-custom-mechanic-what-do-you-think-broken/?do=findComment&comment=744175","commentId":744175,"userName":"BoundForGlory","timestamp":1357587989,"content":"I like it!\n\nYou could also make a cheaper/free option for specific heroes.  Such as, \"If Boromir is in your discard pile and you have less than 3 heroes, make your Faramir ally a hero.\"  Same for a Sam ally (if there ever is one) replacing your Frodo hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76869-new-custom-mechanic-what-do-you-think-broken/?do=findComment&comment=744352","commentId":744352,"userName":"rexhaha","timestamp":1357622123,"content":"Captain Poe said:\n\nWe all know how hard this game can be… what would you guys think of a card like this?\n\n \n\nSphere: Neutral\n\nCost: 5 resources\n\nType: Attachment\n\nName: Heroe's Cause\n\nWhen attached hero is defeated, move this attachment to a unique ally.
