I think the problem with the DG setup is that first you have 3 cards out, not many others bring out that many barring surges, not in 2-player/deck generally. Add in that King Spider exhausting heroes, then losing another hero to the quest card (though after the staging draw for the first turn, safe to say didn't make any difference who got captured) and throw in 1B's \"one ally per turn\", not just per deck/player, but as a whole being able to play just one ally, you're not able to withstand all those enemies.\n\nWhereas if you have time to prepare and no pressure to advance, having 4-5 big hitters at the end still makes for a joke of a difficulty 7 quest. Yes, I'm talking about Carrock, even when I drew a Hill Troll while battling the four other Trolls, never felt like I would lose. Compare with say Anduin where that initial HT can break your game turn one (Sneak Attack Gandalf for damage and then defend against the Troll, only for it to get Pursued by Shadow as Shadow effect and Gandy was your only exhausted ally...)."}]}
