In solo encounter deck cannot show real power. RTM is impossible solo! You need at least 2 players same as Dol-Guldor NMode. Even if you win mostly is just luck…….

As Glaurung and others have mentioned, the game changes completely when you play with multiple players. Many quests can seem one dimensional and boring when you reveal a single encounter card each round. These same scenarios become something else entirely when the encounter deck has a chance to chain multiple encounter cards together in the same round.\n\n \n\nAs far as difficulty is concerned, the harder scenarios really require a specific deck build. Those who try to bring a one-size-fits-all deck into these type of quests, especially the Nightmare packs, are going to most-likely be disappointed. I also really enjoy the Nightmare quests. Not only do they bring added difficulty to older scenarios that have become too easy in a larger card pool, but they often tighten up the theme and mechanics to smooth the rough edges. I really can't wait for Nightmare Battle of Five Armies as this is thematically one of my favorite quests. I look forward to seeing how they tweak this quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106284-announcement-for-fall-2014-game-night-kits/?do=findComment&comment=1086060","commentId":1086060,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1400173491,"content":"Wow, and i haven't still won the nmare treasures!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106284-announcement-for-fall-2014-game-night-kits/?do=findComment&comment=1086390","commentId":1086390,"userName":"7theye","timestamp":1400188866,"content":"How do you get these?
