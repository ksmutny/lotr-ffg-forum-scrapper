I've kept up with purchasing the Adventure Packs but have only played the first two questions from the Core Set. While browsing the FAQ, I noticed Eleanor has been errata'd. I'm obviously missing something, but I don't see what the errata is changing. What exactly is this ruling supposed to be clearing up? Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66513-eleanor/?do=findComment&comment=649183","commentId":649183,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1340600593,"content":"I think the deal was that first they decleared that encounter cards are only \"revealed\" meaning the \"when revealed\" trigger when a form of word \"reveal\" is used. Eleanor's text doesn't use such a form and going by the rules then the next card which replaces the initial one should not be \"revealed.\"\n\nI for one think this would add quite a bit to the character which I otherwise have a hard time including. But the designers thought it over-powered and cleared the issue in the next FAQ (I have to say I was the one sending the letter asking for clarification, perhaps among others). On the other hand, the consenus is that Spirit already has the upper hand among the spheres and this would have only broaden the issue."}]}
