Had a lot of fun, even though the quest finished a little anticlimactic as Sauron seemed to run out of enemies. Anyway, going to replay it tomorrow with a self build deck and check out hard mode.\n\nI am just a little sad quite some heroes they showed during their streams aren't currently available in an way (yeah I know they will show up eventually)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281707-the-journey-begins-early-access-is-a-go/?do=findComment&comment=3454146","commentId":3454146,"userName":"DailyRich","timestamp":1535502699,"content":"How exactly do you get the early access?  Do you have to purchase one of the packs?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281707-the-journey-begins-early-access-is-a-go/?do=findComment&comment=3454149","commentId":3454149,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1535502872,"content":"> 1 minute ago, DailyRich said:\n> \n> How exactly do you get the early access?  Do you have to purchase one of the packs?\n\nYou can buy one of the founder's packs (or the Limited Edition Collector's Starter Set) to get early access now, or wait for full release; when it will be free-to-play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281707-the-journey-begins-early-access-is-a-go/?do=findComment&comment=3454192","commentId":3454192,"userName":"PastrySandwich","timestamp":1535505835,"content":"> 5 hours ago, banania said:\n> \n> I still had hopes this would never happen.\n\nMay not last long."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281707-the-journey-begins-early-access-is-a-go/?do=findComment&comment=3454336","commentId":3454336,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1535526225,"content":"Note that the higher tier founder packs appear to be traps, and the most cost-effective approach is to start with the cheapest pack (or wait for EA to finish and get no pack at all) and then purchase quests and heroes up to your budget."}]}
