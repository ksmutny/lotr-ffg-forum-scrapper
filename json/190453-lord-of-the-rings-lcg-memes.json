It's nothing but off-putting and immature. If there were only one or two instances I wouldn't bother, but right now all 8 woman character cards I've seen in there have fallen victim to it. If the characters are \"awesome\" in the first place, why the need to make it all about gender and sexuality?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190453-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-memes/?do=findComment&comment=1839033","commentId":1839033,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1444251235,"content":"I wonder how confused the COTR guys must be at this.

That said, I'll take a SJW over a troll any day, even if I happen to disagree.

I find it sad that such a well-known podcast resorts to name-calling when they can't defend an argument.\n\nOK, so this is my last piece on this particular topic, since I don't sense an amenable resolution imminent, it's probably best to just agree to disagree. That said:\n\n1) I called no names. I said I'd take a Social Justice Warrior over a troll. (As an aside, I looked up the top few definitions for SJW as well, so I could see if we were on the same page, turns out the Internet's accepted definition is harsher than I had understood it to be)\n\n2) I did defend my point, though. Fairly eloquently, I thought. I explained why I feel the jokes being made were not blatantly sexist. If you didn't find the argument to be sufficient, that's your prerogative.\n\n3) You are totally allowed to disagree with me. I'm fine with that. Hopefully you can live with my disagreeing with you. Let's not get too wrapped up in this. They're not even my jokes.\n\nI wish you a genuine good day and hope we can move on to funny jokes about the game we play, which was the intent of my creating this thread. Hopefully not everyone is scared off."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190453-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-memes/?do=findComment&comment=1839876","commentId":1839876,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1444308297,"content":"> I think it is a parody of sexist jokes.\n> \n> It ridicules the reader's automatic expectation of being served some \"filth\". If anything, I would say it is a statement against sexism.\n\nIt's not in any way a parody of sexist jokes. The \"anti-joke\" idea is a crude excuse to normalise a warped view of women.\n\nL3afonthewind:\n\n1) You did not reject the term when quoting Gizlivadi, which you should explicitly have if you did not agree with the sentiment.\n\n2 and 3) You have not provided any kind of explanation as to why you leave this content up online when all the female characters have fallen victims to this. It's not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing - the memes promote objectification and ridicule of women. Bad humor is not an excuse for bigotry. My fiancées only reaction when I showed her the pictures was \"this kind of jokes only confirms my stereotypes of the average male boardgamer\".\n\nI'm done with this thread too, and I'm certainly done with your Facebook page.\n\nedit: for reference, I thought I would add that I'm about as conservative as it gets according to my country's standards and unlike most I'm not a feminist. If you ever travel to Northern Europe with this kind of gender perspective, good luck...\n\nEdited October 8, 2015 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190453-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-memes/?do=findComment&comment=1839922","commentId":1839922,"userName":"l3afonthewind","timestamp":1444309813,"content":">  \n> \n> > I think it is a parody of sexist jokes.\n> > \n> > It ridicules the reader's automatic expectation of being served some \"filth\".

I get the idea behind the fakeout and punchline, and how it could potentially be seen as empowering or dignifying. However, and I hate to jump on the SJW bandwagon, but I just have to agree that these feel very off-putting. Even if the point is not to deliver on a sexist joke, just putting the caption \"I give the best head\" on an image of Galadriel feels objectifying. Much like the successful black man meme, the fact that it recognizes what would be offensive and suggests at it, even if not delivering on it, feels rather offensive.\n\n \n\nIt's like one of those recent Family Guy jokes, where they hint or show something shocking and terrible and then go \"It's funny because it's offensive\" and expect us to laugh. To me, it only leaves a bad taste in my mouth."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190453-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-memes/?do=findComment&comment=1840816","commentId":1840816,"userName":"Mich the One","timestamp":1444341395,"content":"Oh, I don't think anyone argues for good taste of those memes. \n\n \n\nBut I do get your point.
