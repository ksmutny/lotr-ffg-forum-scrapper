I've heard of the Dragon before but there are few in Gondor that know much about him.  I doubt those dwarves will get far at all!  Well, I better be going, there are many more soldiers to be trained!\n\n \n\nYour turn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86139-middle-earth-background/?do=findComment&comment=811708","commentId":811708,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1373492180,"content":"I think i would want to be a dunedain ranger of the north.  Silently going about my business of protecting the free people of middle earth from evil without gratitude or acknowledgment.  I have no specific profession unless you count wilderness survival which i practice on a daily basis or possibly hunting but only for subsidence for myself or others.  I love nature and living life out doors although ive always wanted to visit Rivendell and pay respects to Elrond in his majestic halls.  It would be an honor to meet him especially after going on orc hunting raids with his sons on more than one occasion   "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86139-middle-earth-background/?do=findComment&comment=811714","commentId":811714,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1373492673,"content":"> I think i would want to be a dunedain ranger of the north.  Silently going about my business of protecting the free people of middle earth from evil without gratitude or acknowledgment.  I have no specific profession unless you count wilderness survival which i practice on a daily basis or possibly hunting but only for subsidence for myself or others.  I love nature and living life out doors although ive always wanted to visit Rivendell and pay respects to Elrond in his majestic halls.  It would be an honor to meet him especially after going on orc hunting raids with his sons on more than one occasion   \n\nWe could have great fun together :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86139-middle-earth-background/?do=findComment&comment=811716","commentId":811716,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373492698,"content":"nice thread. i am torn between two\n\n \n\ni have always found the dunedain the most 'roleplay' luring for me. wandering the wilderness, protecting hobbits, drinking pints with gandalf in the prancing pony, going on errands for the white council....sweet. i would wander the little known areas of middle earth...take a stroll through moria's secret paths.\n\n \n\nor....\n\n \n\ngiven my background in real life, i would want to be a student of lore..someone who discovers the workings of middle earth...the physics. i think saruman would be closest to what i am in real life...though without the urge to rule the world haha\n\n \n\ni suppose i could be a lore-learned ranger? sounds good to me....\n\nrich\n\nEdited July 10, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86139-middle-earth-background/?do=findComment&comment=811731","commentId":811731,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1373493811,"content":"So you are jealous, prideful, and think Radagast is a fool.  Got it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86139-middle-earth-background/?do=findComment&comment=811778","commentId":811778,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373496766,"content":"> So you are jealous, prideful, and think Radagast is a fool.  Got it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nbut i do know how to make a terrific exit though..... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86139-middle-earth-background/?do=findComment&comment=811991","commentId":811991,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1373523164,"content":"Ha ha is funny idea.

(get that from my Took side)... I tried putting some of Pop's best Old Toby into some of Ma's fudge cake-squares, just to see what would happen....  I'm not allowed in the kitchen for the rest of the month   <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]  \n\n \n\nOh, and watch out for that Mr. Thomas Schmidt... far be it from me (an upstanding hobbit, to be sure) to talk ill about anyone... but he lives a little too close to that cooky old Bilbo.  (I think his cousin even gardens for him!)  He likes to invite people over for meals, and we all know what happened the last time people got together in that neck of the Shire...  Hobbits started disappearing.  I heard dwarves were pillaging pantries left and right.  And someone even said that a dragon attacked during a party!  You never hear of that unseemliness going on in Michael Delving.  We're much more civilized out our way..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86139-middle-earth-background/?do=findComment&comment=812424","commentId":812424,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373572862,"content":"excellent. its nice to see people going for the hobbit life as well as the life of danger!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86139-middle-earth-background/?do=findComment&comment=812430","commentId":812430,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1373573339,"content":"Well, as I've stated before, my favorite characters are actually the Dunedain.  I love the combination of nobility and tragedy that makes up their back-story... but short of NEEDING to live a life of conflict, and if I had to settle in one place to live, the Shire would be it.  I couldn't live underground with the dwarves, the elves are much too refined for my long-term tastes ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png], and Gondorian men are just too... dramatic.  So it would be the open plains and the life of a horse nomad for me, or the beautiful green forests of the Shire...
