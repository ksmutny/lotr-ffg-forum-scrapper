Is it correct that Caradhras would be brought back into the game as an active location?\n\n \n\n \n\nIt's not really clear, and I am unaware of any official ruling on the matter. That being said, part of the forced effect on Stage 2B reads, \"Caradhras becomes the active location.\" It doesn't mention Caradhras being in play; the mountain just \"becomes\" the active location, seemingly irrespective of its current board placement. Thanks to cards like Dimrill Stair and some of the Flight From Moria quest cards, we know that the victory display is not necessarily \"off-limits\" to card effects (although each of those cards specifically mentions the victory display). I'm inclined to say that, since Caradhras just \"becomes\" the active location via the quest card effect, it will be put into play as the active location if you have previously explored it.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62311-caradhras-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=610013","commentId":610013,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1332692996,"content":"Thanks!\n\n \n\nJust finished this game, which was made of pure awesomeness. I was engaged which a Mountain Goblin who had 1 HP left. Black Uruks and Caradhras were in the staging area. I decided to bring Miner of the Iron Hills into play so that I could defat the Goblin that round (thought about an undefended attack but Daughter of the Nimrodel wasn't in my hand at that time - too risky). Bifur and Arwen were committed to the quest, my threat was at 29. Then I drew Mountain Wargs! That would have added 2 additional threat and the Monster Hamster would have attacked me. So I played both my Ancestral Knowldege events (Snowbourn Scout had been played the round before as a meat shield against the Mountain Goblin) and explored Caradhras so the hamster stayed in the staging area (and was defeated by Gandalf's effect next round). Awesome!\n\nAt the end of stage 2B (still no second mountain in sight...) I got \"Fell Voices\" as encounter which forced me to put \"Avalanche!\" and \"Frozen Cold\" at the top of the encounter deck. No chance to explore Caradhras (which came back as my active location) in a single turn. If I chose \"Avalanche!\" as the next encounter, I would have to discard Dáin and Dwalin and every other 1 WP dwarf. If I chose \"Frozen Cold\" I would have to discard Dwalin or Dáin (which means Dwalin). Fortunatly I had \"Shadows of the Past\" in my hand and used it to bring a Mountain Goblin back at the top of the encounter deck, making \"Frozen Cold\" his shadow effect. Then I got Longbeard Mapmaker and with my tons of lore resources I made it over the Caradhras in a single turn. Awesome!\n\nIn 3B Dáin died despite of all my previous efforts (got \"Snowstorm\" as shadow effect). Right afterwards my remaining heroes found a way that led them over the Fanuidhol. Of course, in my last turn I drew another \"Frozen Cold\" and my fellowship had to leave Dwalin behind at the mountain top. Still, I won against all odds and it felt what?\n\n \n\nCorrect: Awesome!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62311-caradhras-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=610022","commentId":610022,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1332695488,"content":"nice game report there- redhorn really is a great quest for r-ping, can make some great epic storylines of heroism"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62311-caradhras-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=610105","commentId":610105,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1332725401,"content":"Hehe, I played something similar yesterday with Boromir sacrificing himself to kill everything (he would have died nevertheless if he'd tried defending against those) engaged with me and Eleanor freezing somewhere in the middle of the journey.
