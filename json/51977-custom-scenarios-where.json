Having picked up on previous comments about the Scouring of the Shire, I decided to try putting together a homemade scenario for it. Having now looked at the massive quality for most custom scenarios, mine falls way flat on the presentation, as I have neither time, tools nor I suspect skill to match the profession jobs on offer.\n\nSo - how do you get the good artwork, integrated into the card frames? Mine is just existing card bases, with the potential infringements that may incur."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51977-custom-scenarios-where/?do=findComment&comment=3849960","commentId":3849960,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1576508893,"content":"> 3 hours ago, Boromore said:\n> \n> So - how do you get the good artwork, integrated into the card frames?
