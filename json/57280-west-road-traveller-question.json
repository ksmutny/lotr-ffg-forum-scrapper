Do they stay on the location (which goes back to staging) and then will be reinstated when this location becomes again active? Or are they put on the new active location?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57280-west-road-traveller-question/?do=findComment&comment=565093","commentId":565093,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1323269147,"content":"The progress tokens would travel with the location, I'm sure.  They don't need to be \"reinstated\" or anything, as a location can be explored while in the staging area if you have cards that can put tokens on them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57280-west-road-traveller-question/?do=findComment&comment=565094","commentId":565094,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1323269329,"content":"radiskull said:\n\nThe progress tokens would travel with the location, I'm sure.  They don't need to be \"reinstated\" or anything, as a location can be explored while in the staging area if you have cards that can put tokens on them.\n\n\n\nOh you are right, many thanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57280-west-road-traveller-question/?do=findComment&comment=565375","commentId":565375,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1323334296,"content":"Also, what do you think of this, Osgiliath says one cannot travel to such and such locations, but West Road Traveller does not say travel, can you switch locations then? My logic would say yes, of course, but I have been wrong (especially with this game) before...\n\n...further, since it does not say travel, you obviously ignore travel effects, right?"}]}
