Maybe in a PoD, maybe in a cycle. If it's a cycle, it will take us time to get there. Why? Because through the Deluxe cycles the designers have established that we are taking a \"Tour of Middle Earth\", with the four most recent cycles showing a deliberate geographic course.\n\n \n\nThe first three cycles did not seem to fit into a directional pattern, but all three cycles took place in different areas of Middle Earth:\n\n \n\n1) Shadows Over Mirkwood - Mirkwood/Anduin/Rhovanion\n\n2) Dwarrowdelf - Misty Mountains, more or less\n\n3) Against the Shadow - Gondor\n\n \n\nThe latest four cycles seem to show a course the designers have laid out intentionally:\n\n \n\n4) Ringmaker - Rohan/Dunland/Southern Eriador\n\n5) Angmar Awakened - Eriador. At this point, we've continued northwest from southern Eriador into the rest of Eriador.\n\n6) Dawnchaser - Grey Havens/ west into Belegaer (The Great Sea), we then sail south on the Great Sea to the Bay of Belfalas and Umbar.\n\n7) Haradrim - picking up directly after the end of the Dawnchaser cycle, we start in Umbar and then head east into the desert of Far Harad.\n\n \n\nAgain, keep in mind that the stories in the Deluxe boxes and APs specifically mention the heroes moving from Rohan to Rivendell (Eriador) to the Grey Havens and then ending/starting in Umbar. This is clearly an intentional route established by the designers.\n\n \n\nThis course suggests that the following cycles after Haradrim will be Khand/Rhun or possibly Mordor. To my knowledge, little to zero textual material exists for Khand and Rhun, so who knows what the designers might create for those regions. Perhaps nothing, since essentially nothing exists. Mordor is, of course, highly developed, so a cycle here seems very likely to my mind. It may be saved for the last cycle of product, however, as it would seemingly be a climatic series of quests. This would then leave the Iron Hills, Erebor, the Withered Heath and Dale as areas for one other cycle. So again, yes, we will visit Dale, though it may not be extensively. With the directional precedent set by the last four cycles, I'd be very surprised if the designers set the next cycle anywhere but Khand/Rhun/Mordor or possibly the Iron Hills. Could they break from this pattern? Sure. But that would be a significant departure from the route we've traveled the past four years (last four cycles).\n\n \n\nTL; DR - We are doing a tour of Middle Earth. Dale is a prominent enough to earn a stop on the tour.\n\nEdited December 16, 2016 by RobOz"}]}
