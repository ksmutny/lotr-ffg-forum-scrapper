Get used to at least one additional quest phase (i.e. the escape check), and usually it's better to let your questing remain stagnant than allow Gollum a chance to make a break for the encounter deck.\n\nIn our first game we didn't realize this and he escaped. He reappeared a few turns later, though - as a shadow card. He went to the discard pile, and we looked at him laying there, then at the size of our remaining encounter deck, and gave up. Not much fun, and really annoying.\n\nIn the second game we boned up on willpower and proxied in some Unexpected Courage. (Yes, proxied, because I'm not dropping $120 just to get four more.) The strategy this time was simply to keep threat as as level as possible and dedicating ourselves to keeping resources off of Gollum. Threat management was made a bit easier by the new Rohan ally - one of those in play kept everything pretty mellow. It was a long game, and we won  - but with four resource tokens on him (due mainly to treachery cards that force additional escape checks), and it was pure luck that the final check of the game passed at all. As luck-driven as this game typically feels, the escape mechanic really exacerbates it. And the new cards - the Worm and the Bog in particular - will not leave play for anything.\n\nThe player cards are generally very good. Boromir is an utter beast, trading 2-3 threat to block and destroy most enemies (in other words, \"The Galadrhim's Greeting\"  is now effective multi-creature removal). Enhanced with a few signal attachments, he makes you feel downright invincible. The leadership cards might be the weakest of the bunch, though they may benefit a mono deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=550897","commentId":550897,"userName":"soullos","timestamp":1320259283,"content":"I just got mine today, but I havn't tried it out just yet.

You can't commit best questers, because they have to guard gollum and you will fail the quest quite a lot of times, so threat may become a problem (35+ cards start to work). It is quite hard to keep gollum on the board, but it is manageable. Still, I love the challenge and I like the quest so far\n\nWhat I dislike:\n\n- when gollum escapes, in my opinion player should lose the game. However, gollum is shuffled into the deck instead. And when it happens, it may take forever to see him again and you can ignore most quest mechanics / new cards. Stalling decks like Beravor + Courage can play for hours and will not lose against this quest (but the score will be ugly)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=551771","commentId":551771,"userName":"Lenbo","timestamp":1320413264,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nHey people command!!!!

Yes maybe you right this game will never come to the same level as AGOT or Magic OR LOTR TCG Decipher.\n\nAnd this make me feel really sad. But ok hope is still there. Will see....\n\n About Designers:  They try to do nightmare mode for players who is already want more challenge. But nightmare mode is a joke in the end of the day  even after second rules changing. Who try it they know what  im talking about.\n\nAny game in my opinion should go from easy to hard. This is logic right???\n\n But in this game is more cards we have with more Adv. packs release more better we can build up the players decks and this is right. If you remember the first decks build up only from core set and compare them to current decks, they are much more weaker. So our players decks now is much more stronger much more!!! And According by logic the quests and encounter decks should be also grow up.Cose we can deal with them even without the new players cards.\n\nBut what about with encounter decks and quests from Adv packs??Some of them even more easy then core set quests!!! Dol-Guldor is for sure more interesting and challenge then Carrock and Anduin is more hard then  then HFG and HOEM.  So I really  happy we have a brilliant Osgiliaht which ine is show : yes they know how to make a good quest. In my opinion the first quest since core set which is good. Can you image if we have all the quests in Cycle like this???Wow!!! And i didn talk only about hard level but also whole level of the quest is really example of good job on any aspect(including story and so on) . And only this still give me hope every think can be ok( in my opinion of course cose most if the players is happy already).\n\nCheers.\n\nAlso i happy to practice my Engilsh typing.

Sure, I got a sequence of flawless victories when the encounter deck was not really trying to beat me. But from time to time, the treacheries can hit really hard or if a few first cards are nasty, the game can change from easy to medium or even hard. Some people would just say \"bad luck, my deck is still invincible and I just lost because of pure misfortune\" . But statistically speaking, in most cases this is not a misfortune, but rather a trend. Which means , the deck can be improved , so the odds are better.\n\nGollum quest is way too easy for solo player (as most of us design decks targeted at quest/threat/location control). Carrock also seems easy, but sometimes, when you get him by 1st/2nd turn sacked or 1st turn deadly snake who kills your hero... All I can say that I really love those games, when the sacked is first or second card - I won 2 out of 3 of such games, but it was very close and the games were very fun.\n\nI also disagree that the old quests are not changing. Think about Rhosgobel. My deck was absolutely hopeless against Rhosgobel, so I had to change Gimli to Legolas and I also added 3x Radagast to the deck. As a result, I have a chance against Rhosgobel (small, but much bigger than before). And, most importantly, some old quests got harder as Gimli was a better fighter in my deck and also Radagast is rather poor ally.\n\nWe have 1 adventure pack left. If it is fight oriented (and I really hope it will be) , most top tier decks who focus on quest/threat/location control will have to adjust so they can handle this new quest. As a result, they will lose some edge over old quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=553094","commentId":553094,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1320673665,"content":"I don't think any deck is invincible.

If you draw 2 Signs of Gollum and 2 Hunters from Mordor in a row, for example, you are in big trouble, but how often will that happen? It is not a trend, it's an exception. \n\nAs for Rhosgobel, the quest didn't change. What changed was your deck and thus, it's ability to handle the quest's obstacles.

It's not bad luck, it's a feature of that quest that is not the most likely to be dominant, but that will inevitably pop up every now and then. If your deck fails against it, it undermines any claims of being able to win 'consistently' against the scenario and it by extension being too easy.\n\n \n\n\n\nYou absolutely right about Rohan deck. If you have a lot of enemies this deck is didn work. I use to like it but try Anduin and you will see. Bad staring hand????

I have all of one loss against Gollum and Emyn Muil combined. I didn't even play Emyn Muil that much because it simply wasn't very interesting. And once you've played  a scenario a few times and you've seen the quest cards and encounter deck, how much can it surprise you? You know everything that's in there already. Please do not think that I'm trying to sound like I'm better than anyone else, because I'll be the first to tell you I'm not. But I don't care too much for putting together a deck that will be less competitive against a scenario simply because it is thematic. I prefer to use the best tools I'm given. \n\n \n\n \n\nI'm just curious, do you find Rhosgobel to be more challenging than Massing at Osgiliath? and if so, why?\n\n\n\n\n \n\nI have not played against Osgiliath. From what I understand, it is far more difficult. My comment was made in reference to the cycle's quests. My apologies if that wasn't made clear.\n\n@ClydeCloggie If I beat Emyn Muil most of the times, but end up with a bad draw \"every now and then\" which causes me to lose, I'm I not still beating it consistently? This is just once again the case of the extreme scenario, which can happen at any point, but very rarely will. This does not mean, however that the scenario is all that difficult, simply that it is capable of getting a tough draw that will overcome any deck. This is a reality for all scenarios, regardless of difficulty. Consistency does not mean that a deck is perfect and will handle every given scenario without breaking a sweat, only that it can win most of the time.\n\nI see a difference of opinion between those that build different \"thematic\" decks to go against the same scenario and those who just play the best deck suitable. There is nothing wrong with either approach, you play the game as you see fit. But understand this: a quest cannot be judged against anything but the best decks that can go against it. Judge it against your best decks, not against all your decks. You cannot judge it against lesser decks and say \"it's not that easy\". That's like riding a bicycle, instead of a car, to work and saying that it takes a long time to get there.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=553956","commentId":553956,"userName":"Puzzle2","timestamp":1320833663,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\nDurinIII said:\n\n \n\nYeah, perhaps I don't play enough to notice it, but Gandalf is hardly ever the make or break of my games.  I still don't think he is \"too good.\"    \n\nI basically agree, but I also have to say that in combination with Born Aloft, Second Breakfast and Erebor Hammersmith I am able to play him eleven times.

Each Gandalf played helps you to reduce your threat, and thus gives you additional time to collect resources to play other stuff beside Gandalf. If you have Mistress of Rivendell and Song of Kings plus Bilbo you can play leadership resources very early in the game without havinga a leadership hero - usually. One reason why I'm happy about the new scoring system, is that a deck like this needs a lot of time to finish the game, so you might win the game, but get a bad result in the end. If you don't care abour scoring though, it still doesn't matter how long it takes before you defeat a scenario.\n\nWhat I wanted to say is that Gandalf himself is not broken, especially because of his costs (like you pointed out), but that a game can get very dull if you're able to play Gandalf 10 times in a row."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=554141","commentId":554141,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1320854928,"content":" yeah, I imagine such a game would get really dull."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=554204","commentId":554204,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1320864519,"content":" I'm still not convinced that it would work.

We also got a lot of cards out because of Bilbo and Elanor. I still like then new escape mechanic\n\nWe were  trying to beat Osigiath i guess 4 times or so until we finally manged  to!  It is horribly difficult and so far it was the one we struggled the most. You have to draw a Gandalf for instance to win and or other wise be extremely lucky with card draw and encouter deck. So far, Osgiliath and Carrock and maybe Dol Gundor are imo the most challenging quests and the ones that i feeled that my 13€ were worth paying for the quest. Ok, fair enough, you still get player cards with the super easy quests like Hills or DM now, but still. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] a bit dissapointing. I belong to the ones that really play for a the challenge and not just for \"theme\" or so. Sure, i love LotR and Tolkien, but if I want to have great story, i ready a book normally. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] So far, the \"story\" told in the adventure packs has really been very simple and not epic at all as well.\n\nNow, lets just hope that from the next expansion on the game will really start to get more and more difficult.\n\nI don't want to take side and divert this into a black and while discussion. For instance  what we do is to use only one Gandalf normally  and we play with one core, two players. In the future, if an adventure pack will have a difficulty less than 6 or 7, I will not use UC or Steward in my deck for sure from the first play on.\n\nWe were have enough easy quests and soon a complete easy adventure cycle (I speak about 1 core, 2 players, 1 Gandalf...) so please let the next ones be really tough! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nStart to wake up more and more. I can sign under any words what you type!!! I laready talk about it for 6 months. Im glad more and more come to certain skill level start to realize there is no challenge any more!!! Let face the true almost all Shadow of Mirkwood Cycle is quite boring. Carrcok, Rhosgobel and look like Return ok. All other is just easy to say: LAIZY BAN WORK OF DESIGNERS.\n\nOk hope next cyrle will be better or it can be beginning of the end.  We need Better Quests!!!!\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nStart to wake up more and more.

Otherwise the chance for him to get discarded as a shadow card or escape test card is too high and the game session degenerates into frustration. Else there is no sense to force players to take an escape test...\n\nAdditionally we will reset the quest to stage 1b if Gollum is not in the staging area during 2b\n\nSomehow this quest feels that it has a couple of major game mechanic flaws...\n\nOr, the easiest solution: If Gollum leaves the staging area at any point of the game, you lose.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI'll agree with Shelfwear here... It's not that I don't like a challenge, and it IS a challenge to get Gollum out in Staging again, believe me.

Between questing and escape tests, with three players we were going through the encounter deck pretty fast. We were close to completing the first stage of the quest and there were only three cards left in the encounter deck. Gollum had 4 resource tokens and we just drew the Treachery card that puts two more on him (reduced to 1 if a Lore character gets exhausted) and we hit upon the realization...if we let Gollum take the two tokens and then purposefully lose the escape test then he'll get put back into the scant encounter deck and then get drawn next turn and be devoid of resource tokens.\n\nI couldn't see anything that prevented this from being a valid loophole.\n\nI suppose there was some risk that on the next turn we could have drawn a Treachery card asking for an Escape test, but since I was using Elenore, even the risk of that occurring was mitigated."}]}
