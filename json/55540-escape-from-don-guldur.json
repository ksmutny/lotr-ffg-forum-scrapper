Then I draw 3 encounter cards and attach to each objective. Are these like shadow cards and placed face down? or do I turn them up and place them under the Objective? If they are turned over am I right in understanding the only actions that could occur at that time are surge and doomed?When Revealed effects do not occur? Do I count thier threat at questing?\n\n2.) Ok I am playing with my own solo variant here in which I choose my hero to send to prison. So as I start the game with my 2 heros..how do I get the objective? If it is a location I travel?, a Treachery? or an enemey I attack?\n\n \n\nI get the direction of the quest but need some help on how to play this the right way..\n\n \n\nThanks\n\nZaxxor"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55540-escape-from-don-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=549367","commentId":549367,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1319998892,"content":"1.) No, they're attached face up. You've got to see the guarding card, so you can attack it sometime (in case of an enemy) or explore it (in case of a location). You're lucky in case of a treachery card: since the Dol Guldur setup says to \"attach\" and not to \"reveal\", the \"when revealed effect\" of the treachery card is not handled; and the objective is free from an encounter, too, and could be claimed any time an action could be triggered.\n\n2.) You get the objectives by triggering their action (and increasing threat by 2). You can only do this if the objective card is unguarded. To get rid of a guarding location, travel to it like to any normal location. (The guarded objective remains directly under the guarding card.) When the guarding location is fully explored, it gets discarded, and then the objective is free, and you can trigger the action. Likewise with an enemy: Kill the enemy, and then you can claim the objective by triggering its action.\n\nBtw, Dol Guldur is pretty hard, I never managed it in solo play. Don't despair ;-)    (I only have 1 core set. With 2 players, it's tough but doable.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55540-escape-from-don-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=549461","commentId":549461,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1320019738,"content":"HilariousPete said:\n\n1.)

Here are the three possibilities I can remember to deal with this:\n\na.) Attach 3 cards. \"When Revealed\" effects don't get resolved, because the setup text says to attach and not to reveal. This overrides (by the golden rule, rulebook page 4) the text of page 24 silverhand quoted. Because \"When Revealed\" effects are only resolved when the text specifically uses a form of the word \"reveal\", this is not the case here (FAQ rule 1.22).\n\nb.) Attach and reveal 3 cards. You can argue that the Guarded keyword is only a \"copy and paste\" command for the text on rulebook p. 24. So the whole paragraph about Guarding in the rule booklet would be considered printed on the 3 objective cards. Thus the golden rule can't apply (because it only deals with conflicts betwen card texts and rule texts), and so you would have to resolve the \"when revealed\" effects.\n\nc.) Attach 3 cards, and reveal 3 cards (so 6 guarding the 3 objectives!). Since the \"Guarded\"=\"reveal\" on the objectives and the \"attach\" on the setup doesn't conflict, you can argue that you have to resolve both texts, thus drawing 2 guarding cards for each objective. (Like when you have 2 Dunedain Warnings, the character also gets +1 defense from the first card, and +1 defense from the second card, so +2 in total). This is perhaps the solution with the least rules troubles, but I absolutely don't think this is intended by the quest.\n\nNote that these are my personal reasonings, other people might argue in another way.\n\nIn the link above, there's a link by radiskull to a BGG site where a player published a rules question about this issue.

Hopefully, the \"and attach 1 encounter to each objective\" is only a reminder and not considered valid. Another member of this forum submitted a rules question and will post it when he gets an answer. And the reason for option b.) has now changed dramatically, of course. Better forget that \"copy and paste\" thinking.\n\n@Silverhand: Sorry for arguing away your original way of playing it! ;-) But before the erratum of the text has been published in v.1.2, the rules suggested option a.) to me as the \"more\" proper way than other options.
