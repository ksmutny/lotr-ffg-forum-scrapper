It would have to be limited edition, but I could easily justify paying $80 - $100 for a collection of the gorgeous artwork that has come out for this game. Off of the top of my head I love Shrouded Hills from The Lost Realm and Heed the Dream from Flight of the Stormcaller. Would anyone else be interested in this? What are some of your favorite pieces of art in the game?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306220-i-know-itll-never-happen-but/?do=findComment&comment=3901507","commentId":3901507,"userName":"TheSpitfired","timestamp":1582602629,"content":"At the risk of sounding like the sellout that I am I do have to say that the limited collector's edition starter set was packed with extended art cards. The heroes, the allies, events, attachments, even the encounter cards. They stand out and there is something gorgeous about them.\n\nIf they re-issued more packs/expansions for the game with the cards made like that I would have a hard time not buying them.\n\nIt is really hard to choose favorite art in this game, there are so many cards I absolutely love and I have gushed over the art of multiple cards multiple times. For the sake of not writing a book or listing almost every card I'll limit my picks to my current deck and the most recent deluxe expansion.\n\nA Shadow in the East - Ally Pippin, Khamul the Easterling, The One Ring.\n\nIn my deck - Ally Quickbeam, Saruman's Staff. Saruman, Leaflock. Actually almost all the Ent art for that matter. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] \n\nSuffice to say the art has steadfast been one of my absolute favorite things about this great game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306220-i-know-itll-never-happen-but/?do=findComment&comment=3901567","commentId":3901567,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1582610158,"content":"I think this would be a great idea!

I wanted to pick up the collectors edition just for the extra art but shipping to Canada is insane so I'll wait to see if there's still any left next time I'm at the FFG Game Center.\n\nBut I love anything by Magali as well, maybe why my favourite heroes in the game are Legolas and Eleanor (and why I like running those two with a Spirit Glorfindel!)"}]}
