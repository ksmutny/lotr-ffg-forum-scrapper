Indestructible, Ambush, Battle, Siege, etc.\n\n \n\n2.  Stacking - Archery X and Victory X as clear examples and Surge, Guarded, Venom as not so clear examples.  I may be wrong, but I think if all Surge, Guarded, and Venom had \"Surge 1, Guarded 1, and Venom 1\" it would not change how they currently resolve.  It would, however, allow developers to clear up confusion as to whether or not they stack and allow them to create interesting cards with Surge 3 (the horror lol) or Venom 5. \n\nEdited September 16, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187568-double-surges/?do=findComment&comment=1800128","commentId":1800128,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1442440868,"content":">  allow them to create interesting cards with Surge 3\n\n \n\nWhy not just introduce the keyword \"You Lose\" at that point?  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187568-double-surges/?do=findComment&comment=1800521","commentId":1800521,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1442452382,"content":"If we see cards with \"Surge 2\" on them in the Dream-Chaser cycle, I'm blaming you guys for giving Caleb ideas. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187568-double-surges/?do=findComment&comment=1800649","commentId":1800649,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1442456276,"content":"Orc Horn-blower already has the equivalent of Surge 2, and Night Without End(?) from Helm's Deep can \"gain Surge 2\".
