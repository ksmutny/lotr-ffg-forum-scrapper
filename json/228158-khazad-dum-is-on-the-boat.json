Not good for morale... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]. More seriously, I bought the core set 2 almost 2 years ago (I think it was in September or October 2014), I've bought The Dead Marshes AP, then everything in order, and I just purchased Blood of Gondor / Morgul Vale last week.  So I go through 3 cycles in 2 years... so... yeah... don't think I will ever catch up!"}]}
