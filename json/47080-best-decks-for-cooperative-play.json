(Edit: this was an attempt to create the best decks I could without any players using any cards from the same spheres of influence as their partner)\n\nCards that I don't find myself using very often or to their fullest ability (or that are newly swapped in), will be in italics, signifying that I am highly open to suggestions for cards to replace them with (not that I'm not otherwise open to suggestions).  These two decks are of course works in progress, but thus far I’ve had great success with all three scenarios using them played cooperatively.  They were designed specifically to be as synergistic as possible, and I find that this makes them very interdependent.  At the same time, however, they each have very specific, independent goals, and are highly specialized.  I think that each deck is very efficient at doing what it was designed to do, but you are very welcome to arrive at your own conclusion.  Here they are:\n\n \n\nMajor Leadership / Minor Tactics “Tanking” Deck (50 cards)\n\nThe point of this deck is primarily to eliminate Enemies engaged with either player, as well as to generate resources for the other deck and to contribute some questing/exploring progress thanks to Legolas and Blade of Gondolin(s).\n\nHeroes (Starting Threat = 26)\nTheodred (because Aragorn makes starting Threat 30, which would be very bad for Journey Down the Anduin, and Theodred is useful for generating resources for the other deck's Spirit or Lore heroes as necessary, or simply making extra resources for himself)\nGloin (Try to get him reliable healing as soon as possible so he can reliably defend and perpetually generate extra resources)\nLegolas (high attack strength, ranged, with a great ability)\n\n Allies\nFaramir x2 (to help the other deck quest more efficiently and to be used with Grim Resolve)\nGuard of the Citadel x3\nSilverlode Archer x3 (ranged)\nSon of Arnor x3 (useful for pulling enemies out of the staging area during scenario 2, \"rescuing\" the other deck, etc)\nSnowbourne Scout x3\nGondorian Spearman x3\nVeteran Axehand x3\nGandalf x3\n\nAttachments\nCelebrian’s Stone x2 (typically played on Eowyn in the other deck, who is almost always questing)\nSteward of Gondor x3 (probably best used on a Spirit hero in the other deck, as once Lore has played reliable healing their resources become far less important)\nBlade of Gondolin x3 (meant to be played on Legolas to enhance his ability/attack strength, or on Dunhere in the other deck)\nDwarven Axe x2 (most likely to be played on Dunhere in the other deck, so he can one-shot certain enemies in the staging area like Wargs)\nHorn of Gondor x2 (to be played on Legolas, or maybe Beravor in the other deck, as necessary)\n\nEvents\nFor Gondor! x2 (this was recently swapped in, I've yet to be really impressed by it but I can see it being very useful)\nGrim Resolve x2 (expensive, but typically a quest stage finisher and Leadership often ends up with a surplus of resources anyways)\nSneak Attack x3\nValiant Sacrifice x3\nFeint x3 (very good for eating the initial Hill Troll or Nazgul of Dol Guldur's attack before Forest Snare can be played)\nQuick Strike x2 (I just swapped these in because I found myself never using Blade Mastery x2, so I'm not sure how good this is yet)\n\n \n\nMajor Spirit / Minor Lore “Utility” Deck (50 cards)\n\nThe point of this deck is initially to play reliable healing for Gloin in the other deck, or in the case of Scenario 2, to dig for a Forest Snare to throw on the Hill Troll.  This deck focuses on managing Treachery and Location cards revealed from the Encounter Deck, and Dunhere is very useful for taking care of some of the enemies that engage in an \"unconventional\" way, such as Goblin Snipers and Wargs.  This deck is also meant to be a questing powerhouse.\n\nHeroes (Starting Threat = 27)\nDunhere (because I never found myself using Elanor's ability, and he's great for scenario 2)\nEowyn (a questing monster)\nBeravor (for massive card generation, either to dig for cards like Forest Snare or Self Preservation, or to help the other deck draw cards when it finds itself with far more resources than cards in hand)\n\nAllies\nNorthern Tracker x3 (everyone loves this card, and everyone knows why.  Play it as soon as possible)\nWandering Took x3 (I recently swapped these in to replace 3x Lorien Guide, as the guides are more expensive and don't play well with Northern Trackers)\nDaughter of the Nimrodel x2\nGleowine x2\nHenamarth Riversong x2\nMiner of the Iron Hills x2 (because Caught in a Web really hurts dual-sphere decks)\nGandalf x3\n\nAttachments\nThe Favor of the Lady x3 (to be played on Eowyn, who is almost always questing)\nUnexpected Courage x3 (to be played on either Beravor or Legolas, depending upon need)\nDark Knowledge x2  (just recently swapped these in, I figure with them I can maximize resources safely generated by Gloin)\nForest Snare x3\nSelf Preservation x3 (put on Gloin ASAP)\n\nEvents\nA Test of Will x3\nDwarven Tomb x3 (maybe 3 is too much?  I don't see this card played a lot, but the potential is fantastic)\nFortune or Fate x2 (this card is debatable.  Not often used, but either deck could potentially fail if a key hero dies.)\nHasty Stroke x3\nStand and Fight x3 (I don't see this card played much... at all, really, but the potential is fantastic)\nStrength of Will x3\nThe Galadhrim’s Greeting x2 (great card, maybe I could add 1 more if I take out 1 Dwarven Tomb)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47080-best-decks-for-cooperative-play/?do=findComment&comment=471892","commentId":471892,"userName":"avgzxc","timestamp":1305894454,"content":"servant of the secret fire said:\n\n \n\n29 starting threat in a 2 players game and both players use spirit is a joke.The last thing you have in mind with those 2 decks is threat.\n\nTheodred gives you recourses if you exhauste him(that means one less hero for defence/attack) and even if he has unexpected courage his stats are bad  and not even close to Aragorn's stats.\n\nUnexpected courage is not a unique attachment.Both Aragorn and Beravor can have it so you don't have to choose which can have it.\n\nIf Theodred works better for you its ok but for me Aragorn>>>>>Theodred without second thought.\n\n\n\nNo, the joke is 30 threat and Eastern Crows - Surge, Eastern Crows - Surge, 2nd Troll :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nWhy would I play UC on Theodred?

Because you don't use Theodred like you use Aragorn, lol. If you want to play Theodred the same way you play Aragorn then of course he would be weaker. Why? Because using Theodred the same way like you use Aragorn doesn't make sense. 1 resource of choice and 1 will is the \"only\" thing he is good for. Does it make him weak? Well, the fact that he can give resource to any alignment makes makes him easily the strongest hero.\n\nLet's theoretize. 10 turns period. Aragorn accumulates 10 resource, Theodred accumulates 20 resource. Let's buy allies: Aragorn provided 5 Tooks, Theodred provided 5 Trackers. Aragorn = poor and therefore weak. Theodred = rich and therefore strong.\n\nUC is supposed to be used on heroes that actually are good and I agree Aragorn is an ok UC user.\n\nAragorn + UC > Glorfindel + UC: Similar stats but Aragorn has Sentinel.\n\nAragorn + UC < Gimli + UC: Similar stats + Sentinel but Gimli's attack is off the chart.\n\nThe above 3 heroes are weaker UC users than: Legolas (2 attacks, up to (2+1+1)*2 = 8 progress), Dunhere (2 attacks), Denethor(peak, defence) and Beravor (ultimate ownage).\n\nGloin owns with UC, or is average.
