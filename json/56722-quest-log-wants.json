Which is a great thing.  But it seems like it could easily be so much more."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56722-quest-log-wants/?do=findComment&comment=559882","commentId":559882,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1322134971,"content":"I would like to second the op.  The quest log is nice, but it has so much more potential."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56722-quest-log-wants/?do=findComment&comment=560070","commentId":560070,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1322189743,"content":"Eric W said:\n\n4) Put in your partner's heroes in multiplayer games.  In the Ring mouse over it could show your notes and also show the heroes of every other player.\n\n \n\n\n\nAll the above, but particularly this point!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56722-quest-log-wants/?do=findComment&comment=560078","commentId":560078,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1322191126,"content":"Eric W said:\n\nIf anyone at FFG is reading and could pass this on, there are a few things I would really like to see added to the quest log.\n\nIf you want your ideas to have any effect, you should post them using the Support Request link at the bottom of this page.\n\nFFG employees don't read the boards (or rather it's company policy that they don't react on posts with the exception of posts specifically started by one of them to gather feedback)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56722-quest-log-wants/?do=findComment&comment=560123","commentId":560123,"userName":"Eric W","timestamp":1322201843,"content":"I did just that.  Thanks."}]}
