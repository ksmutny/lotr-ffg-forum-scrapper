This week’s tournament rounds the bend toward home in a series of tournaments exploring the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].\n\nWill you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104&efpag=0].\n\nAnd now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!\n\nSolo Player Tournament #7:\n\nQuest: The Dead Marshes\nDeck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + HfG, CotC, JtR, HoEM, & DM Adventure Packs\nNumber of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck\n\nTop Ten:\n\n1. muemakan ~ 25 (Éowyn, Frodo, Théodred)\n2.

Bilbo got attached Protector of Lórien. I sent Theódred, Frodo and the Escort questing. I got dealt Fens and Mires as encounter. 7 WP cs 3 threat meant that I could place 4 progres tokens on the quest card which completed stage 1B. I chose not to travel to Fens and Mires. Frodo goot another extra resource. My remaining combo had no problem to win the escape test.\n\n \n\nRound 3:\n\nI played Unexpected Courage on Bilbo. Then I sent Théodred and him questing and discarded 5 cards for PoL. Only Secret Paths remained in my hand. I had to encounter The Lights of the Dead. I decided not to commit any character for the escape test, so I had to rise my threat by one and add another token on Gollum.\n\nAfter completing stage 2B I made the final escape test. I readied Bilbo and had thus a total WP of 9 against an escape value of 0.
