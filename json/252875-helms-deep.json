I understand your problems, but without knowing what you play tips for improvement are hard to give. Especially in a Saga quest (do you play campaign? What burdens/boons? How set in stone is your hero line-up?).\n\nIn general: The quest is tuff and most of the times a real nailbiter. You need much willpower a good defense plan and a significant amount of attack damage to not get overrun. If you aren't in the driving seat don't hesitate to use a test of will to \"buy\" less encountercards as canceling even not so bad treacheries can give you the room to catch up. Also make sure to give up on the first two siege stages once the time has come. If only one or two progress is left it's highly unlikely that you will be able to stop the orcs from advancing.

And then we die.\n\nSo here are some changes I would propose: \n\n-To counter deeping culvert try Thror's key. Just play it once you got it and trigger the response, once the location shows up. As the textbox is blank it should be zero threat (personally never used the key, but that's how it should work right? It is useful anyway to get rid of some very nasty effects)\n-Add Light of Valinor.\n-cut strength of will (don't help the encounterdeck clear the locations) and hold the line (Using 2-3 characters to fend of one attack is to much to keep up with the enemies I'd say + you can't ready them or is there a tactics icon I don't see?)\n-I wouldn't play the side quest - the investment it needs to clear it is smaller than the benefit in my opinion as you ideally want to quest +/-0 (except you want the active locatio cleared so you can travel to a new one) \n-where is sneak attack there should be Gandalf\n-a solodeck with leadership without steward of gondor! You rarely see those and while it doesn't fit theme-wise it fit's great onto Elrond. I think O Lorien isn't needed if you go with steward.\n-do you run out of cards to play? If so, you might want to cut Nenya and use Galadriel only for draw. You could add Daeron's runes too.\n-Try adding Vilya again. I remember one of Seastan's video's (minimal purchase shadow and flame iirc), where it was the main engine to get ahead of the encounter deck. You might want to add UC in this case, too\n-A test of will is a must and hasty stroke can help too (don't have all the shadow effects in my mind; if they don't hurt you to much leave it out)\n-I don't like capatain's wisedom in this quest, but if you need the ressources keep it. However I doubt it is needed if you add steward.\n-if you lack willpower you migh want to add the sword that was broken for Aragorn. It generates absurd amounts.\n-I would change some other cards. To make it easier to compare I copied your deck and switched the cards as I saw fit: http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/61707 [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/61707]\n\nIt is pretty different from what you are playing and not even close to your level of theme. I would use the possible \"free\" turn one to get a head-start. With stargazer the chances of drawing the burden are reasonably low. And as PAOE said above keep one enemy in the staging area, the little progress is generates should be better than two encounter cards per round. \nI hope this helps^^\n\nUltima ratio: You can change your heroes for free before this quest..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252875-helms-deep/?do=findComment&comment=2854463","commentId":2854463,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1498509437,"content":"Hold the line is a frequent lifesaver in a deck where all newly played allies get +1 defence and don't have to exhaust to commit to the quest. I've never paid any attention to the secondary effect. \n\nStrength of Will is another favourite of mine for how often it's useful in practice, but it dropped out of the main deck somewhere along the Anduin.\n\nVilya by contrast has been generally awful for me and probably requires far more tailoring than I'm willing to do to make it excel. Elrond's the third man in this team and should be respectful to his in-laws and their strange ways.\n\nCaptain's Wisdom is a recent trial addition due to how often I was having heroes standing around ready at the end of rounds, and because I wanted to make the Elladan and Elrohir allies easier to play to try them out. Resources haven't generally been as big an issue for the deck as getting enough cards in hand to spend them, even with Galadriel's card draw (Nenya's skill is only used in emergencies/sprints to the finishline, and if it wasn't for ringbearer resources in the saga I'd have probably dropped it) and picking allies back up.

But I think it is good to have those extreme in a game like LoTR. Because you also have extreme players. Some want to play easy quests on easy mode (may be not because they are beginners but because they intentionally want to play with the worst cards, for example) and some others (like me :D) want to play very hard quests on nightmare.

Get your Henamarth can be very precious to do this. You must also keep an enemy in the staging area in step 1, keep an enemy engaged on the beginning of step 2 and put one (and if possible only one) progression token on step 2. You really don't want to get a second encounter card each turn.\n\nAbout the deck I could speak during a long time but it is easier to share my list: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5670/silvan-deck-for-solo-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5670/silvan-deck-for-solo-1.0]\n\nNenya + archer is an option but I really dislike nenya so I prefer another ally and more resource production for paying lore allies. And I want to thanks you for Sneak attack who is a pretty smart idea in this deck, I have to think about it so I may include it in the future.
