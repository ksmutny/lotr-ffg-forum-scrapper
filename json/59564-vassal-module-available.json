As a proxy for play it did alright. There's a little bit of a learning curve, but as long as your familiar with the game, you should be able to figure it out. I did have trouble with saving a game, though. But all-in-all, it's a well-made substitute for the cards if you're travelling. I obviously prefer playing with my actual cards, but there's no way I'd ever be able to play this game on the bus without Vassal or something similar."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59564-vassal-module-available/?do=findComment&comment=585965","commentId":585965,"userName":"guest455987","timestamp":1327713500,"content":"Budgernaut said:\n\n \n\n So I tried this on the bus on the way to school.
