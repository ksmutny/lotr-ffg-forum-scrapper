The FAQ says that \"After combat\" means \"At the end of the combat phase\". I read that therefore a full combat phase had to be resolved, with Shadow card dealt, Enemy attack resolution followed by Player attack resolution, is able/willing. Thus it was possible to destroy the Wolf before it is returned on the encounter deck. I tried to find an official ruling, but I think this is based on the FAQ and the rewording of \"After combat\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71897-about-wolf-rider-shadow-card/?do=findComment&comment=701791","commentId":701791,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1348820626,"content":" You are correct. After re-read the FAQ (pag.7) I realize that my interpretation isn't correct.\n\n \n\nYou can attack him, because as he was delt as a shadow card and shadow cards are only discarded at the end of combat phase, the shadow effect of Wolf Rider triggers imediatly to attack and the part that refers to putting him on top of the encounter card is only \"triggered\" when you discard the shadow cards. "}]}
