In the meantime, my blog has been busy completing the Ringmaker cycle of scenario analyses for Normal mode. https://visionofthepalantir.com/ringmaker/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/ringmaker/]\n\nI will now move on with the regular progression scenarios of the Angmar Awakened cycle. These will be brought to you over the next months. I am excited about it, as they are really enjoyable. If you want to claim one of the scenarios to analyse yourself, let me know and I will get you hooked up.\n\nI will also be bringing exclusive Vision of the Palantir swag to Con of the Rings for everyone who is a co-author or a Patreon supporter. If you cannot make it to the con, then I will ship it to you. I got the chance to make this for free, so my Patreon money won't be used for it yet. More info about this via this link:Â https://www.patreon.com/vision_of_the_palantir [https://www.patreon.com/vision_of_the_palantir]\n\nThank you for your ongoing support, I hope to bring the first of the Angmar Awakened scenarios shortly besides other articles on the new packs that are being put out!"}]}
