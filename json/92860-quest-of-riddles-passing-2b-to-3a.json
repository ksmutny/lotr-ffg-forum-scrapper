If he finds at least 1 match, discard cards from the encounter deck until another card with a riddle is discarded. Then, answer that riddle.\n\nWhat must you do? Search for new riddle even useless? Must i do the riddle? Instead must i reveal it in staging? While i'm looking for the riddle card, other cards go into play?\n\nEdited October 30, 2013 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92860-quest-of-riddles-passing-2b-to-3a/?do=findComment&comment=899771","commentId":899771,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1383182675,"content":"Here's my take:\n\n \n\nIf you flip to 3B as the result of a riddle, you'll still have to finish the staging step.  Staging would not be cancelled -- under \"Quest Advancement\" near the end of the game manual, it states that the round sequence is not interrupted by flipping a quest card.  Not exactly what we are talking about here, but it's as good a direct as I can find.  In a 2 player game, it would look like:\n \n\n- Reveal first card for staging.  \n\n- Answer riddle.\n\n- Flip to 3B\n\n- Reveal 1 card per player as a result of 3B's \"When Revealed\" effect\n\n- Reveal second card for staging\n\n- Quest resolution\n\n \n\nSo, progress from quest resolution would be placed on 3B, and you could WIN 3B as a result of that questing phase if you have enough quest power.\n\n \n\nIf the riddle that you answered came from It Likes Riddles, I think you should still discard until you find the next Riddle effect -- then ignore it.  The text on 3B would have you ignore the Riddle effect itself, but wouldn't do anything to disrupt the \"search\" effect from the When Revealed text of It Likes Riddles. \n\n \n\nBut what order to resolve effects?  I think you would completely resolve It Likes Riddles before resolving the When Revealed text on 3B, but I am not sure.  So: 1) reveal the first card for staging, 2) answer riddle, 3) place progress and flip to 3B, 4) do the discard per the text on It Likes Riddles but ignore the Riddle effect, 5) then reveal 2 cards per 3B's text, 6) then reveal the second card to finish the staging step.  But I am not sure whether (4) and (5) should be done in the opposite order, and I would like to hear others' thoughts!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92860-quest-of-riddles-passing-2b-to-3a/?do=findComment&comment=899951","commentId":899951,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1383215902,"content":"Ok, thanks for your answer.\n\n \n\nAnother question i forgot in my ask:\n\n \n\n1a text says: Forced: Reveal 1 additional encounter card per player during the staging step.\n\n...then, even if you pass to 3a, must you reveal additional cards by 1a step text?\n\n \n\nM1568.png [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Images/Cards/Medium/M1568.png]\n\n \n\nIn the example of this post, it would be 3 more cards!
