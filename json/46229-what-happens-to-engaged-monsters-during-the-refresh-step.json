Is that correct... so if a monster attacks or defends an attack with a hero / ally... that character is effectively tapped until the next combat step either kills it or kills the monster.. is that correct? Or dose it simple refresh and the entire turn goes as the one before it?\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46229-what-happens-to-engaged-monsters-during-the-refresh-step/?do=findComment&comment=463157","commentId":463157,"userName":"Fotonurth","timestamp":1304466420,"content":" The monsters stay engaged, but everything refreshes at the end of the round.

So lets say you've refreshed, done your planning, committed, and done encounters.\n\nWhen it comes time for him to attack you, you may choose to defend it like always. Then have another character attack him. If you have ready characters.\n\n \n\nAnd I believe threat is still counted, that's how we've been playing here and it feels right."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46229-what-happens-to-engaged-monsters-during-the-refresh-step/?do=findComment&comment=463175","commentId":463175,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1304468652,"content":"Threat is not counted once the monster is engaged.
