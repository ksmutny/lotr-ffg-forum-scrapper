In other words, is an entire cycle's set of cards designed at once and then \"simply\" split up between the 6 Adventure Packs? How far ahead do they design? I would assume the Mirkwood Cycle was designed in conjunction with the Core Set but how far ahead do they go?\n\nI would love to see articles from FFG not only spoiling cards but giving us insight into their design process and how they plan for the future of the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66604-developmentdesign-of-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=650066","commentId":650066,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1340719618,"content":"im pretty sure there have been articles like you ask for- i remember last year there was an interview with nate french on the design aspect, and theres also a video interview on the onering.netâ€¦..i think if you google it you should find it. i havnt got time now, but if i do ill have a look for you"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66604-developmentdesign-of-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=650095","commentId":650095,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1340723227,"content":"There's a write-up of the interview with Nate French from last October here [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/707056/nate-french-on-theonering-net]."}]}
