I had defended an attack with Gildor, but the shadow card attached 2 poison to him and he was rendered unconscious, removing him from defending. My question now is: can I declare another ready character as the defender? Or even if all 3 of my heroes are readied does this just immediately become an I undefended attack?\n\nEdited January 30, 2014 by Chris51261"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98102-undefended-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=969377","commentId":969377,"userName":"vjg13","timestamp":1391124523,"content":"you'd still be in the middle of resolving the attack and have to complete all the\n\nsteps. the attack would br undefended"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98102-undefended-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=969380","commentId":969380,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1391124725,"content":"yes, very nasty that quest. I dont like, because i suffer too much.\n\nMaybe one of the most dificult quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98102-undefended-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=969423","commentId":969423,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1391129418,"content":"I just got through it for the first time today, stalling on the first part of the quest and building up my forces helped a lot. I think what confused me here was they included the \"attacking a character\" rules, like with Crazy Cob. I thought I had been playing undefended attacks all wrong, but I thought this was how they were. Thanks guys!"}]}
