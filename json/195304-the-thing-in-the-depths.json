For example, in Angmar Awakened: Merry had Curious Brandybuck and Hobbit Pony, Dori had Longbeard Sentry, Erestor had Galdor of the Havens, Amarthiúl had Guardian of Arnor, and Arwen has Elvish Light and Tale of Tinuviel. The exceptions are Mirlonde and Rossiel (Advance Warning and Leave no Trace are connected mechanically, not thematically), and Mablung (where Galdhon Archer and Bow of the Galadhrim both support the cycle's Silvan focus). The article said it would be a Spirit hero, and both Spirit cards in this pack are hobbit-themed, so a hobbit hero seems likely. Since there are already Spirit hero versions of Frodo, Merry, Pippin, and Fatty (and Sam is an ally here), there's a good chance we'll continue the Mirlonde-Idraen-Rossiel tradition of the second pack having an FFG-created (female?) hero. We could also get a new Bilbo hero, Rosie Cotton, Farmer Cotton, Farmer Maggot, or even Folco Boffin.\n\n \n\nA detail I noticed in the last two announcement articles:\n\n>  \n> \n> Flight of the Stormcaller introduces a new Leadership hero and three copies each of ten different player cards.\n\n>  \n> \n> The sixty new cards in The Thing in the Depths allow you to determine the course of the resulting battle, even as they introduce a new Spirit hero and three copies each of eight different player cards, including innovative new allies for each of the four spheres.\n\n \n\nIt looks like they're giving themselves more design space by allowing for some quests to have more new encounter cards, while still roughly keeping the same player card progression rate.\n\n \n\nOn another point, I would love it if the support for decks with fewer than three heroes (mentioned in the Flight of the Stormcaller announcement article) were worded so that it helps a deck with two regular heroes and one saga hero. I would love to play the quests from The Land of Shadow and the sixth saga box with a thematic Galadriel-Sam-Frodo deck, using very few allies (Gandalf and Elrond, with some Gondor rangers in The Land of Shadow). This needs more support to work, and it would be disappointing if such a card (intended to support decks that don't use a full set of heroes) doesn't work for saga quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195304-the-thing-in-the-depths/?do=findComment&comment=1925412","commentId":1925412,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1449623229,"content":"Good catch on the number of player cards in the packs.

Desperate times call for desperate measures. Given the fact that he can be readied during the quest if you're lucky, then he is 3 wp for questing and then 2 atk/def for combat. Doing this each turn will obviously put a dent on your economy, however he costs 1 (I don't think I'll be ever running him without Frodo) and that leaves some space for triggering his ability, especially when it makes the difference between defended and undefended attack, or those pesky 1-2 attack you're lacking to defeat a worthy foe looming over you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195304-the-thing-in-the-depths/?do=findComment&comment=1925767","commentId":1925767,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1449651654,"content":"Tactics Boromir goes great with ally Sam.

And that one can attack the staging area too, which to me is more of a Spirit thing to do. And speaking of something \"tactics only\", out of 3 printed ranged Tactics heroes, only legolas is at the threat cost of 9, other two guys are 10 and 11. It won't change one thing: tactics has a lot of stuff to pump that ranged stuff into oblivion, and spirit has little to none. And that's where true sphere identity lies.\n\nI don't see the point in describing the game as is since I was talking about what I would prefer. It seems to me you yourself do that quite often. I think it is a shame that Legolas is the only 9 threat ranged hero in tactics. By the way the Outlands hero is also ranged for 8 threat in leadership, which annoys me. Look, basically I think any stats can be available to any hero in any sphere. I would just prefer if only high threat heroes had off color stats. So, red would have the low threat high attack, spirit would have low threat high wp. I also think ranged should be common in red, but rare and high threat cost in other colors. I don't run the company or the game design so my opinion doesn't matter, but that doesn't mean it's silly or ig oran of the game.
