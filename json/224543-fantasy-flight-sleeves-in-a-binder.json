I'd much prefer a binder over a box, but I can't afford to experiment with the inserts unless I know they will fit. Has anyone done anything similar with their collection?\n\nEdited July 8, 2016 by Arromir"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224543-fantasy-flight-sleeves-in-a-binder/?do=findComment&comment=2300972","commentId":2300972,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1467990258,"content":"Doubt it.

The sleeved cards fit nicely in the sideloaded pockets. You can easily fit 2 sleeved cards per slot, but 3 is pushing it. But the binders are fixed with no room to add new pages, so I don't know if it would fit your needs as you did mention binder inserts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224543-fantasy-flight-sleeves-in-a-binder/?do=findComment&comment=2301901","commentId":2301901,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1468037951,"content":"Fun fact: I used to think of binder as some diabolic machince that is used to shred paper, and useless cards in particular.
