When Legolas has 3 str and a stray goblin 3 str as well, I do not treat their str as equal. In my mind (and I dare say that this is the correct approach), the stray goblin does not represent just a goblin, but rather a whole unit of stray goblins who add their respective str to reach the number 3 to be on par with Legolas. When Legolas kills a Goblin Swordsman, he didn't kill just a goblin, but he dispatched a whole unit of them.The same goes with bosses (the unique enemies). A john doe's str might exceed Gandalf's, but I never consider that particular john doe to be stronger that Gandalf. As a boss, it probably has a whole retinue with it to support it. All of them add their str, hence they might surpass Gandalf's. Strength in numbers.\n\n \n\nOn a similar note, the same can be said about mounts for instance: how can a hero ride two different mounts and enjoy the benefits of both of them at the same time (because, if he enjoyed their benefits at different times, that would have been normal - a knight for example didn't have just one horse when he went to war)? Well, I treat it mostly as \"he rides just one horse, but that one horse is much better than the average one\". If Legolas has two Rohan Warhorses attached for instance, he doesn't jump from one to the other (though Jackson's film obviously disagrees). It just means that the particular warhorse Legolas is riding, is better than the usual Rohan warhorses. When Eomer has both Firefoot and Rohan Warhorse attached, he just rides Firefoot, but at that particular day (the one that the quest takes place), Firefoot is on steroids. And so on. Though, to be fair, I'd like a rule addition that limits the mounts to one per hero.\n\n \n\nIt's really easy to see further than pure stagnant numericals.\n\n \n\n \n\n> What attachments would you need to make boromir and legolas attack 7?\n\n \n\nApart from the various weapons, there are always the Dunedain Marks which aren't restricted. I like those signals more and more. For Legolas in particular, Rivendell Bow is not restricted too, so you may combine it with restricted weapons.\n\nEdited January 13, 2015 by Serazu"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131760-my-one-frustration-with-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1404243","commentId":1404243,"userName":"OMZA","timestamp":1421149735,"content":"Rivendell blade can also count for Legolas' attack. of course, that particular card is not a real attack bonus, but almost always it will be equal to a + 2 attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131760-my-one-frustration-with-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1404279","commentId":1404279,"userName":"muttlee","timestamp":1421152447,"content":"Serazu I love your way of thinking when it comes to this game.

Here is the deck I have been using based around the Silvan theme. It's best at ranged attacks and supporting questing over the course of the game so works best multiplayer and paired with some sort of defense based deck. It's not a perfect deck, I still have tweaking to do, but I hope it helps you with your own deck.\n\n \n\nDeck Created with CardGameDB.com The Lord of the Rings Deckbuilder [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/thelordoftherings/the-lord-of-the-rings-deckbuilder]\n\nTotal Cards: (55)\n\nHero: (3)\n\n1x Legolas (Core Set) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/legolas-core]\n\n1x Celeborn (The Dunland Trap) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/the-dunland-trap/celeborn-r1128]\n\n1x Haldir of Lórien (Trouble in Tharbad) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/trouble-in-tharbad/haldir-of-lo%CC%81rien-r1178]\n\nAlly: (23)\n\n3x Rivendell Minstrel (The Hunt for Gollum) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/the-hunt-for-gollum/rivendell-minstrel-thfg]\n\n2x Daughter of the Nimrodel (Core Set) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/daughter-of-the-nimrodel-core]\n\n3x Naith Guide (The Dunland Trap) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/the-dunland-trap/naith-guide-r1129]\n\n3x Silvan Tracker (The Dead Marshes) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/the-dead-marshes/silvan-tracker-tdm]\n\n2x Gandalf (Core Set) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/gandalf-core]\n\n2x Rúmil (The Three Trials) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/the-three-trials/ru%CC%81mil-r1155]\n\n2x Galadhrim Minstrel (Trouble in Tharbad) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/trouble-in-tharbad/galadhrim-minstrel-r1185]\n\n2x Galadhon Archer (The Nin-in-Eilph) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/the-nin-in-eilph/galadhon-archer-r1222]\n\n2x Defender of the Naith (Trouble in Tharbad) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/trouble-in-tharbad/defender-of-the-naith-r1187]\n\n2x Orophin (Celebrimbor's Secret) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/celebrimbor-s-secret/orophin-r1260]\n\nAttachment: (16)\n\n1x Song of Wisdom (Conflict at the Carrock) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/conflict-at-the-carrock/song-of-wisdom-catc]\n\n3x Rivendell Blade (Road to Rivendell) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/road-to-rivendell/rivendell-blade-rtr]\n\n1x Song of Battle (The Dead Marshes) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/the-dead-marshes/song-of-battle-tdm]\n\n2x Elven Mail (The Three Trials) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-ring-maker-cycle/the-three-trials/elven-mail-r1156]\n\n2x O Lórien!
