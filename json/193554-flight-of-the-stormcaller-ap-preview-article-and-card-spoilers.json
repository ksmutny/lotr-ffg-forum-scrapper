Tides of Fate could be fun, and as I've found with Boomed and Trumpeted, an attack boost of 3 is enough that it doesn't really matter if the defending character didn't have very good attack to start with. Robin Smallburrow is another 2 cost 2 willpower ally in Lore so should see a lot of play even without the ability, and Inspiring Presence could be bonkers in the right context."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193554-flight-of-the-stormcaller-ap-preview-article-and-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1894094","commentId":1894094,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1447566815,"content":"Very cool!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193554-flight-of-the-stormcaller-ap-preview-article-and-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1894937","commentId":1894937,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1447654589,"content":"Now we know which kind of card would beat spirit Glorfindel:\n\n \n\nspirit Glorfindel! ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]\n\n \n\nCards are looking great, though solo players are a bit restricted in their deck building with the new effects.\n\n \n\nThat hobbit is great and likely an auto-include even without his special ability.
