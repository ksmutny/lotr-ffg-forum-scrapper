I believe the exception to that rule is if an event like Quick Strike is played to trigger one of the attacks (don't have time to check the rulebook/FAQ... I'm sure someone else will correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nBut a normal attack and an attack triggered by Quick Strike against the same foe would still need to be resolved separately.\n\n  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3062988","commentId":3062988,"userName":"ovinomanc3r","timestamp":1509742357,"content":"How stand together really works? \n\nStand-Together.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Core-Set/Stand-Together.jpg]\n\nAs I understand it simply means during combat phase I may declare aditional defenders against engaged enemies instead of the limit of 1 as long as they could defend normally. \n\nSo exhausted characters cannot defend playing this card. \n\nAlso each character only can defend against 1 enemy not against each enemy.
