It's a response, which limits it to 3.A\n\nIf it were an action, then your analysis would be correct.\n\n@ovinomanc3r [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/258337-ovinomanc3r/], Actions can be used in any action window (in the back of the rulebook - any of the green phases). Responses can only be used when their trigger is met - which can be in any phase, red or green. In the case of Northern tracker, the trigger is \"When you commit Northern Tracker to the quest.\"\n\nSo, you commit it to a quest, add a progress token to every location in the staging area, and then reveal cards, just like you said.\n\nEdited September 23, 2017 by Onidsen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259262-noob-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2995388","commentId":2995388,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1506193025,"content":"> 1 minute ago, Onidsen said:\n> \n> Actually, Northern Tracker doesn't have an action.

Only three games so not too much to compare but 1st 67, 2nd 159, 3rd 102.\n\nSame deck, same quest, not many problems during any game, just more or less time to draw some cards.
