Stagnant Creek forces everyone's threat up by 5. I am eliminated, reducing our questing willpower by 10+.\n\nI don't remember what player 2 revealed, but the threat in the staging area was 20+ in the end.  She had to raise her threat by 10 or more, leaving her around 46.  We quit at that point because she had no way to deal with the massive threat in the staging area on her own.\n\nMy own fault for letting my threat get so high… but man, that quest can be tentacle hell!"}]}
