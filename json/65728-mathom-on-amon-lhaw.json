Since the Mathom triggers AFTER a location is explored I see nothing wrong with it or with its text. Let's say the Ancient Mathom triggers when you \"discard\" (in this case put into your victory display) the location…so it is not the ACTIVE location anymore…at least I see it like that…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65728-mathom-on-amon-lhaw/?do=findComment&comment=643915","commentId":643915,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1339570601,"content":" But you see, the card text that has the response needs to be there when the triggering effect happens. While questing in this situation, Ancient Mathom has no text, and therefore no response. Once the location is explored, the text returns, but now the triggering event is past, so you can't fulfill Ancient Mathom's response text. I think you simply discard the card without drawing the three cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65728-mathom-on-amon-lhaw/?do=findComment&comment=643922","commentId":643922,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1339572960,"content":" the text reads : \"after attached location is explored \" this means you have a small window open to trigger the effect…if it said \"when\" I would agree with you…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65728-mathom-on-amon-lhaw/?do=findComment&comment=644354","commentId":644354,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1339641663,"content":" Hmmm.

I still think it makes more sense that you don't draw cards, but I'm glad to have an official ruling. Despite my opinion, I'll play it this way from now on without questioning it."}]}
