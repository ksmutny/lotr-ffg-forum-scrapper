Does the shadow effect on Hunters from Mordor apply to all players or just the one that is engaged with the enemy with that card? Player 1 had one hero with one clue card and player 2 made an undefendet defence and got shadow wffect: \"Deal 1 damage to each hero with a clue card. (3 damage if undefendet) ) So, does this apply to ALL heroes regardles of who controles them or just the ones controled by player 2?\n\nMaking sense? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74750-and-a-quick-question-regarding-shadowcards/?do=findComment&comment=727726","commentId":727726,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1353858346,"content":" All heroes that have a clue attached… So all players"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74750-and-a-quick-question-regarding-shadowcards/?do=findComment&comment=727729","commentId":727729,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1353858570,"content":" Thanks.
