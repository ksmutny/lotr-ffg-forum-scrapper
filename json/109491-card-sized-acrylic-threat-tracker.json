It all looks nice to me, thanks for sharing!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109491-card-sized-acrylic-threat-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=1134785","commentId":1134785,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1403827597,"content":"If it was available outside of the US and postage wasn't too full on I would definitely buy 3x\n\nf18c255f210977d462cf965b870fd938_large.g [https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/167/183/f18c255f210977d462cf965b870fd938_large.gif?1403189059]\n \n\nand 3 or 4x 56cfe3d34014be9f4ab23d8eef2ead1b_large.g [https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/167/184/56cfe3d34014be9f4ab23d8eef2ead1b_large.gif?1403189076]\n\n \n\nBoth are amazingly helpful with storage and I'd love to get my hands on them.. anyway I can organise with you to do this?\n\nPerhaps through ebay or something? So long as you are obviously going to mail them eventually I wouldn't mind a bit of a wait either, they look that good, honestly! No worries if this is too difficult or costly for you but yeah I'd really love a whole handful of those box inserts as they would help me so so much.\nWell done with all of what you're working on by the way, very impressed.\n\nEdited June 27, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109491-card-sized-acrylic-threat-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=1134882","commentId":1134882,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1403834295,"content":"Fancy!
