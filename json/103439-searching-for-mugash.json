Next second effect: if mugash is in play.\n\nI think mugash is not in play at this moment because you dont have placed yet the progress tokens (resource token instead), because you havent explored yet the active location.\n\n \n\nIsnt?\n\nEdited April 8, 2014 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103439-searching-for-mugash/?do=findComment&comment=1042656","commentId":1042656,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1397002211,"content":"I'm with Grandspleen on this one, you place the tokens on the location first, it is then fully explored so you search, reveal mugash and would then advance to Stage 3A."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103439-searching-for-mugash/?do=findComment&comment=1042772","commentId":1042772,"userName":"eli124","timestamp":1397010642,"content":"Here's the official ruling from Caleb: \n\n \n\nThe Forced effect on stage 2b triggers after “questing successfully” which actually occurs before any progress is placed. Placing progress is only done after determining whether or not the players have quested successfully. That’s why it goes on to say “cancel all progress that would be placed on this stage…” (emphasis added). Since the Searches X keyword only triggers when a location is explored (and that only happens after placing progress on it), it is not possible to bring Mugash into play and advance to stage 3a in the same quest phase (unless you use a player card effect to explore a location before resolving the quest)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103439-searching-for-mugash/?do=findComment&comment=1042862","commentId":1042862,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1397020003,"content":"gotcha, thanks for that response!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103439-searching-for-mugash/?do=findComment&comment=1042892","commentId":1042892,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1397023598,"content":"> I think it is like Hunt for Gollum\n\nExactly the scenario I was thinking of when I saw the wording on this card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103439-searching-for-mugash/?do=findComment&comment=1042894","commentId":1042894,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1397023672,"content":"...
