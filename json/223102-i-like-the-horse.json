It six that it requires you to have 2 enemies engaged with you (or the person you are defending for) in order to take advantage of the shadow cancellation and that you have to discard the shadows blindly (unless you're using a different card to see the shadows earlier).

Dori is quite good if you have readying, but as I only own one core set I have a limited access to UC. You could use two horses or a horse and a Ring Mail to make him a good defender (defend, ready, boost). I like decks which uses heroes for things they aren´t supposed to do, and I have a really bad deck with Grima, Dori and Arwen who uses Arwen (with LoV) and maybe Grima to quest, Dori and maybe Grima to defend and Arwen and maybe Dori to attack (Arwen uses some elven weapons). The idea is to pair Dori with a lore hero to give him \"access\" to a Burning Brand, but relying on Arwen to attack was a really bad idea. I think that deck needs a Glorfindel to work."}]}
