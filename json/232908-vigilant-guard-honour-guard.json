If I got this attachment on one of my hero and also Honour guard into play can i just take an undefended attack from, let's say, the balrog, activate vigilant guard to take one damage on my hero instead of the full damage and then cancel it with honour guard ?\n\nI am kind of puzzled by such combo, i might have missed something"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232908-vigilant-guard-honour-guard/?do=findComment&comment=2466772","commentId":2466772,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1476962511,"content":"I think you might have read Vigilant Guard incorrectly...?\n\nHere's what happens...\n\n* Undefended attack from the Balrog is going to hit for 8 damage\n\n* You assign that damage to a hero\n\n* You fire Vigilant Guard to siphon 1 damage to the attached hero. Now only 7 damage is going to the original hero you were assigning to.\n\n* Honour Guard cancels that 1 siphoned point of damage.\n\n* ...There's still that 7 damage that has to be placed on the originally chosen hero. Hope you have Citadel Plate!\n\nSince you could have just used Honour Guard on the initial damage assignment rather than the Vigilant Guard'ed damage, it doesn't help in this case."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232908-vigilant-guard-honour-guard/?do=findComment&comment=2467080","commentId":2467080,"userName":"Courchevel","timestamp":1476975408,"content":"Ok\n\nThanks Sappidus"}]}
