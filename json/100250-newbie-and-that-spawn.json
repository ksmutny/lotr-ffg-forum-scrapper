OR is the pretty little lady my \"choice\"?\n\nAnd while I have your attention, the planning stage is the only time you can play allies & attachments. Do I have that right.\n\nFascinating game.\n\nThanx in advance for your help.\n\nNow lets go questing!\n\ndizpatcher"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100250-newbie-and-that-spawn/?do=findComment&comment=998522","commentId":998522,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1393575304,"content":"Hi dizpatcher!\n\n \n\n1) You're allowed to choose ANY spider, so it doesn't have to be Ungoliant's Spawn. It makes sense though to choose the big ugly one, as you have to find and defeat her to win the game.\n\n \n\n2) You have that right about allies and attachments. Some cards like \"Sneak Attack\" allow you to play allies or attachments in other phases of the game, but they explicitely say so."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100250-newbie-and-that-spawn/?do=findComment&comment=1000676","commentId":1000676,"userName":"dizpatcher","timestamp":1393802698,"content":"thanx so much."}]}
