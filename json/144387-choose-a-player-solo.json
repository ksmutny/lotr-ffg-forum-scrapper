Otherwise a huge chunk of my card collection would be useless for solo play.\n\nÂ \n\nCheers"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/144387-choose-a-player-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1525881","commentId":1525881,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1428077501,"content":"Yes, you can choose yourself."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/144387-choose-a-player-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1526347","commentId":1526347,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1428101277,"content":"Thank you, i thought that and it mde sense, but wanted to know officially.
