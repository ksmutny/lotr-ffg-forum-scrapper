However, the attachment would have to be specific to Noldor I think, especially if it gave a resource because it would seem a little unfair if you could put an attachment like that on Grimbeorn who could trigger his ability and just get that resource back.

I actually don't think the Grimbeorn combo would be broken, per se. You still have to hold the original resource during the planning phase and while he does get the resource back, he is not ready by this attachment. He would need something else in order to trigger it again. Likewise, leadership Aragorn and Gimli benefit from this attachment but not in a broken way (just readying) Balin would finally get a little love. Frodo and Eomer would be a lot stronger. \n\nHonestly, the one that might break is Na'asiyah.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305367-hero-and-supporting-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3886553","commentId":3886553,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1580843504,"content":"As long as the attachment benefiting spending a resource exhausts to do so, I don't think it's game-breaking with either Grimbeorn or Na'asiyah."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305367-hero-and-supporting-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3886696","commentId":3886696,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1580851637,"content":"I think that spending a resource bonus is great, what I would also consider is:\n\n \n\nImmortality\n\nCost 1\n\nAttach to a Noldor or Silvan hero.\n\nAfter attached hero spends a resource from its resource pool to trigger an action or response effect, exhaust this card to ready attached hero.\n\n \n\nAs for the hoped for Eagle hero I actually hope it's Gwahir and we get Wilyador as an ally.

For essentially a base 3 cost (free in quad sphere) you would still have to guard it. Sting is a better option, as it is free for a hobbit hero (as opposed to noble), essentially has the same stat line boost out the gate and also has a nice trigger for attack/defense. \n\nI see what you are going for, though. It's a solid idea and I think they might do something like that anyway. I just think the cost is way too much upfront.\n\nAlso, would Saruman/Gandalf get a momentary +4 boost if you could finagle the noble stat on them and then trigger their ability? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305367-hero-and-supporting-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3886912","commentId":3886912,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1580872621,"content":"Remember that so far all the latest cycles have had at least 1 ffg created hero, so Wilyador actually fits the bill, though I kinda agree with General Grievous with wanting a Gwahir hero.\n\n \n\nI do think if they make an attachment for Gildor it should be specific to Noldor or Silvan...

Either way I am feeling Gwahir as a hero and then Wilyador being one of his available allies to round out then eagle trait. But either way an Eagle is along-requested option and favourite."}]}
