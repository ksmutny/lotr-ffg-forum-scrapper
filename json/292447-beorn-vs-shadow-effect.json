The only consequence would be that Beorn would not be able to act anymore for the round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292447-beorn-vs-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=3652098","commentId":3652098,"userName":"caribecards","timestamp":1553093376,"content":"> 9 hours ago, Alonewolf87 said:\n> \n> The declaration of the defender was already done, so even if a shadow effect exhausted the defending character that was still ready (or even blanked out the sentinel keyword if it was defending another player's enemy) the defense would still resolve normally.
