As pyschorocka pointed out spirit has a lot of options to make sure her ability triggers each round and it seems as though putting progress tokens on locations is the new design for the dunedain trait if this pack is any indication considering her, the greyflood wanderer, and aptly named warden of arnor all deal with location manipulation.\n\n \n\nRivendell Scout: Will be a great addition in secrecy decks since he will carry the fabulous cost of zero but other than that i dont think he would be used unless noldor gains universal buffs.  Interested to see the art although.\n\n \n\nFeigned Voice: So here is the final silvan returning event that we had not seen.  As with the other 3 previously spoiled this is another great card.  Having another 3 feints with the side ability of re-triggering Silvan buffs once replaying is really great and the trait gets better with each pack.  It will be immensely satisfying even to just return an exhausted ally you may have used for questing to stop an enemy you didnt anticpated engaging you from attacking then throwing out a new ally to attack that enemy with Celeborn's buff.\n\n \n\nRumil: previously spoiled but i'll look forward to incorporating him into decks.  I kind of wish his cost was 3 instead of 4 but whatever.\n\n \n\nElven Mail: holy crap is this card phenominal.  giving the sentinal trait alone is a big deal so you no longer necessarily have to count on pulling arwen to be able to multi-defend in multiplayer.  the obvious target for this is Elrohir as mentioned previously.  It seems the elf twins are getting a host of new toys to freshen up their gameplay this cycle which is pretty great.  Celeborn and Elrond are two decent targets for this as well.  Even Gildor is a good target since it doesnt specifically mention heroes since he has 3 defense but yea Elrohir all the way.\n\n \n\nGreyflood Wanderer: interesting ally who i like in theory but dont know if i'd use in practice.  kind of depends on the game situation and how many locations are in the staging area because in the end it comes down to \"is a threat gain of 2 worth X amount of progress tokens\" because otherwise his 3 cost his hard to justify his cost when there are other costly spirit allies that may otherwise be more deserving.  In a mono spirit deck (or heavily featured spirit deck) he would obviously work well with northern tracker but otherwise i think he may get the bump\n\n \n\nWarden of Arnor: I like the card even though its not terribly strong but the real limitation is that at this point it literally can only be attached to Idraen.  I'm sure FFG intends to create more scout traited heroes (and i think we may even see one in the following pack with the potential for a lore hero haldir) but still even then...its hard to really debate the use of this card. Either you're using Idraen and you may run 2 copies or you're not running Idraen and you're obviously not using it.\n\n \n\nMessage from Elrond: Maybe the more creative thinkers of this board can think of better uses for it than I, but currently this card seems like a dud...i just cant even see the point unless they need a gandalf for one reason or another. maybe the art will be god.\n\n \n\nNoiseless Movement & Leafbrooch: already spoiled and this post is long enough already"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111488-and-our-next-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=1166416","commentId":1166416,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1406089877,"content":"Man Elven Mail is like the exact card I've been hoping gets made for a while now, something that gives Sentinel AND defense/health and can go on Elrohir. He already has beasty defense, a ridiculous amount of readies provided you build up his resources but has always been weak against direct damage (especially shadow effects that deal direct damage) on his meager 4 hit points.\n\nI'm still in shock this actually got made and is coming out so soon. Fills one of the glaring weaknesses in my two handed decks so so well and now even if I do get Arwen out but she then dies I won't lose Sentinel on Elrohir provided he has one of these. On top of this If he has defense buffed high enough and has Sentinel from Elven Mail already Arwen can instead be used to buff another defender and give them Sentinel and +1 defense instead!\n\nA second one goes perfectly on Elrond, who is usually used for questing but if he has unexpected courage or is kept back as a defender he will have much more health to defend with and can defend for both decks. It also works very well on Gildor and Elladan."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111488-and-our-next-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=1166440","commentId":1166440,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1406091150,"content":"wow, that is a AWESOME hero.

A location never showed up for 7 rounds, so her ability was useless. I think she will be better in multiplayer where a location will be showing up regularly, but solo it's very unpredictable and tough to build a strategy around locations leaving play, unless it is scenario specific, but then there are usually not a lot of enemies to deal with.\n\nWith Imrahill it's easier to have allies leaving play, and you can design a deck to make it happen regularly to ensure he will be ready for combat. with Idrean there is no guarantee a location will even be in play, or that you will clear it before combat. Also locations will be cleared when there are no enemies in play which basically just wastes her action advantage. She'll need some other readying cards to ensure multiple uses out of her, otherwise her ability is going to be to random to count on when it matters most. It will probably only happen a few times a game.\n\nMaybe a card like wingfoot can help her out, but to bad it's lore. It's cool she is can become a pretty good defender with Blood of Numenor. Though increasing her attack with the tactics card Gondorian Fire would probably be more useful.\n\nOf course, I only tried her once but the forecast is looking bleak for solo play for my tastes.

Both of them get more powerful in multiplayer decks because they increase the odds of their response triggering. With Warden of Arnor and a Glorfindel+Asfaloth, any time a location with 3 or fewer progress is the first to be revealed that round, you can ready her.\n\n \n\nShe is inherently weaker than Imrahil in a way, though. Since her ability works best with locations, revealing locations is what is most likely to ready her. But with more locations being revealed, fewer enemies are revealed, and therefore her readying is less likely to be useful. With Prince Imrahil, an ally leaving play is often due to chump blocking, which means that there are enemies to be dealt with, so Imrahil now gets ready to do battle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111488-and-our-next-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=1167138","commentId":1167138,"userName":"divinityofnumber","timestamp":1406138872,"content":"Part of me feels like the 3 attack strength is just too much, given her ability.

Overall, I tend to feel like Spirit is the strongest sphere already, and giving it access to more characters that improve their combat abilities is only making the gap wider. In that sense, I totally agree with you.\n\nIf you put her in any other sphere she'd feel more balanced that way, but the trigger for her readying ability would feel out of place. Also, if her attack is lowered, she wouldn't have any \"good\" stats and her ability to ready would become weaker.\n\nOverall, I feel that she is fine the way she is. I don't particularly like that she gives the Spirit sphere more of an advantage, but I can deal with it.

Various combinations can ensue, which increases the replayability. The shadow and treacheries are fairly tame. The new Dunedain hero excels in this quest; bring Northern tracker, Asfaloth and Warden of Arnor for some on demand readying. We used generic decks for our first game and got beaten (but still almost won). On the second game we slightly tweaked our decks for the quest and won. Fun and includes lots of decision space on how to proceed from one trial to the next.\n\nMy player card rating: 9/10\nA very solid pack of cards, especially for secrecy decks. The new hero is a blast, think Aragorn-like stats and readying ability with Asfaloth/Glorfindel's or Legolas' help.

Her ability is limited by location exploration but this is forming a really cool deck. I am not ready to call it done (I finalize decks at the end of the cycle) but Lore / Spirit solo deck is showing GREAT promise.\n\n \n\nEspecially with Rivendale Scout.. Tracker, Guide, I.Tracker, etc... I think it is the start of a new encounter control deck where you leave the locations in the staging area and then use R.Scout to complete these locations at a time of your choosing. We have a lot of tools for placing exploration markers as well as moving them with R.Scout. Even ways to remove the threat of a location every quest phase so storing tokens on a location dose not add threat... It is kind of like when we used to run SNARE and IN FIGHTING to move damage around.\n\n \n\nI have a suspicion that this could be the start of a new \"type\" location entering and leaving play effects.. we already have a few, and she will be a major player in this forming deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111488-and-our-next-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=1175624","commentId":1175624,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1406687312,"content":"> I am not ready to call it done (I finalize decks at the end of the cycle) but Lore / Spirit solo deck is showing GREAT promise.\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n\n \n\nTo be completely honest I don't think they're gonna develop it further than this pack.

Here is a possible strategy that calls for some seldom used cards. Keep Thror's key attached to her until a location pops up with a nasty travel effect with lots of quest points between and between 1-3 threat. The threat choice will be based on how many Power of the Earth you have in hand.\n\nLet say you completely neutralize a location effect with Thor's key, then you eliminate its staging area threat with power in the earth. Now if you have some cards that can put progress on the location like Asfaloth each round, if the location has 6 quest points and you get 2 or ravenhill scouts in play you can pretty much clear a location the moment it shows up in the staging area, or wait until you need to ready Idraen for combat.\n\nThat sounds like a lot of moving parts, but could be pretty neat once it's all set up.\n\nEdited July 30, 2014 by Tracker1"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111488-and-our-next-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=1175886","commentId":1175886,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1406709047,"content":"I think the goal is to have a high point location as the travel area. Place travel markers on it with Guide. This way even if you fail to quest you still place progress tokens. Though the goal is to not ever clear it, just use it as a \"storage area\" for tokens which you move with R.Scout and Asfaloth, to drop 4 on a location on a whim. This is only a few cards.. 2 in fact, 3 with the Guide.\n\nI dunno, I think there is something missing still, but the basics of a interesting deck is there I think. Riddermark's Finest drops 2 tokens at will... as dose Strength of Will, Ride to Ruin (combo's with clandra). Remeber she untaps as a response, you could use clearing locations as a way to untap between combat. Untap her with Asfaloth by clearing the travels location then tap her again to drop Strength of Will as you travel, and then untap her again after that gose off, especially if there is a tracker out topping up all the locations in the staging so they only need a little thing to \"tip them over.\n\nStill yeah, I have no idea if this is worth it, but it feel like this could be a thing, though locations are getting more powerful and less often of late.. still I'm curious to see what the rest of the set gives us. I only really put effort into deck making after pack 6.\n\nEdited July 30, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111488-and-our-next-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=1175985","commentId":1175985,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1406716252,"content":"But if the active location is absorbing progress and then redistributing it, how do you make progress on the quest.

It keeps the staging area clean while readying Idraen often so that you have time to set up the rest of the deck. This only really works in quests where there is a stage that it doesn't hurt to progress slowly on. I also suggest Path of Need to go along with this strategy. If you can get it into play during this \"setup\" time, you can have several turns where none of your heroes exhaust to do anything while you build up your ally army. This seems quite powerful to me. Too bad you can only have 1 copy of Path of Need in your deck. Makes it less reliable... but that's what Master of the Forge is for, right?"}]}
