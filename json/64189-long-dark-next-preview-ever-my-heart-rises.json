Dáin gives each dwarf already an attack bonus of one and this guy basically does the same, only that he focuses the bonus attack points on himself. He has already 4 attack points from the start if you play with three dwarven heroes, and as I usually have around 5 or more dwarven allies around when I play… and he isn't even unique!\n\nThe Ring Mail is the card I like the most.

As you can imagine, i'm more than pleased with these three cards. I've found pure dwarf decks to be very difficult to run and more luck dependant than my other decks  (have far more luck with my rohan builds). I'm really looking forward to the next set. I doubt we'll get a dwarf hero… but that would be awesome too. Hoping for a Thorin or Balin in the hobbit pack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64189-long-dark-next-preview-ever-my-heart-rises/?do=findComment&comment=627930","commentId":627930,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1336494053,"content":"I share your affinity for Dwarves Captain Poe! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64189-long-dark-next-preview-ever-my-heart-rises/?do=findComment&comment=627991","commentId":627991,"userName":"Beano","timestamp":1336502747,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\nBohemond said:\n\n \n\nI don't like scenario dependent cards since I don't rebuild between games.  However, only one of the three cards is scenario dependent.  Erebor Battle Master is an unbelievable killing machine.  i can't wait to roll him out in my dwarf deck.\n\n \n\n \n\nI fear he might be too strong.

When teamed with Lore, it is easy to boost one of them to sufficient attack to kill almost anything. (A couple record keepers and a hammersmith and you are looking at an attack of 7! That is easily achievable third turn) Of course, getting attack strength is not necessarily game breaking since you still need to deal with the defense somehow. If this guy could attack the staging area then we would have a different story."}]}
