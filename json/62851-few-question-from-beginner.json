One\n\n2.) You don´t . Normally you explore it by putting progress tokens on it in the quest phase after quest resolution.\n\n3.) discard pile\n\n4.) nothing\n\n5.) You have to search for one spider.......so you can search for Ungoliant´s Spawn ( which is a spider) and put it into the stagging area.\n      So you don´t have to wait until it comes up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62851-few-question-from-beginner/?do=findComment&comment=615078","commentId":615078,"userName":"LuciusII","timestamp":1333893349,"content":" Ty. for answering I understand everything except answer on number 4.)!
