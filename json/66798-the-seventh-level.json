I just went to look at it's difficulty rating and am shocked it's a 3! Haha.\n\nI \"breezed\" through Into the Pit relatively unscathed and this quest took a lot of doing for me with many, many attempts. My heroes kept getting that darn treachery attachment, the Cave Troll seemed to come up like no other, and just swarms of enemies. I finally realized that this quest is all about getting allies out, and fast, which I was finally able to do this last game when I did finally beat it. I didn't change the number of allies, I simply cut down on a lot of the other attachments in my deck, and that seemed to work.\n\nJust curious to see others opinions! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66798-the-seventh-level/?do=findComment&comment=651834","commentId":651834,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1340994288,"content":"it is harder than what its level is, though funnily i found into pit much harder, one of the hardest yet"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66798-the-seventh-level/?do=findComment&comment=651873","commentId":651873,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1341003460,"content":" This might be the only quest where a tactics heavy deck really shines."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66798-the-seventh-level/?do=findComment&comment=651904","commentId":651904,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1341008660,"content":"oddly enough, just attempted the final quest of Khazad-Dum for the first time right now, and had no difficulty.

In coop game this quest most of the time easy like hell. But solo yes another story.\n\nThis one of my favorite quest cose you never know what can happen(special on the second stage) everything was ok and boom you surrounded gangs of goblins and overwhelmed. One of the rare quest in the game  which is always can surprise you and until the end you never know you win or lose(i mean only for solo game). Love it! Good work of designers. Anyway KD and second cycle is much better then first cycle and looks like hobbit will not dissapointed us too!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66798-the-seventh-level/?do=findComment&comment=652023","commentId":652023,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1341045966,"content":"Dain Ironfoot said:\n\noddly enough, just attempted the final quest of Khazad-Dum for the first time right now, and had no difficulty.

Seventh Level, however can overwhelm you very quickly with enemies. For me, it was the toughest one, as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66798-the-seventh-level/?do=findComment&comment=652087","commentId":652087,"userName":"bollywongaloid","timestamp":1341060948,"content":"Oddly, I've never had any trouble with Seventh level, but I always play 2 player so that's probly got a lot to do with it.preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]"}]}
