In the staging area were a Dol Guldur Packmaster and a Dol Guldur Orcs and Gladden Fields, we came out of the questing phase with 3 cards left in the encounter deck and only 3 progress tokens needed to finish the quest. My heroes were Aragorn, Legolas w/ Blade of Gondolin, and Gimli. My gf's heroes were Eowyn, Theodred and Thalin. Long story shorter, we were able to dispose of both creatures. And due to the Packmaster and Dol Guldur Orcs, they had depleted the encounter deck due to shadow card draw. Legolas killed and put 3 progress on the quest ending it. The quest flips to reveal Ambush on the Shore. No creatures were in play, and no cards in the encounter deck to flip into the staging area due to it being depleted and the encounter deck does not reshuffle until Questing Phase. So we won!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very strange ending to the Journey Down the Anduin."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45726-strange-ending/?do=findComment&comment=458633","commentId":458633,"userName":"DerBarchen","timestamp":1303704897,"content":"Hahaha, Epic Win!

On page 18 of the rule book.\n\n\" If the encounter deck runs out of cards , any enemies that have not been dealt shadow cards are not dealt shadow cards this round. An empty encounter deck only resets during the quest phase (see page 14).\"\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45726-strange-ending/?do=findComment&comment=458795","commentId":458795,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1303730611,"content":" That is an awesome win."}]}
