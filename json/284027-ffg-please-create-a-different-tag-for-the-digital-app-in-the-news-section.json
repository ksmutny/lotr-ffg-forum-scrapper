Aside from that the two games are distinctly different in how they play. I am also thinking that this confusion might discourage new players from discovering the paper game if they were first introduced to the digital one and didn't like it (see the mixed reviews on the steam page). \n\nWould it be too much to create a distinct tag for the digital app? It's a completely different game. "}]}
