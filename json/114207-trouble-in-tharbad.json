Lastly this is a quest that will make many people revisit (or try for the first time) secrecy.\n\nI like to read your thoughts and you opinion about it.

Glorfindel and Frodo assisted my new favorite heroine in beating the quest in 7 rounds. Despite my low starting threat, the encounter deck throws some pretty threat-heavy enemies and locations. My threat limit was lowered to 40, but it was never an issue in the game. In fact, the average questing deck will probably not have any problems with quest phase 1.\n\n \n\nIn phase 2, I had 4 total enemies in play and 2 locations total, despite taking on 1 enemy every round. Here threat management becomes an issue, as even 1 or 2 points can result in double engagements. Thanks to Emery and Arwen, I only lost one ally and then finished the phase in 2 turns after bringing in a Shipwright and a Northen Tracker back from the discard pile thanks to Caldara, then getting her back thanks to fortune or fate. Quite some time was spent in this phase going over engagement options and I could see it turning ugly quickly under other conditions. I never fought the nastiest enemies, Mellanarch's followers or whatever.\n\n \n\nAll in all I enjoyed *** thanks to its innovative approach to threat mechanics and the many options surrounding engagement checks and travelling options. Because a standard deck can beat it easily, I feel that its difficulty level is quite appropriate. It felt like a breath of fresh air. I plan on playing it again between harder and longer quests. \n\n \n\nKudos to FFG for introducing unconventional victory conditions in the latest packs.\n\n \n\nBy the way Caldara is awesome and I highly recommend playing her!\n\n \n\nEdit: looks like we cannot use acronyms for Trouble in Tharband without triggering the profanity filter. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nEdited August 22, 2014 by FetaCheese"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1220254","commentId":1220254,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1408754451,"content":"Played this twice, lost the first time using the ally free deck I was using on 3 trials, not enough questing power.

It took forever to make it through the first stage, but the second stage was cleared in 2 turns, so i found it a bit anti-climatic after the long struggle, at which point i thought i might lose many times.\n\nDid I like the quest? Somewhat. I'll have to try it some more, with some different decks. The time mechanic was a bit of a nuisance to keep track of especially since there are tons of effects to remove counters, and even i was very close to losing many times, i never felt very frightening like it does in other quest, because the real reason for losing was more associated with the threating out mechanic rather than with being beaten into the ground by the encounter deck, so that felt really different, and in some ways it was a bit boring.

Having the main mechanic be about lowering your threat through questing at stage 1 along while just about every difficult enemy in the encounter deck being above 30 engagement, makes the scenario quite simple for a deck that focuses on attacking the staging area. By the time stage 2 is reached it only takes a round or 2 to win.\n\nOverall, the scenario design is an interesting Idea, but the path to victory is so straight forward and predictable that I don't see getting much replay value out of it. That being said, i certainly do not mind this scenario every once in awhile.\n\nI have not tried to use secrecy cards and deck on this yet. It probably could work well since the scenario makes it so easy to achieve secrecy. Although, i'm shying away from it because it's kind of a false secrecy set up by the scenario, if i took the same deck and played it against another scenario with high expectations since it did well on the current scenario, i'd probably be in for a rude awakening. Personally I'd like secrecy to be a viable option on many scenarios, and not have to be given customized quests that allow me to play that type of deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1221355","commentId":1221355,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1408826885,"content":"My super-hero attachment deck lost its first game and then I switched to elves and destroyed the quest.  Finished 2B in one turn.\n\n \n\nI didn't do it, but I think A Watchful Peace and/or Shadow of the Past to recur Hidden Alleyway could be quite powerful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1223242","commentId":1223242,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1408932365,"content":"Won on our first attempt playing blind today.  2-player game with Haldir/Merry/Pippin(Lo) ranger deck on one side and Dunhere/Denethor/Glorfindel(Sp) questing deck (with Dunhere on the staging area) on the other.  \n\n \n\nIt took us awhile to build up enough questing power to start really getting our threat down, but the encounter deck did not build up momentum thanks to Haldir and Dunhere removing all threats and Glorfindel taking down locations here and there.  I think we got past stage 1 after about 6 rounds, but the time counter never went off thanks to some helpful locations adding counters and preventing them from being removed.\n\n \n\nWe finished the second stage in two rounds.  The last card revealed was Get that Dwarf!

(two handed)\n\nFirst attempt I was smashing it so far and had played a dunedain mark on haldir first turn and for the other deck a ranger spikes and light of valinor on glorfindel. Had a location and treachery (that I removed a time counter to counter the other effect) come out during staging. Engaged one of the spys from mordor and feinted it stopping its nasty time counter removal and then killed it with Legolas, Nalir and Elrohir clearing The Empty Mug thanks to Legolas. Haldir attacked the other spy using his ability and did 2 damage to it (and would have probably killed it the next turn) and I was ready for turn two. Finished planning and then had a marauder come out which had ranger spikes attached to it as it entered staging and then? GET THAT DWARF! Because the lore/spirit deck was the first player this resulted in the marauder attacking Nalir and Elrohir not being able to help out... it was either Nalir or Haldir for defense (quested with Elrond and Glorfindel).... either would have died easily and resulted in either loss or more or less a loss (I don't really play on when heroes die unless I'm pretty far into the quest already). Just got super unlucky I guess and hadn't established Sentinel yet on Elrohir with an Elven Mail or Arwens buff resulting in an easy defeat due to Nalir getting destroyed by that nasty Marauder!\n\n \n\nSecond attempt I smashed it although was stuck on stage 1 for a fair while and had my threat limit reduced to 30 and was somewhat worried it would reduce to 20 as I started to get minorly location swarmed (even with asfaloth out) and was barely reducing threat anymore. Stayed between 9-15 threat on both decks for a few turns and managed to eventually quest hard over a round or two and finally get to zero (only 2 counters left on the quest stage at this point narrowly avoiding a 20 threat limit) and got to stage 2. Smashed stage 2 over three turns and only had the time effect trigger once (thanks to an Orc Scout, or whatever the one that reduces a time counter or reveals another card is called, removing a time counter) and was easily able to kill all enemies except for Bellach (only because on no turns could I kill him outright, one turn I could put him down to a single hitpoint, so instead I killed all other enemies and ignored him) who I feinted twice and more or less ignored.\n\nWas pretty fun but going to give it another go and try to get through stage 1 a little faster."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1249369","commentId":1249369,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1409908580,"content":"Local dealer just contacted me.

Also, as you can see, Gandalf is used as a hero, and not even as a part of overly strong \"Gandalf Eagle Deck\", so leadershit player couldn't sneak attack him and stuff.\n\n \n\n \n\nOk, down to the business. With 4 players, this quest is really brutal, or so it seemed to us. At the beginning of the game, you have 4 enemies each of which will remove 1 time token on attack... \"whats the problem?!\", you'll say, \"just don't engage them, their threat cost is 40 for crying out loud!\", you'll continue. I'll tell you what's the problem: questing. If you'll be lucky and no engage cost lowering effect pops during first quest round, you'll face a dilemma: engage those spies this turn and suffer the loss of -10 threat out threshold OR keep that 8 threat in the staging area and suffer the same loss later. Fortunately, we revealed only 1 enemy during the first quest and he fell right into my trap, so he was no problem... for now. Other 3 cards were 2 locations and a treachery which forced us to remove 1 time token (because the other effect was A LOT of threat). I was forced to use the lore event to nullify the threat of one of the locations, so we could explore Empty Mug turn 1. Then, we travelled the Streets, engaging every spy with each of us right after. And like that, first round our threat threshold dropped to 40. We managed to kill 3 out of 4 spies the same combat phase, thanks to our strong and potent heroes. And that was just the first turn. Each turn the encounter deck did it best at hasteful time counter removing, we were walking at the brink of existance, barely lowering out threat in time before threat out threshold falls once more. In the end we won, bot GOD it was a tense and close game. To anyone considering this quest as an easy pie - I encourage you to try it with as many players you can muster. Not to tell how thematic it is - trying to hide from everlasting pursuit, entering hideout to catch a breath, brigands retreating to the roofs and patiently waiting to counter attack, Bellach getting lost in the encounter deck but slowly cathing up on us... there is so much theme in this quest. \n\n \n\nFunny fact: I used Loragorn's ability to drop myself from 36 to 31 on the turn one to prevent myself from threating out at 40 on the next turn (threshold was already lowered once)... Now that I think of it, I probably had to discard Aragorn because of Empty Mug's victory display effect?.. LOL!\n\n \n\nAlso, remember that Orc who got into my trap? We thought we were rid of him... then Get That Dwarf! Showed up, and it so happened that for that time this Orc had the highest Attack value :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\nAlso, Haldir was a total beast. These times when I was left alone, he easily made a -1 enemy before it even could attack. Leadershit player imbued him with this +1 Attack Dunedain thingy, while Tactics player gracefully granted Haldir both Dagger of Westernesse and Rivendell Blade.\n\nEdited November 2, 2014 by MyNeighbourTrololo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1373689","commentId":1373689,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1419049669,"content":"Just to make sure I get this right\n\n \n\nNalir causes you to raise your threat by 1 for each player, and then you have to raise it for the refresh phase also, right?\n\n \n\nSo when playing solo you raise your threat by 2 on each turn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1373694","commentId":1373694,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1419049764,"content":"Correct!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1373750","commentId":1373750,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1419052637,"content":"And another question (stupid really, but my mind is blocked)\n\n \n\n\"The first player either removes 1 time counter or each enemy get -20 engagement and +1 att \"\n\n \n\nThere are no enemies in game, thus I am obliged to remove teh time counter, right ?  :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]\n\n \n\nAnd a rule question, but it has to do with Bellach\n\n \n\nI have a ranger spikes in staging area, unnatached.

If it is just during the staging phase both ranger spikes will attach to the same first enemy revealed and not others revealed after it. I have only ever played more than one at a time in the troll quests and it seems like the only real reason to play more than once at a time is if you know that multiple enemies are going to enter the staging area at the same time like in the cases of the troll quests.\n\nEdited December 20, 2014 by PsychoRocka"}]}
