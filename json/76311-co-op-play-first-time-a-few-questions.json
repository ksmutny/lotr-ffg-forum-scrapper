Player 1 had Eleanor, Player 2 had the higher threat.\n\nWould Eleanor's ability only apply to \"When Revelead\" cards that would affect her player?\n\nI ran into a few other instances like this and since this is my first game not solo, I needed to ask.\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76311-co-op-play-first-time-a-few-questions/?do=findComment&comment=739743","commentId":739743,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1356688861,"content":"Yes.
