Win hands and use the cards you’ve won to deal damage to opponents, or heal allies and help them with extra cards. Each character assigns cards differently, so use your skills wisely! Fight the forces of evil as Gandalf, Thorin, or Bilbo, or smash the hopes of the heroes as Smaug or Bolg, the goblin leader.\n\nThe Hobbit Card Game includes:\n\n1 Rulesheet\n65 Cards\nThis standalone card game is not associated with the LCG The Lord of the Rings: The Card…\n\n \n\nSo there we are!
