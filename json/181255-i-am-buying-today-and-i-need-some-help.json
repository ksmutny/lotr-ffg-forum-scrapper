I play with a group of friends that play RPGs a lot, full decks are going to be important. (None of us have started collecting LoR the card game)\n\n \n\nSo, after the core sets I have about $60 left over to spend. What else should I get?

I would suggest going for the Lord of the Rings Saga boxes starting with Black Riders, as they provide great quests and good player cards in each one."}]}
