The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular scenario with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].\n\nWill you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular scenario under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament, feel free to post them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].\n\nAnd now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!\n\nSolo Player Tournament #9:\n\nScenario: Journey Down the Anduin\nDeck Parameters: 1-3 CS + all SoM APs\nTournament Mechanics: Sets of 3*\nNumber of Players: Solo Player\n\n*Sets of 3:\n1) A valid result in this tournament consists of reporting your results (wins and losses) from 3 back-to-back games, using the same deck for each of those 3 games. (Please observe the mulligan rule, and all other rules, from the LOTR LCG rulebook and subsequent official FAQ documents.)\n2) After you post your results, the results from your 3 games will be calibrated using the RGun formula** to obtain your Weighted Result.\n3) Weighted Results will then be ranked against other player’s Weighted Results in the Top Ten for this week’s tournament.\n4) You may play and report as many games (in Sets of 3) as you would like (so you can try out different deck builds over the week).\n5) Toward the end of the week, feedback about your game-play experience (playing in Sets of 3) will be received with enthusiasm.\n\n**The RGun formula has been designed to value both Final Score (per game) and overall Win Ratio (from your 3 games, cumulative). The formula is: (Average Score of Games Won) x (Total Games Played/Games Won). For an expanded discussion on how this formula was created, you can read the thread called Measuring Success [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=606341].\n\nTop Ten:\n\n1. meumakan ~ 73 (Frodo, Beravor, Théodred)\n2. plueschi ~ 82.33 (Éowyn, Beravor, Théodred)\n3. juicebox ~ 116.66 (Éowyn, Glóin, Beravor)\n4. leptokurt ~ 124.66 (Théodred, Frodo, Bilbo)\n5.

For some reason, I kept struggling against the scenario. I was always trying to find either my Gandalf or my Forest Snare. I decided to try Mirkwood Runner against this scenario because I was counting on Snaring a number of enemies (all the baddies with victory values). It turned out I had too many 3 cost allies... Longbeard Map-Maker should have been replaced by the 3rd Hammersmith and maybe Miners of the Hills (even if there are no conditions to get rid of).\n\nIn game 1, I got my first Gandalf via a last chance draw from Gleowine when I was at 49 threat in combat.\n\nGame # 2 was similar: I fought back the Troll with Denethor, A Burning Brand, Dunedain Warning and Daughter of the Nimrodel for at least 5 turns before getting a Forest Snare and finally getting a chance at hitting him. I drew my whole deck, but only managed to play 3 Gandalf in all because they came so late in the game...\n\nGame # 3 was a total disaster from the start. Starting hand was 2 Steward of Gondor, 2 Sneak Attack, Henamarth Riversong and Gildor Inglorion. I figured it was worth a try; as soon as I got my Song of Kings, I'd be in business (Gildor would then help me find the elusive Gandalf). But then the encounter deck revealed Pursued by Shadow during setup so my starting 27 threat became 30. I drew Erebor Hammersmith and Daughter of the Nimrodel on turn 1. I figured I still had a chance; with some luck, the Hammersmith would block and I'd get a Forest Snare to play on turn 2. I quested only with Bilbo: guess who got revealed? Dol Guldur Orcs... I so hate it not having A Test of Will... I scooped right there.\n\nI'll try to give it another shot with a Dwarven fighting deck (although not having access to KD could make it not much more successfull)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60043-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-9-february-5-11-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=592209","commentId":592209,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1328799832,"content":"Card Pool: 1 Core Set\nHeroes: Éowyn (9), Dúnhere (8), Thanlin (8) [26 total starting threat]\nDeck:\n\nNEUTRAL\nGandalf 3x\n\nTACTICS\nDwarven Axe 2x\nBlade of Gondolin 2x\nHorn of Gondor 1x\nGondorian Spearman 3x\nVeteran Axehand 3x\nBlade Mastery 3x\nFeint 2x\nQuick Strike 2x\nSwift Strike 1x\nStand Together 1x\n\nSPIRIT\nUnexpected Courage 1x\nFavor of the Lady 2x\nPower in the Earth 2x\nGaladhrim's Greetings 2x\nDwarven Tomb 1x\nWill of the West 2x\nStrength of Will 2x\nStand and Fight 3x\nA Test of Will 2x\nA Light in the Dark 2x\nHasty Stroke 2x\nFortune or Fate 1x\nLórien Guide 3x\nWandering Took 2x\nNorthern Tracker 2x\n\nGame 1 (win)\nFinal Threat: 29\nThreat of Dead Heroes: 0\nDamage on Heroes: 4\nVictory Points: 7 (Hill Troll and Gladden Fields)\nRounds completed: 13\nTOTAL: 156\n\nGame 2: loss\n\nGame 3: loss\n\nBoth lost games were due to bad threat control compounded by Evil Storm which killed Éowyn and Thalin both times.

And I had roughly 20 cards in hand.\n\nSo I play Protector of Lorien on Eowyn and go to the quest phase.\n\nI send everybody except Theodred questing.\n\nBanks of the Anduin get revealed and I respond with Strider's Path making it the active location.\n\nI now play Shadows of the Past and put Driven by Shadow on top of the encounter deck.\n\nI then sneak in Gandalf to kill the Hill Troll and proceed to stage 2\n\nI discard a good dozen cards to clear the Banks of the Anduin (going on top of the encounter deck) and stage 2 in one go.\n\nI reveal stage 3 and turn over Banks of the Anduin and Driven by Shadow. Since 1 enemy is still in play Driven by Shadow doesn't surge and all I have to do is kill the beastmaster.\n\nSo Gandalf sneaks again dealing 4 damage and defending the Orc, while Theodred attacked for the final damage.\n\nUnfortunately the Beastmaster had a little surprise and a Wolf Rider went to attack, he had to go undefended and did his 2 damage.

I don't expect to get another one in before the end as I want to try the other tournament.\n\nI went with a Dwarven Lore deck.\n\nResults:\n\nGame # 1 - Win: 31 threat + 9 dead hero + 0 wound - 13 victory points + (14 rounds * 10) = 167\n\nGame # 2 - Win: 29 threat + 0 dead hero + 0 wound - 8 victory points + (8 rounds * 10) = 101\n\nGame # 3 - Win: 34 threat + 0 dead hero + 0 wound - 20 victory points + (13 rounds * 10) = 144\n\nDecklist:\n\nHero (3)\nDain Ironfoot (RtM) x1\nGloin (Core) x1\nBilbo Baggins (THFG) x1\n\nAlly (25)\nBrok Ironfist (Core) x1\nDaughter of the Nimrodel (Core) x1\nErebor Hammersmith (Core) x3\nFaramir (Core) x2\nGandalf (Core) x3\nGildor Inglorion (THoEM) x1\nGleowine (Core) x2\nHaldir of Lorien (AJtR) x1\nHenamarth Riversong (Core) x3\nLongbeard Map-Maker (CatC) x2\nLongbeard Orc Slayer (Core) x2\nMiner of the Iron Hills (Core) x2\nRivendell Minstrel (THFG) x2\n\nAttachment (17)\nA Burning Brand (CatC) x1\nFast Hitch (TDM) x3\nForest Snare (Core) x3\nProtector of Lorien (Core) x2\nSelf Preservation (Core) x2\nSong of Kings (THFG) x1\nSong of Wisdom (CatC) x1\nSteward of Gondor (Core) x3\nDunedain Warning (CatC) x1\n\nEvent (8)\nGrim Resolve (Core) x2\nSneak Attack (Core) x3\nStrider's Path (THFG) x3\n\nNothing much to say. The plan was to get either a Forest Snare or Gandalf to deal with the Troll over the first 2 turns.\n\nI lost Bilbo in game one when I let through an undefended Eastern Crow attack (hoping to get an easy resource off Gloin) and he got Dol Guldur Orcs as its shadow card. I chose to let go of Bilbo since I had Steward of Gondor and Song of Wisdom on Gloin already and I needed Dain Ironfoot to keep giving willpower to my dwarven army. Faramir proved to be a key in all games, allowing me to get the extra push needed to get through the staging area (especialy in game 3, where I had 4 locations in staging at some point during the 2nd part of the quest)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60043-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-9-february-5-11-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=593003","commentId":593003,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1328961240,"content":"I had a second cycle this morning which was more successful than the last:\n\n \n\ngame 1: WIN (116)\n\nthreat: 24\n\ndamage: 0\n\nfallen:\n\nrounds: 100\n\nvictory points: 8\n\n \n\ngame 2: WIN (137)\n\nthreat: 22\n\ndamage: 0\n\nfallen:\n\nrounds: 130\n\nvictory points: 15\n\n \n\ngame 1: WIN (121)\n\nthreat: 32\n\ndamage: 0\n\nfallen:\n\nrounds: 100\n\nvictory points: 11\n\n \n\nGames 2 and 3 saw two Hill Trolls.

At this time, I'd like to invite expanded discussion on this topic. Especially as you imagine how it might compare to the experience of playing Sets of 4 or 5."}]}
