After submitting the scores, I tried to see the Summary, just to check if everything was ok, but I haven't found any entry. All quests are marked as \"incompleted\". Probably I've done something wrong, but I can't find out what. Anyone of you can help me?\n\n\nThanks a lot\n\n\nJULIA"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56628-quest-log-help-needed/?do=findComment&comment=558863","commentId":558863,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1321962850,"content":"I'm not sure what would cause that.  The summary shows 0 quests successfully completed?  \n\nWhat date did you enter for your logged quests?  If it was before November, those quests won't show up on the Summary page, because that is when the scoring system was changed.  \n\nYou can also check the quests you've already logged by going to the Log Quest page and scrolling down to the bottom.  It should show all quests you've entered.  There is an edit option in the bottom-right corner of each quest.  You can edit them and see if you forgot to enter something."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56628-quest-log-help-needed/?do=findComment&comment=558875","commentId":558875,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1321964535,"content":"Hi Kiwina,\n\nthank you for your answer. Yes, the Summary shows 0 Quests completed. I tried to re-enter the data, but nothing changed.\n\nOk for the score, the games I logged were played in June, so I can accept there is no score, but anyway, why no games are logged? The Log Quest is empty\n\nOUCH. Sorry. I had to ask for the quests before November, the 1st. I just noticed now the lik on the bottom of the page.\n\nSorry sorry sorry ::ashamed::"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56628-quest-log-help-needed/?do=findComment&comment=558949","commentId":558949,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1321972810,"content":"Still stalking me from game to game I see Julia gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56628-quest-log-help-needed/?do=findComment&comment=559053","commentId":559053,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1321986007,"content":"Dam said:\n\nStill stalking me from game to game I see Julia gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] ?\n\n\n\nOr maybe are you simply ubiquitous? ::laughter::"}]}
