Then follow the 4 steps under Phase 6 \"Combat\" in the rules. Any shadow cards dealt to the attacking enemy are discarded after the attack resolves.\n\n \n\nSo you can play actions inside the 4 steps of combat phase.\n\n \n\nSo, for example, yesterday i was playing with Bard, he was ready when in quest phase Haradrim Elite was revealed. After it dealt a shadow card, i played Hands Upon the Bow [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/shadow-and-flame/hands-upon-the-bow-saf], and i killed Elite before it attacked.

Let me look at this from 2 perspectives.\n\n1. Agree\n\n * The card just says to declare an attack, so it is just an attack against an enemy in the staging area. No reason to see this as a ranged attack.\n\n2. Disagree\n\n * You need to declare a character with ranged. (It already starts leaning towards something where you need ranged for) \n * The card is named \"hands upon the bow\": So I'm preparing my bow to shoot at someone, but I will hit him in a way where I didn't shoot the arrow? Or did I just fire the arrow but this is not considered to be a ranged attack? According to any theme this makes no sense at all.\n    \n * But what about Dunhere and Haldir?\n   \n   - Dunhere: He's a horse-rider, a men of the West-fold, they have spears and such. Of course would it be able to attack enemies from some distance away.\n   -Haldir: He's a ranger (and a scout), he knows how to hide. He can sneak towards enemies without them expecting anything and slit their throat. \n   \n   Theme wise it isn't that strange that these guys don't make ranged attacks during their actions.\n   \n   One funny down-side to this approach (for theme speaking)\n   \n   tn_vassal-of-the-windlord-tdm.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/tn_vassal-of-the-windlord-tdm.jpg]\n\nHow would he hold that bow ??\n\n \n\n \n\nFor now adapting my plays accordingly, but hope that something gets revised on this because I think it absolutely makes no sense that a card called \"Hands upon the Bow\" doesn't imply a ranged attack....\n\n \n\nGrtz, \nJban\n \n\nEdited September 7, 2014 by Jban"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91789-events-while-haradrim-elite-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=1252967","commentId":1252967,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1410141185,"content":"Yeah, agree, it's a case where theme and rules clash.  They simply could have written \"make a ranged attack,\" but for whatever reason opted not to.  It is what it is, certainly not worth an errata in my opinion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91789-events-while-haradrim-elite-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=1255224","commentId":1255224,"userName":"M0ng0","timestamp":1410274628,"content":"The encounter card says they attack from the staging area - so isnt Mndela correct by being able to use \"hands apon the bow\" to kill them ?\n\notherwise card would just say they make an immediate attack ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91789-events-while-haradrim-elite-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=1255733","commentId":1255733,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1410297010,"content":"Yeah, that was settled... in October 2013! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Bit of threadcromancy going on here, gotta read all the posts and check the date."}]}
