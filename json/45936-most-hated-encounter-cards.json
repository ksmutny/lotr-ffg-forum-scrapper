Another shadow effect that often caused problems for me is the one where you have to return an ally card to your hand.\n\nI also don't enjoy getting caught in a web. Among the enemies the worgs are really annoying since they keep running back to the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45936-most-hated-encounter-cards/?do=findComment&comment=460812","commentId":460812,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1304033452,"content":"Haven't any of you guys met the Hill Troll? If not, you are in for a treat. \n\nI agree with Hummerhorns, though. I had it in the staging area today, just waiting. It took a desperate maneuver, exhausting Gleowine, drawing and playing Wealth of Lorien, drawing Gandalf and playing him via Sneak Attack and then hitting with his damage to erase Hummerhorns. Otherwise, I would have lost my second hero. \n\nHonorable mention goes to The Necromancer's Reach."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45936-most-hated-encounter-cards/?do=findComment&comment=460843","commentId":460843,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1304043539,"content":"Titan said:\n\nHaven't any of you guys met the Hill Troll?

This means you've planned for encountering them probably as early as when you've built your deck and chose your heroes.

Most cards that may or may not show up, don't bother me as much. It's the one royal pain in the rear end that can't be avoided that frustrates me. But as you say, it is easier to prepare for them.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45936-most-hated-encounter-cards/?do=findComment&comment=461179","commentId":461179,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1304096465,"content":"I absolutely hate Caught in a Web!
