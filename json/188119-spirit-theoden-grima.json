You pay 0 resources, but you are consuming your -2 cost reduction every turn that could be spent on something else. For example two West Road Travellers give the same willpower and will stick around every turn, freeing up your cost reduction for other things."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188119-spirit-theoden-grima/?do=findComment&comment=1790573","commentId":1790573,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1442074126,"content":"The first half of my solo saga I played with Grima, Theoden, and Merry.

Which third hero do you use in Grima with Theoden?\n\n \n\nGalandriel!\n\n \n\nUse her in early game to counter Grima's threat gain and draw Therugrim and Nenya. Use Nenya for early questing and once you have established your board, exhaust Galadriel during the combat phase to buff Theoden. He may now attack for +6 ((edit: Nenya is a quest action so this won't work :/ )). Meanwhile you have effectively 6 resources to spend each round (3+1 from Keys of Orthanc+2 cost reduction). All for 30 threat! Drop Escorts from Edoras and ally Hamma in and out at will and get them back with Gamling. Stick Snowmane and a couple copies of Unexpected Courage in there along with mirror of Galandirel to get the Gamling Party up ASAP.\n\n \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n \n\nEdit:\n\n \n\nHere's an untested list:\n\n \n\nGaladriel\n\nGríma\n\nThéoden\n\n \n\n25 Allies\n\n \n\n2x [Escort from Edoras]\n\n3x [Gamling]\n\n3x [Háma]\n\n3x [West Road Traveller]\n\n3x [Westfold Horse-Breaker]\n\n2x [Westfold Horse-breeder]\n\n2x [Gléowine]\n\n2x [Quickbeam]\n\n2x [Warden of Healing]\n\n3x [Gandalf]\n\n \n\n15 Attachments\n\n \n\n3x [Ancient Mathom]\n\n2x [Herugrim]\n\n3x [Mirror of Galadriel]\n\n1x [snowmane]\n\n3x [Keys of Orthanc]\n\n3x [Nenya]\n\n \n\n10 Events\n\n \n\n3x [A Test of Will]\n\n1x [Dwarven Tomb]\n\n3x [Elrond's Counsel]\n\n3x [Daeron's Runes]\n\n \n\n \n\nMaybe take out 1 copy of Hamma or Gamling and squeeze in 2 UC in there.\n\nEdited September 16, 2015 by FetaCheese"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188119-spirit-theoden-grima/?do=findComment&comment=1798630","commentId":1798630,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1442404535,"content":"> exhaust Galadriel during the combat phase to buff Theoden.
