That said, if I recall correctly Celeborn was a Sindarin, which may be related but it's definately not the same as Silvan elves. Many silvan elves were ruled by Sindar elves (like Thranduil and Legolas) so it seems they're just repeating the process of naming such characters like Legolas and Celeborn Silvan for economic purposes and because that's the people they ruled. Not something I would have agreed about, but that's just ffg.

Since the main Sindar characters we get to know in LOTR seem to all lead Silvan Elves, it makes sense that they would share the trait.

What eagles will we get? Will we get non-tactics eagles?\n> \n> What do you think?\n\nI think it would definitely be cool if the eagles expanded out of the Tactics sphere.  In my opinion, Spirit seems like a good fit for them.  In The Hobbit, the eagles save the day by rescuing the Company of Thorin from the wild wargs and then proceed to fly them to safety.  Eagles already bolster some serious attack power with their presence in Tactics; so now I'd like to see them represented more as saviors (Landroval [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/51223bd0-ffd1-11df-a976-0801203c9004]already has a great hero saving ability; more effects like his is what I'm thinking.)  Perhaps location management could be a new eagle role as well since they are capable of flying great distances.  These are just a few ideas I have, but in reality it might make eagles too powerful.  Even where they stand now, though, I greatly enjoy making eagle decks, but they more or less serve one role since they're only present in the Tactics sphere.  \n\n \n\nAnd straying a little off topic here (but still on the note of birds of MIddle-earth,) I was really bummed that the On the Doorstep Saga Expansion did not include an ally card of Roac the Raven [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Ro%C3%A4c], who aids the Company of Thorin in the novel.  Though we did get the Ravens of the Mountain [http://hallofbeorn.com/HallOfBeorn_deploy/Cards/Search?Query=ravens&CardType=None&CardSet=Any&Trait=Any&Keyword=Any&Cost=-1&Sphere=None&Unique=False&Sort=None] Lore card, we didn't get the old bird himself, so I'd love to see him pop up somewhere even if it is exceedingly unlikely now!  I'm a bit partial to birds, though, so I'd be happy to see any new ones show up in the game... and yes, even the deadly Craven Eagle [http://hallofbeorn.com/HallOfBeorn_deploy/Cards/Details/fd89bdbf-7475-4f3e-96fc-8f5315a93074]!\n\nEdited January 9, 2014 by Karlson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=950172","commentId":950172,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1389298752,"content":"> MEC26-card-fan.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-ringmaker/MEC26-card-fan.png]\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> Look at that Boar Clan Stalker.

Rohan Warhorse was a nice addition, but being restricted makes it painful to use because you lose the ability to hold another weapon.
