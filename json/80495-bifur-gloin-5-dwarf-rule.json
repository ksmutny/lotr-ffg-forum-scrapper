What is the sequence of events here -- that is, I imagine that you canNOT trigger their Response in this situation, but when does their Response text become active and when does the opportunity to trigger it expire?\n\nAnd the response:\n\nBifur and Gloin count towards the number of dwarf characters you control when triggering their Response abilities because they have to enter play before they can trigger. As soon as they enter play, you control them.\n\nCheers,\n\nCaleb\n\n------\n\nIn other words, at the time that the Response text becomes active, you control 5 dwarves (counting Bifur or Gloin).  Thus trigginer the Response is a legal play.  At least, that is how I am reading this ruling.  What do you think?\n\n-GS\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80495-bifur-gloin-5-dwarf-rule/?do=findComment&comment=774022","commentId":774022,"userName":"bollywongaloid","timestamp":1363322868,"content":"GrandSpleen said:\n\nBifur and Gloin count towards the number of dwarf characters you control when triggering their Response abilities because they have to enter play before they can trigger.

If I'm ever in doubt of the rules I tend to go for the harder option as that generally seems to be the case most of the time. Not that I'm complaining… gloin and bifur are gonna be even handier in a Bombur deck now I know this - especially at the start of the game to accelerate your deck early"}]}
