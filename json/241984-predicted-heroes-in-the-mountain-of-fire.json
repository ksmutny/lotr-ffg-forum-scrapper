Anyone else want to predict which heroes we'll see in that box?\n\nI suspect that we'll see a Leadership and a Tactics hero, along with a new Fellowship Ringbearer and Fellowship Aragorn. A Leadership and Tactics hero would round out the distribution of heroes among the four main spheres (so far in the saga boxes, we've gotten 2 Leadership heroes, 2 Tactics heroes, 3 Spirit heroes, and 3 Lore heroes). We've also gotten 1 Neutral hero, 3 copies of Fellowship Frodo, and 2 copies of Fellowship Aragorn.\n\nMy guess right now is that we'll see:\n\n * Leadership Frodo\n * Tactics Gwaihir\n * Fellowship Sam (Ringbearer)\n * Fellowship Aragorn (maybe w/ Gondor trait?)\n\nAnyone else want to speculate?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241984-predicted-heroes-in-the-mountain-of-fire/?do=findComment&comment=2628298","commentId":2628298,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1486420333,"content":"Spirit Eomer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241984-predicted-heroes-in-the-mountain-of-fire/?do=findComment&comment=2628354","commentId":2628354,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1486422437,"content":"> 3 hours ago, Network57 said:\n> \n> Spirit Eomer\n\nThat's the perfect hero for an AP.\n\n \n\nAs for the last saga, Fellowship Sam is pretty much the only I would place a big bet on."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241984-predicted-heroes-in-the-mountain-of-fire/?do=findComment&comment=2628359","commentId":2628359,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1486422599,"content":"Fellowship Sam is a must in my opinion. He (briefly) was a ringbearer and that should be retained as a Card.\n\nI agree with Fellowship Aragorn, too as there would be Need for him and a Fellowship-ringbearer the way I imagine the quests.\n\nLeadership Frodo also would be a good bet in my book, if not for one Problem (see below). It fits the final parts of the Story and his other \"real\" hero Version is very old (and he's quite an impotant character). To stay in line with the established Hobbit mechanics (which either use threat as a ressource like Spirit pippin, faty or frodo or benefit you for staying under 20) I'd say he would cause some Kind of buff (maybe depending on the amount of other Hobbit heroes) while you are under 20 or will help you stay there.\n\nOnly Problem: You probably aren't allowed to run Frodo outside of his ringbearer form (if at all) and I doubt FFG would put a hero in a box you can't use it in, so I will go with Leadership EOMER, as he becomes the new leader of Rohan.\n\nFor the last hero I am really clueless. I doubt an eagle will ever be a hero and out of pure despair I go with tactics Pippin :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png].
