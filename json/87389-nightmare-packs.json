I had to call up a local game store and ask them to special order me a copy of the Game Night Kits Season 1 and 2 (those Nightmare decks are evil btw, wow! :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png] ). Since Season 2 is up, Season 1 should be avaible soon for print on demand I imagine. But that would mean copies floating about might be hard to come by as of this moment. My copy of season 1 was previously opened by the store (luckily the store never used it, even though they had intentions to do so, so it was mint condition anyhow). So, my advise, call your local game stores if they have some in stock."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87389-nightmare-packs/?do=findComment&comment=826307","commentId":826307,"userName":"Sprenger","timestamp":1375159054,"content":"There was a couple auctions for Season 2 Quests on Ebay last night. I attempted to pick them up but $20 for each quest that only contains 20 cards each was too rich for my blood. It would have been nice to pick up just one just so I could show my friends how crazy they are. \n\n \n\nAs for the actual topic, I wish FFG would just announce when they will be available. The crazy part is that it is Print of Demand. Seems like it shouldn't be difficult to make these available right now. I don't know. I just want more LOTR LCG!  \n\nEdited July 30, 2013 by Sprenger"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87389-nightmare-packs/?do=findComment&comment=826369","commentId":826369,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1375168196,"content":"Yes you can buy it around 60$.
