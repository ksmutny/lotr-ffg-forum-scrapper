So good, unless you play a mono leadership deck solo maybe.\n\n \n\nTactics: Hard to pick one, but I think I'll have to go with Black Arrow. Limited 1 per deck, when this epic card pops up I always get giddy and want to nuke something.\n\n \n\nSpirit: A test of will. This might sound like a dull choice. But I always get a satisfied feeling when I just cancelled a devastating threachery card.\n\n \n\nLore: Daeron's Runes. This card is always a welcome sight when you draw it. 0 cost, draw 2, dump 1? Yes please. Love the \"gamble\" effect in it, if you discard a card you can also use, but really need that other card.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd out of these 4, it would be Daeron's runes, hands down."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1903443","commentId":1903443,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1448190864,"content":"I by default assume that heroes are excluded from the list\n\n \n\nLeadship: Orthanc Guard. 2def/hp for 2 most cheap resources of the game makes me include him in every deck that has Leadership in it. \n\nLore: Ranger Spikes. Anything that prevents enemy from beating the snot out of me and is also keeps him at low threat is simply a must have.\n\nSpirit: Light the Beacons. This card is a game ender in multiplayer.\n\nTactics: Rumil. Good stats, has willpower, has ranged, hurts people. Well-worth the munah you pay for him, especially playing the artillery deck.\n\nNeutral: White Tower Watchman. For 3 neutral resources, he is good even if you're not running monosphere. If you do, however, he is great."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1903487","commentId":1903487,"userName":"caelenvasius","timestamp":1448196926,"content":"I have a really hard time picking just one, since each sphere has great cards, so I'll pick as fw as possible and put them here.\n\n \n\nLeadership:\n\n * Warden of Helm's Deep: 3 resources from the sphere best at generating them is a low price to pay for a defense 3, 2 health sentinel ally.\n * The Day's Rising: in certain types of decks this card is hilarious fun, and generates surprising amounts of free resources.\n\nLore:\n\n * Warden of Healing: splashes of healing often come more in handy than big single ones like from Daughter of the Nimrodel, Lembas, etc. Also, when you have Elrond (hero) on the table, even a single Warden becomes a powerhouse of heals.\n * Ranger Spikes: -2 threat and no engagement cost is an amazing lockdown tool, since it effectively removes many enemies from the game. Even better is if you also have Faramir (hero, Lr) out, since the Ranger Spike is basically a semi-permanent +1 attack for him.\n * Ambush: Another trap, this card is great if you're low on defenders since you can use that Combat action to defeat the enemy before they even have a chance to attack.\n\nSpirit:\n\n * Northern Tracker: some quests are lousy with locations, and there is little better than Norther Tracker for dealing with location floods.\n * The Galadhrim's Greeting: lowering threat by 6, or lowering everyone's by 2, is an incredibly powerful effect, even for three cost. This is in most of my Spirit decks.\n\nTactics:\n\n * Dúnedain Hunter: While it's less useful in enemy-light scenarios, in your average scenario this is an incredibly cheap 3-attack ally, as strong as some heroes.\n * Knight of Minas Tirith: It's been less powerful as of late, but this is a great card for clearing the staging area of smaller enemies, plus his 3 attack is no slouch for later.\n * For-hammer: with card draw often an issue for tactics decks, this card is a godsend for accelerating your options.\n\nNeutral:\n\n * Keen as Lances: Hard to pull off in your average deck, in ones built to make use of its special abilities its amazing, especially since playing one lowers the cost of playing another."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1903612","commentId":1903612,"userName":"DurinVoronwe","timestamp":1448206603,"content":"Maybe not the most powerful cards, but I love them.\n\n \n\nLeadership: Warden of Helms Deep.

I personally love me some Descendant of Thorondor, especially with Born Aloft and Meneldor's Flight being available.\n\n \n\nI don't necessarily agree with you on Expert Treasure Hunter though. In a balanced deck, you have a roughly 2/3 chance of just discarding the top of your deck every time you trigger it. While it's great with hero Gandalf (since his ability let's you always know what's on the top of your deck), it's far too risky in the average deck for my tastes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1903654","commentId":1903654,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1448209199,"content":"> Neutral is not a sphere, but I use Song of Wisdom the most from that binder.\n\nDefine a \"sphere\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1903692","commentId":1903692,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1448211934,"content":">  \n> \n> > Neutral is not a sphere, but I use Song of Wisdom the most from that binder.\n> \n> Define a \"sphere\".\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nI think he is referring to the Stand and Fight + Gandalf ruling that decided Neutral is not a sphere.

Lets us remember some of those decent cards we don't play anymore even though they really are pretty good (I'm lookin' at you, Gondorian Spearman). \n\n \n\nAnd Snowborn Scout IS an amazing chump, but I still think Squire of the Citadel JUST edges him out. You won't see him until next cycle though. But both of them together in a decent Imrahil deck? A thing of beauty :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] And even better later with Eomer!\n\n \n\nAs for me...well, there is a big chasm between my FAVORITE cards and the best. But since the question is about favorites...\n\n \n\nTactics: This is a hard one. I love the drama of Black Arrow and the badassery of The Hammer-Stroke or Gimli. But in the end, I have to go with a card that exudes both--Beorn! Few things more fun or dramatic as triggering his ability in the last turn of the game to cut down a Big Bad. \n\n \n\nLeadership: Lure of Moria. Me and my girlfriend played all the way from Core to Heirs (plus the Hobbit Boxes) with a pair of pure Dwarf theme decks. Loved the experience and it has forever skewed my appreciation of this card. So many great plays built on this card and so many fun memories. \n\n \n\nSpirit: Eowyn. So, she's just mechanically amazing. And bonkers when you start talking about her sphere-match with cards like Herugrim, UC and Snowmane. But she's also just FUN. Her ability is powerful, but feels organic and fun rather than mechanical (Elrond especially come to mind here). \n\n \n\nLore: Ally Elrond. Not super-powerful but I love it thematically as he bounces in, heals some terrible wound or gives some sage advice (card draw), and then bounces out. Also--condition removal is always important. \n\n \n\nNeutral: Okay--I'll say what everyone else is avoiding. GANDALF! He is just such a key part of the lore and the game ever since Core. The question is which Gandalf? Core is probably the most powerful if only because of his versatility and the existence of Sneak Attack.

That means the deck will almost certainly have Prince Imrahil at the front (as well as Valiant Sacrifice and PROBABLY Eomer and some Eagles since they love to leave play). Now to be fair, I usually end up running both Snowbourn Scout AND Squire of the Citadel in this kind of deck, but I'm USUALLY happier to see Squire simply because there may or may not be a location in play but I can ALWAYS use the extra resource. And if I'm running Eomer, HE usually gets the Steward to pay for expensive Eagles so it can work as resource fixing too. \n\n \n\nOtherwise I would rather just rely on strong utility defenders and readying effects to guard my board and try to avoid having to chump whenever possible. \n\n \n\nNow if I was just running a generic deck and wanted to sprinkle in a little chumpyness as some added protection early game (and didn't have a Gondor hero, obviously) then I would probably agree with you. But it still sucks to drop a Scout and not have him fire because there's not a location in play (very possible in 1 or 2 player). "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1906744","commentId":1906744,"userName":"DunedainLoreKeeper","timestamp":1448410129,"content":"Leadership: Path of need (I always include it in my leadership deck, then always remove it after playtesting because it sucks in them :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nTactics: Dúnedain Hunter (sooo many combo and deckbuilding possibilities)\n\nSpirit: Norther Tracker (Just feels good having an awesome Dúnedain come and break your location lock.

And the Sellsword looks hella-sexy. \n\n \n\nTo @John Constantine's point though, Dain may be preemptively nerfing the HIGH end of the Dwarf allies and Heroes. I could see FFG intentionally holding back just a bit ASSUMING that Dain would be in play when balancing a more powerful character (I feel like the new Dori may have fallen a little foul of this...) but the average dwarf is no pushover without Dain when looked at in the context of the whole cardpool. \n\n \n\n \n\n> Yeah, Dwarf allies are fine without Dain, and then Dain makes them better.

I think it would bite you pretty bad in a number of quests but it would work okay for a lot of them. \n\n \n\nI find Dain an interesting card to build around precisely because his effect is universal. As someone who plays the game pretty much exclusively with people who don't own it, I end up building everyone's decks myself to compliment eachother. That can present interesting decisions. \n\n \n\nThere are only so many Dwarves—how do I distribute them? Do I focus on the cheapest/weakest allies possible to leverage Dain to his maximum effect or bank on some of the slightly more expensive allies--and that's before we make room for some of the great Dwarf attachments and events. Leadership has the best Dwarf cards, how do I distribute them assuming Dain will be anchoring one Hero slot going in. Do I go Mono-Leadership for that deck and restrict the allies I can drop or give up Thorin or Balin (both great cards). \n\n \n\nMaybe it’s the way I build my decks (always building each one to compliment all the others with a single cardpool) but to me he DOES generate some interesting choices along with all the other Dwarf mechanics you mentioned. \n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1910060","commentId":1910060,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1448659458,"content":">  \n> \n> > And that's why Dain is restrictive, he literally nerfs every dwarf before their release.\n> \n>  \n> \n> In theory, yes.

Is that not a pattern enough for you? None of the spirit dwarf heroes has any of his willpower or attack stats above 2, and none of them has both his willpower and attack at 2 simultaneously and unconditioanlly.\n\n \n\nLore: \n\nNot a single 2 willpower ally. Only 2 allies out of 8 have an attack value of 2, both are unique. Lore dwarf heroes don't have nenither willpower, nor attack exceeding 2 (one of heroes even has 0 willpower and 1 attack).\n\n \n\nTactics: \n\nTactic dwarf allieas at least can provide you with some decent attack without Dain, but if you wanna take them questing - you'll be vaguely dissapointed.\n\nYou would think tactics dwarf heroes would shine in this department? Nope. Not a single wp/atk stat above 2, quite some are obviously below.\n\n \n\nSo this is not irony, it's harsh reality. Most of dwarf allies (and quite some heroes) suck stats-wise unless Dain is in play to compensate. \n\n \n\nThe upcoming Dwarven Sellsword drains your resources consistently, and that's why he has such inflated attack/willpower. Hindering him because of Dain's existance would be completely blasphemous, because he is obviously not supposed to be used solely for dwarf decks, but for any leadership deck that can use some kickstarting. Thanks god they didn't pre-rendered him for dwarfs only (though decision to make him a dwarf is questionable, as they could have just made him some non-developed trait to be completely neutral trait-effect wise, but this one benefits dwarf players who are going to use him, so it's ok)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1910103","commentId":1910103,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1448662726,"content":"It can be difficult to demonstrate with specifics (as every detail can begin it's own rabbit trail debate) but in essence I agree with John Constantine. The point he is making is about game design not game balance. The problem with a lot of cards is not that they are overpowered but that they prohibit future design. The designers eventually back themselves into a corner.\n\nLet me use the example of Northern Tracker. His ability is necessary to prevent landlock, especially in 3 or 4 player games. In solo he can often be overpriced and unnecessary. So, I would not say he is overpowered. Instead, his existence makes it extremely difficult for any other location control type card to exist. The only card that breaks through this is Asfaloth. Maybe with Gamling the Rohan tribe can provide competition, but basically whenever you see a location control card you think \"well I can just run Norther Tracker\".\n\nConsider a hypothetical alternative which illustrates the point. Let's say that in the Mirkwood cycle they decided to focus on locations with the \"river\" and \"riverland\" trait (which they did) or \"forest\". Then they made a card exactly like Northern Tracker but it only placed progress on river or riverland locations. Immediately all kinds of design space opens up because now you can have a \"Southern Tracker\" for marshland or mordor locations. You can have a character that puts progress on \"city\" locations for quests like trouble at Pelegrir or Tharbad. Unfortunately those cards really can't exist because Norhern Tracker blocks their design. By making Northern Tracker universal it severely limits the ability for designers to make creative cards.\n\nThis is why a card is more bland the more universal it becomes. Imagine if Dain gave his boost to all allies instead of just Dwarves. It would completely ruin the game. Not because Dain would be too powerful, but because it would become extremely difficult to design alternatives. That is John's point. That is why I agree with him about Steward of Gondor. It should have had some kind of restriction. Treebeard should not be able to rule Gondor.\n\nEdited November 27, 2015 by DukeWellington"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1910193","commentId":1910193,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1448669141,"content":"All fair points.

You shouldn't draw sweeping conclusions about nerfs from such a small set. This is especially true when you look at those allies individually:\n\n \nBofur - One of the best questers in the game.\nBlue Mountain Trader - Designed with his ability in mind as his primary use, which was so good it had to be nerfed. Him having 2 willpower on top of that would make him crazy powerful, as all the spirit allies with 2 willpower and 2 health are unique.\nDwalin - A sentinel defender not designed for questing. The only Sentinel allies will two willpower cost 1 extra.\nKili - I'm going to go ahead and say that nobody plays this guy without Fili, so he should be thought of as having essentially double his stats.\nZigil Miner - We all know this guy would get played with no stats whatsoever.\n \nIt seems that the spirit dwarves allies are not even part of the dwarf swarm archtype, with the exception of Kili who normally comes into play from the leadership Fili. So I wouldn't expect them to be designed with Dain in mind anyway.\n \nAs for lore, the average attack for an ally (not including Ents or Elrond, but I am including Quickbeam) is exactly 1. It's lower if you discount Quickbeam who is considered to be overpowered. The average attack for a lore dwarf ally (not including Record Keeper who cannot attack) is also exactly 1. It's almost like Dain has had no affect at all. The average lore ally willpower is just 1.05 so it's not like only having 1 is a huge loss. And when you consider the abilities most of the dwarf allies have (the Map-maker has given me enormous willpower boosts) it's another moot point.\n \n\n> My last response wasn't that great as I think about it because I answered within the paradigm of game balance instead of design.

Dwalin wasn't designed for questing because they wanted him to be a combat character. Fili and Kili have the same stats because the designers wanted them to have the same stats.\n\nAnd personally, I've made plenty of use of the Zigil Miner and the Lore Dwarf allies without Dain. We have started getting some better Lore allies in more recent packs, but I'd still rate the Dwarves pretty well.\n\n \n\n> > > They ARE designed with Dain in mind, every dwarf is, because if they wouldn't - their stats wouldn't be so critically small.\n> > \n> > Wasn't it just statistically proven that dwarves tend to have good stats?\n> \n> No. You should read the whole conversation, not separate parts of it.\n\nNo, that is actually exactly what has happened. You disregarding it does not mean it didn't happen.\n\n \n\nI certainly agree with DukeWellington that Dain is not as good or as interesting a design as Celeborn or Spirit Theoden, and I can see the point about design space being limited by putting too much into him back then.

We must take into account that there are unique allies, and non-unique allies, and that there cannot be more than 1 unique ally in play at once. (And let's drop the fact that various unique dwarf allies share names with dwarf heroes and even with each other, dropping their effectiveness even further).\n\n \n\nHence what we'll do is take each non-unique ally and multiply it's count and willpower by 3, while leaving unique ones alone.\n\n \n\nThe numbers will shock you:\n\nRohan: 40 willpower across 36 allies=1.11\nDwarf: 39 willpower across 50 allies =0,78\n \nA little bit more bitter details:\n \nSpirit Dwarves:\nCost: 17.5/9=1.94\nWillpower: 10/9=1.11\nAttack: 6/9=0.67\n \nLore Dwarves:\nCost: 38/18=2.11\nWillpower: 14/18=0.77\nAttack: 13/18=0.72\n \n \nPlease, once again, if you want to discuss it further - let's make it in some place it won't take so many time to express our opinions.\n \n \n\n>  \n> \n> > Neither defense nore health help you progress, they help you stall.\n> \n> I guess you're not a huge fan of Beregond, then. :-D\n> \n> Personally, I love to have more good defending characters in my decks, as they let me take on more enemies more confidently. But to each his own.\n\nI love them too, but to make progress on the quest, to win in and to not threat out - you need willpower (unless it's siege, but it's a whole different story). To prevent enemies piling on on you (and eventually overrunning you, as there might be more enemies than you have defenders), you need attack. Defending is good, but without anything to strike back, the defense is just a stall for defeat.\n\nEdited November 28, 2015 by John Constantine"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1910916","commentId":1910916,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1448743012,"content":"The Outlands comment was meant ad a joke.

My point is that Dain limits design. That is why I made the point about Visionary Leadership, because that example seems to make my point totally obvious.\n\nNow Seastan asked a good question, \"what more do you expect?\" Well, John actually answered it, but I will restate it. The point is to have a low cost ally with 3 willpower or 3 attack (not both, one or the other). In other words, an ally that specializes in questing or attacking. Now the Dwarves have the attacker (Erebor Battlemaster) in a dedicated Dwarf deck, but not a quester. In contrast, Ents have Quickbeam to attack and Wellinghall has 3 willpower. So, IMO, with Ents they would not give a global buff like that which Dain provides. They have gone in a different dirrection, using the \"comes into play exhausted\" to compensate. So, it's either global buff or high stats, but you can't have both. If you do, the result is OP, like...

So? Just because there are three heroes of a certain trait in a sphere does not automatically mean that the designers have made the mono-sphere option viable for that trait. A mono lore Noldor deck would also be bad, as would a secrecy mono spirit Gondor deck with Eleanor and Caldara. \n \nIf your point is that some traits are more heavily tied to certain spheres than others, then I agree. That's just how the designers have made the game. In the case of Dwarves, even without Dain, they probably expect most players would see Narvi's Belt, Hardy Leadership, We Are not Idle, and Lure of Moria, and King Under the Mountain all in the Leadership sphere and think \"Hey, maybe I should use some Leadership cards in my Dwarf deck.\"\n \n\nMy issue wasn't with sphere balance. It was with this: \n\n \n\n> They ARE designed with Dain in mind, every dwarf is, because if they wouldn't - their stats wouldn't be so critically small.\n\n \n\nThis is such a huge claim, especially the \"every dwarf\" part. Look at the dwarves we have and add a willpower and attack to them but keep the cost the same. They become overpowered and destroy the cost curve of the game. Zigil miner with 2/2/1/1, Fili and Kili at 2/2/1/2, potential 1-cost allies Bofur at 3/2/1/3 and Dwalin at 2/2/2/3 sentinel. There is just no sign that these allies would've had more stats without Dain because it would break the cost curve they have used with every other trait."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1911470","commentId":1911470,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1448808134,"content":"Yes, but if you'll try to combine Oin with anything but leadership, because lore dwarves suck across both atk and wp, tactics dwarves are good with attack but have no wp, and spirit dwarves themselves are not much of neither willpower nor attack (remember, I judge this one purely on solo experience, this all argument gets negated if we have a second player with Dain in his deck).\n\n \n\nI'll go into a little bit more detail here: Nori and Oin both imply dwarf tribing happening, but we can't combine spirit with anything but leadership and hope to be successful, because without Dain, none of this decks would have sufficient stats to perform, this is not a mono-spirit talk. More of it, most disastrous combination would be lore+spirit dwarves, which would have decent amount of dwarves and stuff.\n\n \n\nMy point is and was all along: Dain's existance hurts all Dwarf characters willpower and attack, essentially killing any attempts at Dwarfs without Dain in solo (I'm sure there is some clever stuff one can do to make something like this work, but I'm also sure that it will be mostly due to not dwarf related stuff). I think that Dwarves could have been much more interesting and self-efficient archetype that exists in all spheres (and is at least somewhat viable in most spheres and combinations), if a staple like Dain would not exist. And then and now every Dwarf coming out is getting double-evaluated due to Dain and turns out a little bit weaker because of him. Staples like him hurt the future game design possibilities.\n\n \n\nAdding willpower and attack together is not a right way to do it, because a character that has 2 willpower and 0 attack (or vice versa) provides a meaningful impact on his own, while a 1 willpower 1 attack character can be barely felt and won't make huge difference by his very presence. Well, I did not sey that without Dain they would have stats just like they have with Dain, but some of them could have that 1 missing point of stat in a right place to make them valuable picks for non-Dain decks (and make them tremendously powerful for their cost with Dain)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1911498","commentId":1911498,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1448810295,"content":"A few solo dwarf decks have already been posted that don't use Dain.
