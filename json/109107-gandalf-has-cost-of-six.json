But no he definitely costs 5, he was just going to cost 6 until they changed it to 5 (before release of the core)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109107-gandalf-has-cost-of-six/?do=findComment&comment=1128452","commentId":1128452,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1403358300,"content":"Thank you for explanation :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109107-gandalf-has-cost-of-six/?do=findComment&comment=1129793","commentId":1129793,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1403500402,"content":"he originally was 6, before the release fo the first core and was adjusted down during playtesting."}]}
