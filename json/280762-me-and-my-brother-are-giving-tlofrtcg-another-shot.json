Which means you'll generally want to buy the Deluxe first. Of course, you may want to pick up some of the adventure packs while available if you're waiting for a deluxe box to be reprinted, in which case you can still use all of the player cards from those packs. But you won't be able to play the quests.\n\nEdited August 10, 2018 by Will Anderson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280762-me-and-my-brother-are-giving-tlofrtcg-another-shot/?do=findComment&comment=3436530","commentId":3436530,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1533908748,"content":"> 4 hours ago, Dainank said:\n>  * How worthwhile are deluxe expansions?\n>    1.

Do they provide a nice challenge?\n\nThe duluxes and cycles are all worthwhile (of course, to play quests in a cycle you need the corresponding deluxe). I would go with Khazad-dum+Dwarrowdelf, Grey Havens+Dreamchaser, or Wilds of Rhovanion+Ered Mithrin (the current cycle).\n\nYes, I would buy at least a second core to open up better deck-building options (and to get those extra two threat trackers). Three is nice, but the only reason to get that third copy of some of the cards (some of them are really worth it, though). Note that the core is the only set that has less than three copies of any player card.\n\nThe standalone scenarios are very good, but very hard. The newest, the Wizard's Quest is fairly easy, though; and it's really innovative. It was pre-released at Gen Con this year, but should be available in a month or two.\n\nSome just make easy scenarios normal difficulty, others make the quest nigh impossible. In all cases, they are much worth the money. They have great art and theme, and go along way in fixing some quest mechanics."}]}
