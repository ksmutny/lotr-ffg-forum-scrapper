So I wouldn't be overly sad to learn that there won't be a Balrog and that there won't be any Moria. I would really rejoice in being able to visit some other locations and explore some quests not directly to the lotr storyline. Also I think this is where most of the potential lies for the game.\n\nHowever, as mentioned before it also depends on the license that ffg has, since that will strongly govern the possible directions of the game to take.\n\nApart from setting related wishes, I really hope that some new mechanics will be introduced later on, enhancing the game exprience and increasing replayability.\n\nAnd another item for the wishlist: A fun singleplayer experience. I would just love it, if could also really enjoy this alone.

It is sad but EVERY card game ends with something familiar – cards from later expansions are much more powerfull than from core/base set.

So I'm not trying to change your mind here, because you're right, people approach this from different angles. But to me there's one big reason why it's ok, and maybe it even would have been ok to John Ronald Reuel himself, to expand the world of Middle Earth: Tolkien's goal was a mythology. I can guarantee that there wasn't one dude back in ancient Greece who sat down and came up with the entire pantheon of gods and all there stories all at once, and nobody ever was allowed to change anything. It's not the way of oral histories. And I think Tolkien himself would have recognized it.\n\n \n\nSo sure, various re-tellings have gotten details wrong, such as Sam climbing back down the stairs of Cirith Ungol (my personal biggest pet peeve from the movies) but the simple fact is that people have adopted his world as a mythology. I hope he would have embraced things like people adding on to his work. Chris is in the difficult position of wanting to preserve his father's legacy but at the same time keeping it in the public's eye.\n\nIn the end I think you've compared it to the wrong kind of art. It's not the Mona Lisa, or any other painting where it's just what it is. It's a song, where different pacing, rhythms, beats, or whatever else you want to change when you cover a song means that a different person can express what it means to them. I can tell you're a huge Gandalf fan from your other posts. But the character that I love the most is Sam, because of his loyalty. The makers of this game probably have their own favorites. In the end, though, they love the source material enough to try their own version of it and see if we love their version.\n\nIn the end, you can choose to just have a party of heroes that existed in the original, and that's fine if that's how you want to play. But I can't see why you'd be upset that somebody is basically saying \"I love this work so much that it inspires me to create something new.\" Because that's art, too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450706","commentId":450706,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1302226248,"content":" That was brilliant.

It's per definition not the exact same story as Tolkien told it. But you do get the chance to relive the spirit of it through adventures and scenarios that connect with the universe Tolkien created.

I think I can understand all the opinions and I also think there is no right or wrong to this, but it is really interesting to hear everyone's opinion on this - and why they feel this way.\n\nI personally played the lotr TCG by decipher and I liked the first block very well (The Fellowship of the Ring + Expansions) and I really thought it to be a very interesting game with having both good and evil in one's deck. The reason I lost interest in the game over time, however, is because Decipher started to (in my opinion) add fictive characters or unknown characters to randomly. It just lost the feel it used to have in the beginning. What I regretted most is that the game was based on the movie and used pictures and names from the movies. This limited the game too much already before it started. They were predestined to run out of material eventually.\n\nAnd that is why I already love ffgs lotr card game so much: It is not restricted by the movie, but it draws directly from Tolkien's vast universe he creaated. And as Scoopb put it so nicely, I also believe that Middle Earth was supposed to live. Like a song or a tale that is retoled many times over and over again until nobody knows the original story anymore and nobody can tell what was and what wasn't. We can see this also as recurring theme in Tolkien's work, obviously he was a big admirer of folklore and myths. Since he left us his legacy it is our job to stick to the guideline that Tolkien presented to us and should be able to explore and expand it. Now, of course there will always be people that don't quite managed to catch the spirit of the original in their work, but there are also people who manage to do so very well. I do have faith in ffg that if they create new characters, they give enough background and ties to these characters to make them believable and lovable and I would welcome this option. I would be put off by having to play a \"Random Gondor Swordsman #5\" because only he fits my combo, though. Let's wait and see how it turns out. I am sure that ffg know what they're doing and that they are aware that they tread on quite light water when dealing with material that has such a vast fan community as Lotr. There is a lot of potential for sure...and I realy love ffg for turning purposely away from the movies! lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]\n\n \n\nservant of the secret fire said:\n\n \n\nBut as i said before and i am saying this one more time and this is only my personal opinion that adding a commoner or an imaginery character is a lot different from making Gandalf ringbearer or Sam killing the Blarog with his sword.I can't explain this very well but i think you can understand what i want to say.\n\n \n\n \n\nWell, it is hard to imagine that ffg will go that far, isn't it ;-)\n\n \n\n> Look at Legolas card, sure don't look like Orladon frikkin Bloom to me.\n\nSpeaking of which: It keeps freaking me out, but the Aragorn artwork keeps reminding me of Prof. Snape (Alan Rickman) from the Harry Potter movie...please tell me I' wrong!!preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450865","commentId":450865,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1302255174,"content":"faith_star83 said:\n\n \n\n \n\nservant of the secret fire said:\n\n \n\nBut as i said before and i am saying this one more time and this is only my personal opinion that adding a commoner or an imaginery character is a lot different from making Gandalf ringbearer or Sam killing the Blarog with his sword.I can't explain this very well but i think you can understand what i want to say.\n\n \n\n \n\nWell, it is hard to imagine that ffg will go that far, isn't it ;-)\n\n \n\n \n\nYes i aggre with you thats why i am still here and i am waitting for this gamelengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].\n\nAs for Lotr TCG yes it was greate at the begining but i think that Desipher went out from ideas.At later expantions they tried to add some characters from the books wich we didnt saw in the movies like Grimbeorn and Tom Bombadil but they used them with the wrong way.And yes you are right Desipher's game was limited before it started.\n\nMe and some friends we still have all the cards from Lotr TCG and we play very often and wen we see cards like 'strange looking man' we can understand that Desipher's only goal was money and not how to make their game better."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450905","commentId":450905,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1302258836,"content":"That surprises you that Decipher was trying to make money ?  partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450933","commentId":450933,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1302261965,"content":"Toqtamish said:\n\nThat surprises you that Decipher was trying to make money ?  partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif]\n\n\n\nNo thats the mane goal of all companies.No one makes a game just to please people or because they are so good and they want to give pleasure to humanity.\n\nBut some companies take your money and they give you back a nice and a worth play game and you feel that you give your money to somethink good and you don't just throw your money from the window.That does not count for Desipher.They used a big name like Lotr just to take your money and they gave you back a piece of s***t.People at that time realised that they don't even bother to test their game and their new cards and thats why this game is a memory.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44476-wish-list/?do=findComment&comment=450994","commentId":450994,"userName":"radioboyeric","timestamp":1302266980,"content":"It totally looks like Alan Rickman (Snape)!!!
