On a response, such as on Eleanor [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/eleanor-core] or Erebor Hammersmith [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/erebor-hammersmith-core] , do you have to do the response? Like do I have to exhaust Eleanor when a treachery card is revealed or is it my choice?

Responses are always optional, and can\nbe triggered by their controller in response to (i.e.\nimmediately after) a specified game occurrence.
