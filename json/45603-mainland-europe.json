Here in holland none of the shops know of a new release date, and all the companies that deliver to the shops have a release date of november 2010. Did the english language game sell so fast that all the copies ran out before it reached the counties in europe that do not get their own localized translation?\n\nThis is kind of dissapointing, and happens a lot with FFG releases, I had to wait for cosmic conflict for almost 2 months before it came to holland after the so called release. I am really hoping enough copied were printed so that we in holland do not have to wait half a year for the next batch. Problems with printing or not, I want the game. For most the wait is over, for us it still goes on, and there isn't even a clear date when it will come.\n\nI know the UK got the game, but is anyone else in europe except holland still waiting for their english language release?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45603-mainland-europe/?do=findComment&comment=457448","commentId":457448,"userName":"dj2.0","timestamp":1303452364,"content":"yes, still waiting here in Berlin, my guys say next week, I will let you know.  Have hope, my friend, do not let the shadow hold sway over your heart!
