I prefer to build without buying extra. I'll see how that works but it seemed to me that the point of the LCG wasn't to chase cards for powerdecks.  Although, playing through the core quests has proven quite challenging which makes a good game great.\n\nJust my opinion. For those that are building from redundant sets, carry on!  As long as we're all enjoying what we do :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
