You are not targeting Bolg directly with player cards and thus circumvent his player card immunity.\n\nEdited October 15, 2013 by Nerdmeister"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92040-bolg-hands-upon-the-bow/?do=findComment&comment=889071","commentId":889071,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1381833227,"content":"Yes, not cheat then.

It would be difficult, but it should be possible with Hands Upon the Bow recycling (from Hama or the Book of Eldacar) and enough attack boosts. Someone posted a session report [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/798617/flight-or-fight-or-to-kill-a-balrog-official-answe] on BGG where Dunhere used Dunedain Marks, Support of the Eagles, Keeping Count, and Grave Cairn to kill the Nameless Fear. Nate French then ruled that Dunhere's targetting was a player card effect, and so The Nameless Fear was immune\n\n \n\nFor Flight from Moria, I think it's problematic to allow The Nameless Fear to be destroyed. Aside from broader story concerns, the mechanics of the quest tie into The Nameless Fear with A Foe Beyond [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/a-foe-beyond-kd], and Blocked by Shadow [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/?search_value=&sort_col=field_141&sort_order=asc&per_page=30&st=0] and Shadow of Fear [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/shadow-of-fear-kd] are thematically connected to The Nameless Fear. One possible solution would be to use errata to add \"Indestructible\" to The Nameless Fear. Another would be to reverse the Hands Upon the Bow ruling, which hasn't yet become official in the FAQ."}]}
