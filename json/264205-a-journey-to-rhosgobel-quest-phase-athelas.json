To Guarded this Athelas we reveal another card. I know that this other card (enemy, location or treachery) does not count in \"a card per player\".\n\nBut that other card was another Athelas. We added in the staging area and revealed two cards to guarded them.\n\nDoes this second Athelas count in \"a card per player\"?
