Good ol' FFG coming through before anyone who went to Gencon did!! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nRedhorn gate looks BRUTAL, Watcher looks insanely fun and I love that you can optionally engage the watcher now and not have him sitting in staging laughing at you! Road to Rivendell looks pretty spectacular too and I always wondered why the quest didn't make enemies who engage via ambush count their threat towards questing, glad they fixed that as many times I've had two ambush enemies appear in one turn resulting in no threat in staging/for resolution (so long as it was clear to begin with). Having to fight an ambush party that actually abduct Arwen is just awesome!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/115267-nightmares-in-the-dwarrowdelf/?do=findComment&comment=1229879","commentId":1229879,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1409192067,"content":"Sounds very ok!  I like the fact:  Road to Rivendell now is playable quest! I love ambush mechanic but since it was so easy i never play this quest for last 2 years. Now is looks ok. Watcher same story!

If they had done this though it would have been too insanely hard, even just a -1 willpower to all characters effect on something would utterly DECIMATE considering Caradhras already gives -1 to questing characters.
