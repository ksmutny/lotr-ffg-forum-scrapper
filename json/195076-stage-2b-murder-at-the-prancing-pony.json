I've re-read the player side quest section of the Lost Realm several times recently and it doesn't make that point explicitly clear, which is what got me off the rails.\n\n \n\nOddly enough I've never played Battle of Five Armies (or the Lonely Mountain). I didn't really like Flies and Spiders all that much (I found turning my cards upside down to be annoying and something that just kind of broke the mood for me), so I never progressed on to the last two quests of \"On the Doorstep\". I'll have to find some time to play those."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195076-stage-2b-murder-at-the-prancing-pony/?do=findComment&comment=1922053","commentId":1922053,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1449459851,"content":"I strongly recommend it!  The community seems to have mixed feelings about The Lonely Mountain, but the last quest in that box, The Battle of Five Armies, is widely loved.  It's easily my favorite of the \"large battle\" type quests (and also it's one of the least challenging with that theme, which makes it easier to break out at community meet-ups).\n\nEdited December 7, 2015 by GrandSpleen"}]}
