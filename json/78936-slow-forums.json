It is a shame because I love the community here and now my participation in it is so limited (I try to read at least some of the posts and rarely respond as it takes so much waiting and I am not big on multi-tasking). Luckily activity on BGG's entry for LOTR:LCG is on the rise and Polish boards abut this game are also very vibrant. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78936-slow-forums/?do=findComment&comment=762068","commentId":762068,"userName":"Nick Demus","timestamp":1360722974,"content":"I simply make bookmarks for every subboard I want to check, open all of them at once in different tabs, open another tab for looking at some other stuff while the board pages load, and then work myself through every tab that finished loading, opening topics I want to read in new tabs as well.
