It's not that easy, but capture's the theme and atmosphere the book creates perfectly. Iirc this quest also was the winner of the quests championship that was run here a while ago, so it is a bit of a \"mainstream recommendation\".\n\nYeah you only wanted \"the one quest\", but I can't keep myself from entioning some more, as there were many memorable quests in the newer cycles: If you love \"extreme\" difficulty go for \"the battle of carn-Dûm\" (Angmar Awakens-cycle AP 5). High replay-ability and an interessting twist for the location mechanic can be found in \"temple of the deceived\" (dreamchaser-cycle AP 3). My personal favourite from Harad so far is \"the long arm of Mordor\" (Sands of hard-box) with another take on the \"captive heroes\"-mechanic.\n\n \n\nBut as I said \"Helm's Deep\", for me, is the one quest you should know."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248419-if-you-had-to-choose-one-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2760503","commentId":2760503,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1493505231,"content":"Helm's Deep is a good suggestion, if you're looking for just one quest.

Many people complain about this quest being too easy, while failing to realize it means you can go with non-meta decks and still have fun and decent challenge without being steamrolled."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248419-if-you-had-to-choose-one-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2760790","commentId":2760790,"userName":"dr00","timestamp":1493543386,"content":"Voyage Across Belegaer (the first quest from The Grey Havens) and/or Flight of the Stormcaller (the first pack in the Dream-Chaser cycle)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248419-if-you-had-to-choose-one-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2763536","commentId":2763536,"userName":"Crusaderlord","timestamp":1493722308,"content":"I play solo one handed - i have not got all the expansions yet but i have played quite a lot. I put my thoughts about the quests (not the player cards) on my website so feel free to take a look.\n\nhttp://crusadersgolf.co.uk/board-games/lord-of-the-rings-lcg/ [http://crusadersgolf.co.uk/board-games/lord-of-the-rings-lcg/]\n\nFavourite quests will vary hugely from person to person depending on each players preferences for difficulty or theme.
