It's one of those \"automatical engagment\" enemies which ignores normal rules and timing of engagement.\n\nLet's say you are playing solo, your threat is 30 and you have the Orc-Chieftain in the staging area after the quest phase. At the start of the encounter phase it engages you (it does make an engagement check, it just automatically engages) since you are by default the first player.\n\nEdited October 6, 2019 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300849-orc-chieftain-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=3800666","commentId":3800666,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1570389662,"content":"In this game \"engaging\" an enemy means that it goes from wherever it is (usually the staging area) to the player's area (not sure what the technical term for this is, but you put it near all your cards). This enemy is now \"engaged\" with that player and is no longer in the staging area. Then, during the combat phase, engaged enemies attack the player. So, the Orc-Chieftain's text causes it, at the beginning of the encounter phase, to immediately move to the first player's area. It is now engaged with that player and is no longer in the staging area. Since it is not in the staging area, you don't make engagement checks against it in the rest of the encounter phase, but since it's already engaged you this is kinda irrelevant. Then, in the combat phase, it's still engaged with the player and so makes an attack. Then the player gets to respond. If the Orc-Chieftain isn't dead, then like any other enemy it stays where it is for the moment and doesn't go back to the staging area unless you do something specific to send it there.\n\nNext round, if you're playing solo, it's already engaged with you, so its effect doesn't do anything in the encounter phase. If you're playing multiplayer, then it will go to the new first player in the next encounter phase and then attack that player in the combat phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300849-orc-chieftain-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=3800697","commentId":3800697,"userName":"caribecards","timestamp":1570392011,"content":"Thank you guys,\n\nNow I understand how it works, just one more question, in the case of The Balrog is different because the text says \" while in the staging area.
