This is a mission based on proper timing. Rather than outright beat up the bad guys. it is a nice change of pace.\n\nRhosgobel poses the players with a nice wrinkle and would suck if you had the 4 pop up too soon."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53051-return-to-rhosgobel-question/?do=findComment&comment=527250","commentId":527250,"userName":"Dwnhmcntryboy","timestamp":1315853316,"content":"\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53051-return-to-rhosgobel-question/?do=findComment&comment=527280","commentId":527280,"userName":"Dwnhmcntryboy","timestamp":1315858820,"content":" disreguard the 4 popping up"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53051-return-to-rhosgobel-question/?do=findComment&comment=527402","commentId":527402,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1315887586,"content":"TheGrue said:\n\n So, I just picked up the Rhosgobel question and was looking at the quest cards and am wondering about 3B, which is called Return to Rhosgobel.  On here, it looks like when you flip it over, you basically check how many Athelas cards your party owns and if you have enough to heal Wilyador back to full, you win.  My question is....why would you ever complete the stage before this to turn this card up?  I briefly skimmed through the cards and didn't really see anything that might force you to place progress tokens down on 2B to rush completing this stage before you are ready.  It just seems odd to have a card with a win condition like this that could basically be avoided until you either lose or have enough Athelas to put down the last bit of progress.\n\n \n\nI guess if you are going to locations, you might have some splash progress that progresses it before you are ready.  Just want to make sure I'm not missing some concept here.\n\n\n\neagle is dying so you need to rush 2B stage and at the same time you need to find enough athelas.

Every player has a discard pile and the encounter cards have the encounter discard pile. I took the wording of Forest Grove literally, and saw me allowed to search only the encounter deck and my player discard pile.\nBefore your post, Radiskull, I thought discarded Athelas cards go to the player discard pile (because they are attached to a hero, and player attachment cards go to the discard pile if their character is destroyed. This is wrong, I now think, because Atheals still remains an objective.). It made sense for me to search my own discard pile to get those Athelas back. I only was wondering wether I also could get back the Athelas cards which were discarded because of shadow card draws.\n\nAfter looking into the rules, on p. 10 is stated:\n\"Discard Piles: Each player has his own discard pile, and the encounter deck also has its own discard pile. Whenever a card is discarded, it goes to the discard pile belonging to the card’s originating deck.\"\n\nNow it's clear that Athelas cards go into encounter discard pile. (Perhaps the wording of Forest Grove could be a little different, like \"After the players explore Forest Grove, search the encounter deck and the encounter discard pile for 1 Athelas objective...\" for avoiding misunderstandings.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53051-return-to-rhosgobel-question/?do=findComment&comment=528028","commentId":528028,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1316008652,"content":"Ah, I understand the confusion now.  Yeah, you can never put a card into a place it doesn't belong - you can never put another player's card into your own discard pile, deck or hand.  You can never put a hero card into your hand.  You can never put an encounter card into a player's discard pile, deck, or hand.  You can never put a player card into the encounter discard pile.  You can never put a quest card ANYWHERE.\n\n \n\nBut I can see how that rule may have been easy to miss. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Consider, though - if you put Athelas into your discard pile, then return the card to your hand..how the heck do you play it?  (one of the reasons why this is something to avoid.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53051-return-to-rhosgobel-question/?do=findComment&comment=528127","commentId":528127,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1316019614,"content":"That's right.
