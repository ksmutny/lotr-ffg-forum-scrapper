Road to Rivendell\n\n10. Shelob's Lair\n\nI have a lot of easy quests because I love to test out a lot of wacky builds. I've probably played the Seventh Level more than any other quest. It is fast, simple, and fun. I also enjoy quests with a strong setting--they put you in a specific context with the narrative. I really love many other quests. It's difficult to cut it down to 10."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225208-top-ten-favorite-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=2314835","commentId":2314835,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1468835820,"content":"1. A Knife in the Dark - Awesome Quest!\n\n2. Journey in the Dark - Awesome Quest!\n\n3. Helm's Deep - Unique mechanics and great atmosphere!\n\n4. The Stewert's Fear - High replayability and not that easy\n\n5. The Morgul Vale - My favorite \"boss-fight\" quest\n\n6. Deadmen's Dike - Nothing really special about this quest, but I like it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n7. Breaking of the Fellowship - Beats Foundations of Stone for me.\n\n8. Temple of the Deceived - New and Shiny :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n9. The Battle of Carn Dûm - The hardest quest for me at the moment (nightmare excluded)\n\n10. Escape from Mount Gram - Fun but easy^^"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225208-top-ten-favorite-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=2315321","commentId":2315321,"userName":"Eldainorn","timestamp":1468856818,"content":"1. Into Ithilien (hands down, amazing quest)\n\n2. Steward's Fear \n\n3. The Siege of Cair Andros\n\n4. Journey Down the Anduin\n\n5. Trouble in Tharbad (sooo thematic)\n\n6. Battle of Five Armies\n\n7. Journey in the Dark\n\n8. A Shadow of the Past\n\n9. A Knife in the Dark\n\n10. Assault on Osgiliath\n\n \n\nIt was much harder to pick 10 quests than I though it would be. The first three are definitely my favourite ones (or the first five). Into Ithilien is simply amazing.\n\n \n\nMy favourite cycle by far is also HoN + AtS, as can be seen from my picks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225208-top-ten-favorite-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=2315472","commentId":2315472,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1468860398,"content":"In no particular order:\n\nRoad to Rivendell\n\nFoundations of Stone\n\nFog on the Barrow-downs\n\nThe Steward's Fear\n\nShadow and Flame\n\nVoyage Across Belegaer\n\nThe Stone of Erech\n\nThe Dread Realm\n\nThe Druadan Forest\n\nShadow of the Past"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225208-top-ten-favorite-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=2315661","commentId":2315661,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1468867205,"content":"i usually like scenarios that not require special deckbilding, like:\n \n\nanduin\n\nmassing osgiliath\n\nrivendel\n\n7th level\n\ninto the pit\n\nstewards fear\n\namon din\n\nfoundations\n\ncatch an orc\ncelebrimbor"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225208-top-ten-favorite-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=2320050","commentId":2320050,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1469104222,"content":"I still have to play a ton of quests.

For example:\n\nPtM: Draw Ungoliant's Spawn, defend with Snowby, Shadow is Hummerhorns, kill Snowby, undefended.\n\nHfG: Old Wifes Tales in Setup.\n\nHoEM: Multiple rockslides.\n\nTDM:Lots of escape tests during setup and nobody's ready to deal with the two hill trolls.\n\nAnd those are the easy ones."}]}
