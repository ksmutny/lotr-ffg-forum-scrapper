I find it completely absorbing.\n\nMy intention is to stick to the saga expansions. I have both Hobbit expansions, which I’m playing through now (managed to finally beat Flies and Spiders yesterday!). I’ve also got the road darkens and the land of shadow but I cannot find the black riders or treason of Saruman anywhere in Canada online. Does anyone know of any retailers that have a copy of each or a second hand source (aside from eBay obviously)? The US is not an option right now. \n\nFeel free to also provide me with purchase recommendations outside of the saga expansions. \n \n\n "}]}
