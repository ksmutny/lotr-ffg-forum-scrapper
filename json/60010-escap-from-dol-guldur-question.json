But, to win the game, do you still have to have those cards?\n\nIn one of my play throughs, I got to a point that I had gotten all the needed quest points and could kill the Nazgul, but only if I left another attack undefended. I got through the Nazgul's shadow card and attack, then resolved the other shadow card in play. That shadow card said if the attack was undefended, to discard all attachments, which means all of the objective cards went back to the staging area. On my attack, the Nazgul was killed. \n\nThe objectives are not mentioned on the 3b card, so does that make it a win?\n\n \n\nThanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60010-escap-from-dol-guldur-question/?do=findComment&comment=589639","commentId":589639,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1328302718,"content":"you won.. and you killed the nazgull.. well done... though you might have got a better score by runnign away from him :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nYour right though.. you need the objective cards only to escape... once that quest card is flipped.. you no longer need those items."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60010-escap-from-dol-guldur-question/?do=findComment&comment=589640","commentId":589640,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1328302971,"content":"No, as the objectives are not mentioned in the winning condition of the quest, they are not needed for the completion of the quest in the end"}]}
