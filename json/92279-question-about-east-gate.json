But since it's a victory-card, it never gets placed in the discard-pile, or the staging area, once explored. And since it's immune to card effects, it can never be removed otherwise.\n\n \n\nThen why does it have the big threat strength of 7???\n\n \n\nWhat am i missing?\n\n \n\nIf the answer is, that it gets used later in some other scenario, then that's great news.

The only way to\n\nplace progress tokens on it is by questing, and once Eastgate\n\nis the active location it remains the active location\n\nuntil it is fully explored (even cards like Dreadful Gap or\n\nStrider’s Path would not be able to move it to the staging\n\narea)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92279-question-about-east-gate/?do=findComment&comment=891527","commentId":891527,"userName":"Tarkan","timestamp":1382108662,"content":"Is it possible to get some kind of official answer to this?

The clarification in the rules sheet insert confirms this. You cannot directly effect the East-Gate with cards while it is in play, and the only way to place progress tokens on it is through questing successfully. My guess is that the high-threat on the card is to thematically represent how dangerous of a location it is. Not everything in this game has a mechanical basis, some of the design decisions are for providing the style/theme."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92279-question-about-east-gate/?do=findComment&comment=891623","commentId":891623,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1382116865,"content":"indeed- the answer is directly from the rules insert.\n\nfurther clarification can be seen from the fact that caleb changed the rulings on immune locations that they cannot even have the likes of ancient mathom attatched to them\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92279-question-about-east-gate/?do=findComment&comment=891640","commentId":891640,"userName":"13thcaesar","timestamp":1382117776,"content":"Maybe FFG just left the door open for the future?
