Of course we had seen some of the party before but then Bofur surprisingly, one of the least memorable of Thorin's Co., got another ally version of himself. And with his brother Bombur, and the corresponding ally card which must be among the worst cards in the entire game, there could be hope for a repeat. We might see another four heroes for each \"basic\" sphere, but out of the six remaining Dwarves only Balin will probably make it among those. It would only feel right to get other races included, especially we may be looking forward to Bard and Thranduil, I'd go far as calling the two sure bets for two hero slots, and I would be guessing Tactics for Bard and Leadership for Thranduil. Balin may get Lore or more likely Spirit but who then? Will it be another surprise hero like Nori and Ori - who in terms of game mechanics seem super powerful, or shall we see Gwaihir as a hero? It would then take the Tactics slot most likely. And what about some generic allies, in the first part we only got uniques, which makes sense. The second part could hold a spot or two for a Mirkwood Spearman, Swordsman or Archer. As a wish, I hope Beorn shall see a card to cooperate with him - though it is rather hard to achieve; how about \"all enemies get -1 (or 2, depending on the cost) attack strength till the end of the phase\"?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70282-what-to-expect-from-the-rest-of-the-hobbit-saga/?do=findComment&comment=686039","commentId":686039,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1346482979,"content":" I hoped we'd see some new eagles as well…but their main part takes place during the first hobbit expansion…so I guess we won't see any eagles…Hope Gwaihir, Meneldor and The Lord of The Eagles will be released sooner or later (hopefully not tactics since we have plenty)…As for \"On the Doorstep\" my bets for heroes are : Thranduil (Leadership or Lore), Balin (Spirit or Lore), Bard (not sure about him…if he'll be there than Tactics or Leadership) and maybe a second version of another dwarf (Bombur ?…) ore even Oin…Regarding other player cards I think we'll see more non-unique allies (perhaps silvan or dale…hopefully no more dwarves XD)…and a few attachments and events…not as much as in the first saga expansion I guess…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70282-what-to-expect-from-the-rest-of-the-hobbit-saga/?do=findComment&comment=686075","commentId":686075,"userName":"Ranger of the Force","timestamp":1346491707,"content":"Ever since seing the art for Gwaihir, I know i will get any pack he is in.  My hope is for the next Hobbit expansion.  To me, it doesn't make sense for Gwaihir or any of the other eagles yet to be released to be anything other than tactics given all thier brethren are tactics.  I am hoping he will be a hero.\n\nOn another note, Isn't Gwaihir the \"Lord of the Eagles?\" I am learning my LOTR lore, so I haven't filled in all the gaps.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70282-what-to-expect-from-the-rest-of-the-hobbit-saga/?do=findComment&comment=686095","commentId":686095,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1346497343,"content":"Ranger of the Force said:\n\nOn another note, Isn't Gwaihir the \"Lord of the Eagles?\" I am learning my LOTR lore, so I haven't filled in all the gaps. \n\n\n\nThorondor is (was) the Lord of the Eagles (his name literally means \"King of Eagles\".\n\nGwaihir (literally \"Windlord\"), a descendant of Thorondor, was the greatest and swiftest of the Eagles of the North at the end of the 3rd Age."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70282-what-to-expect-from-the-rest-of-the-hobbit-saga/?do=findComment&comment=686141","commentId":686141,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1346504078,"content":" The art for Gwaihir ? :0…where ?…I hope he'll be a hero as well…! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70282-what-to-expect-from-the-rest-of-the-hobbit-saga/?do=findComment&comment=686159","commentId":686159,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1346506824,"content":"check the thread \"Legolas in Second Hobbit set?\" (here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=703934 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=703934])\n\nHere's a direct link: http://jakemurray.deviantart.com/art/Gwaihir-King-of-the-Eagles-273664009 [http://jakemurray.deviantart.com/art/Gwaihir-King-of-the-Eagles-273664009]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70282-what-to-expect-from-the-rest-of-the-hobbit-saga/?do=findComment&comment=686391","commentId":686391,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1346560784,"content":" Awsome !
