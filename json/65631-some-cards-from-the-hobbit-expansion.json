I read it as if you were running both 3x but looking back I see what you meant.\n\n \n\nNot sure how often I'll mix Gandalfs, as they both have kind of specific uses. Original Gandalf is great to bounce down for his abilities but then doesn't stay around. New Gandalf is great for questing and then keeping out if you can deal with threat. I probably won't often mix because it's hard enough to find a Gandalf when you absolutely need him right now as it is, so having less than 3x copies of the one your deck needs could be bad.\n\nBut still, interesting options to consider."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65631-some-cards-from-the-hobbit-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=641675","commentId":641675,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1339086392,"content":"Yes, that seems right. A card should have a purpose and having less than three copies reduces the chances of using it at the right moment.\n\nI still think the original Gandalf is a great card, thematically and in terms of its function. But as I said I saw the trend of needing it less and less in my games. in the beginning of the existence of the game we always felt having Sneak Attack and Gandalf was the best thing that could happen in the game. Of course it is still a great combo indeed (and ever will) but I would often exclude Gandalf in a deck that was either not running Leadership or wasn't overflowing in resources. Now this Gandalf bring an entire new possibility. It is a truly exceptional ally if you can manage your threat well enough (which I feel may be very hard and nigh impossible without Spirit unless other spheres get their boost in threat reduction). Having an ally who can constantly quest for 4 and fight, is superb though beyond questioning."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65631-some-cards-from-the-hobbit-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=642208","commentId":642208,"userName":"Tritogenia","timestamp":1339191995,"content":" There was an earlier post that this Gandalf would work better with Word of Command.

Bilbo, Thorin and their company must avoid a trio of powerful trolls, shelter from storms and thundering giants, surviving an ambush goblins, fighting a pack of Wargs and a strange face creature known as Gollum in a riddle contest far below the surface. Each of the three scenarios in The Hobbit: For Mountains and Underground brings excitement and challenge. These scenarios should be played as much as experienced as they draw you into the incredible story this journey with a beginning, middle and end. In addition, scenarios can be combined to form a campaign that will allow you to relive the events depicted in the first half of the novel. And with the release later this year, a second box which will take events of the second half of The Hobbit, you can trace the whole of this fantastic journey. Meanwhile, players gain the benefits of capacity Unique Bilbo. Appearing in The Hobbit: For Mountains and Underground as a hero of the new sphere of influence: Baggins, Bilbo will join the adventure under the control of the first player. Which means that the first player can have up to four heroes, but the main actor of this extension is not a hero like other. As in the novel, the audacity and the spirit of Bilbo may save you from the worst situations. The scenarios contain innovative mechanical balance the combined efforts of the players with the central role of Bilbo. This one can not gain resources through card effects players, but each scenario offers ways to spend those that will accumulated. That Bilbo uses its resources to release the Dwarves bags of Trolls, he leads his companions through the ambushes Goblin, or uses his mind to solve puzzles, the use of its resources can have a major impact: the Players will have to choose wisely each expense. Rendezvous in a preview of next EdgeEnt.com for more information on resource use of Bilbo.\n\nTREASURES  The Hobbit: By Underground Mountains and renews the game The Lord of Rings, the Card Game in many ways. In addition to Bilbo Baggins and scenarios that closely follow the events of the first half of the novel, this extension gives us the first treasures! The treasures are new maps that represent players quelquesuns objects of the rarest and most expensive that your characters can find as they sail to Middle-earth. But players can not add these valuable items directly to their decks. To use a treasure card, players must first locate the in the scenario. It is only then that they \"unlock\" the possibility of using these cards later in the famous scenarios. Treasures increase the replayability of exciting scenarios Hobbit by rewarding players beyond mere victory over each quest. In addition, they establish a continuity in the countryside that unifies all the scenarios of the extension. We will disclose more information on these exciting new maps in another preview on our site.\n \n\nWHAT IS AN EXTENSION OF SAGA?\nWhile an extension of the classic Lord of the Rings, the game Cards creates new original adventures in Middle-earth, Extension of this saga gives us the chance to follow the exciting J.R.R. story imagined by Tolkien. The characters, enemies and scenarios Hobbit, By Mountains and Underground are directly learned from the first half of the novel and the second extension Saga, forthcoming normally during 2012, will transport players until the conclusion of the book. Scenarios Hobbit, Par Monts et Underground can be played by independently of each other or be joined to form a campaign offering greater immersion in the game world"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65631-some-cards-from-the-hobbit-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=644719","commentId":644719,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1339700369,"content":"Also, if you download that magazine as a PDF file, you can hilight all the text fields of the cards and export them.
