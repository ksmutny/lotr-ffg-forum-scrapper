I've also seen some of the other PoD products available for the same price from CCG Armory. But when it comes to PoD I'd just get it from the source. I don't think the shipping will be better elsewhere, and the price is hard to get lower."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52148-massing-at-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=520031","commentId":520031,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1314303169,"content":"That was the other question I forgot!

It'll be double that with shipping for me, but I haven't bought any of the on demand products yet, so I'm saving up products for a large order here :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
