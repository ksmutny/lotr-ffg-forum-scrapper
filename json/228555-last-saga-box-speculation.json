Will it be its own quest, or will it be combined with Mount Doom? Both options have potential problems.\n\n \n\nIf Morannon is a distinct quest (either before or after the Mount Doom quest), then it hurts the continuity that the developers have been emphasizing in campaign mode, where a saga box generally follows the same group of heroes. The desire to preserve that continuity was likely a significant factor in why the designers chose the battle with corsairs as the second quest in The Flame of the West, even though (as the announcement article mentions) that \"never played out on the foreground of The Return of the King.\" They might also have to include an extra Fellowship Aragorn, since all saga quests have fellowship heroes, Frodo wouldn't fit, and they don't assume players have earlier saga expansions (except for campaign mode). It would be interesting to have Mount Doom (likely including Gorgoroth) as the second quest, and the longer it takes to destroy the Ring, the longer players have to survive in the third quest (the battle of Morannon). This would feel like an anti-climactic conclusion, though. Also, any such arrangement would need to work well when the quests are played individually, while ideally feeling closely connected in campaign mode.\n\n \n\nIf, on the other hand, the battle of Morannon and Mont Doom are combined in one quest, there are a few complications. Perhaps something like Flies and Spiders would work, with one staging area for the Ringbearer and another for all the other players, maybe using two different encounter decks. However, the quest needs to be playable in true solo, so there needs to be an option to deal with either the battle or Mount Doom in an abstracted way. Flies and Spiders worked well in solo because the first player was doing the most interesting stuff, while the other players were treading water until the first player rejoined them. (Breaking of the Fellowship tweaked this formula: it worked decently well in solo, but was better with more than one player, where the other players could support the first player.) If the quest is designed so that the focus is on the Ringbearer in true solo, many players would be disappointed if the epic battle is abstracted.\n\n \n\nThey could also try something like Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim, with the Ringbearer in a separate area (like the Riddle area, and perhaps immune to player card effects), and some encounter cards that give players a choice: either make the battle more difficult, or do something (perhaps some form of test) that risks damaging the Ringbearer but can make progress towards destroying the Ring. If the designers choose this option, I would want them to allow players to switch heroes before this quest. Perhaps in campaign mode the first player would control Fellowship Aragorn (and technically also control the Ringbearer, but the Ringbearer's in his own area with special rules). This option would disrupt the continuity between saga quests a bit, since it wouldn't include a role for the heroes that have been supporting the Ringbearer (unless you teleport them to participate in the battle of Morannon), but it seems like a decent compromise.\n\n \n\nI like this last option, since the game does a better job of modelling an external struggle (like the battle of Morannon) than an internal struggle--which Frodo ultimately lost. Tolkien wrote about Frodo's failure in letter 192:\n\n> And surely it is a more significant and real event than a mere 'fairy-story' ending in which the hero is indomitable? ... In this case the cause (not the 'hero') was triumphant, because by the exercise of pity, mercy, and forgiveness of injury, a situation was produced in which all was redressed and disaster averted. Gandalf certainly foresaw this. [a reference to when he says to Frodo: \"Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.\"]\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Frodo deserved all honour because he spent every drop of his power of will and body, and that was just sufficient to bring him to the destined point, and no further. Few others, possibly no others of his time, would have got so far. The Other Power then took over: the Writer of the Story (by which I do not mean myself), 'that one ever-present Person who is never absent and never named' (as one critic has said).\n\n \n\nIt's tricky to try to recreate some of Tolkien's central themes in game form, since a cooperative game often becomes a challenging puzzle to solve. There can be moments of eucatastrophe, like revealing Eagle of the Misty Mountain when the situation seems hopeless in The Battle of Five Armies, but those tend to be exceptions. If the designers manage to design this quest (or these quests) so that Aragorn and companions can make life easier for the Rinbearer by making it more difficult for themselves, I'll be pretty happy. If they can somehow reflect that destroying the Ring is not simply a question of willpower or power gaming, that would be wonderful.\n\nEdited August 26, 2016 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228555-last-saga-box-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=2385555","commentId":2385555,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1472186485,"content":"I would love to see a Sam Ring-bearer.  They have left the design space open.  However, I don't know if they have really left space open for themselves in the format of the boxes.  A Sam Ring-bearer in this box would mean that players picking up only this box and the Core Set would have no Frodo Ring-bearer.  I think we'll either see both a Sam and a Frodo Ring-bearer in the last box (2 fellowship heroes), or only Frodo."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228555-last-saga-box-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=2385579","commentId":2385579,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1472189218,"content":"> I would love to see a Sam Ring-bearer.  They have left the design space open.  However, I don't know if they have really left space open for themselves in the format of the boxes.  A Sam Ring-bearer in this box would mean that players picking up only this box and the Core Set would have no Frodo Ring-bearer.  I think we'll either see both a Sam and a Frodo Ring-bearer in the last box (2 fellowship heroes), or only Frodo.\n\n \n\nThey could give us a two sided ring bearer with Frodo on one side and Sam on the other...."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228555-last-saga-box-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=2385684","commentId":2385684,"userName":"Crabble","timestamp":1472198583,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > I haven't read the Return of the King for like 8 years now, and I don't remember everything (and I just don't envoy the movies - sorry :/) but why Eomer?\n> > \n> > We just dont have a spirit version of Eomer.  We got a Tactics Theoden and Spirit Theoden, so why not add a spirit Eomer for Spirit Rohan?\n> > \n> >  \n> \n> also no Spirit Aragorn yet. i could see a Spirite Eomer, but here are my predictions:\n> \n> Fellowship Sam Gamgee\n> \n> Spirit Aragorn\n> \n> Leadership Eomer\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nThe three above + Ally Elladan and Elrohir is my guess and wish for this box :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228555-last-saga-box-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=2385735","commentId":2385735,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1472202279,"content":"So happy that so many others want new versions of Elrohir and Elladan as well.
