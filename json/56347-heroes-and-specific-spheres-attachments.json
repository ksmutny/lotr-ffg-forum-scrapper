While this is not based on anything currently in the ruling for this game, but the Game of Thrones card game has very similar cirumstances. For one the actual rulebook in both games share similar wording and do not make mention of this case. The FAQ says \"Any attachment that has a restriction is immediately discarded from play at any time this restriction is not met. Such restrictions are constant effects, and the attachment should be immediately discarded any time a restriction is not met.\"\n\nAgain, this doesn't pertain to LotR but at least it's the same game designer. I'm sure many will disagree but I would bet the farm on this being correct for this game as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56347-heroes-and-specific-spheres-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=556688","commentId":556688,"userName":"The Strolling Bones","timestamp":1321456728,"content":"I ran into a similar problem when a new player I was teaching the game to used A Light in the Dark to send a Cave Troll who had been Forest Snared back to the staging area.

Some rules seem to be uneccessarily overcomplicated.\n\n \n\nI think we can hopefully confirm clearly the ability of characters to belong to multiple spheres by benifit of the resource icons. The key facet you dint type from the hero card anatomy in the rule book is the plural reference for spheres.\n\n\"They also indicate to which sphere(s) the hero card itself belongs\"\n\nWith the talk of dual sphere heros in the future this will become even more prevalent I presume.\n\nWIth regards to Burning Brand I would agree to statements above with the conclusion that; the required on the card is only stated for attachment (not for control, or for triggering action), and there in no mechanic stated that requires the player to discard attachments tor to continuously check heros sphere of influence.\n\n \n\nAs ever all these ideas can be re interpretated, with the increase of multi sphere game play this may be an aspect FFG could nail down for us in principal.\n\nI can even imagine attachments in the future that would require a certain sphere to activate and these I feel should also remain attached to a hero in the situation we are discusing. I certainly wouldnt like to see the requirement to discard a song through a treachery or shadow effect, for example, and then lose additional attachments that I have paid resource for when I can potenially play a new song.\n\nWhile singing 'Eye of the Tiger' (Song of Battle) a Hero of any sphere can wield mighty tactics only weapons! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56347-heroes-and-specific-spheres-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=557318","commentId":557318,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1321601489,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\nI see.

Some rules seem to be uneccessarily overcomplicated.\n\nI didn't find this to be complicated at all. In fact, I was playing like this before I read that part of the rulebook because it just makes most sense to me.\n\nAnyway, the \"found only on hero cards\" part even makes sense. They ARE found only on hero cards. No other card uses resource icons. That doesn't mean no cards can reference them.\n\nThe context of this whole thing is an explanation of each part of a card. It's a numbered list of all the parts of a card with explanations. In this context, yes these are only found on hero cards. No other card type in the game uses a resource icon. The songs may have the icon printed on them, but they don't \"have\" a resource icon (and definitely not in the location or with the usage referenced by the number \"9\" in terms of the card anatomy on those pages). They have an effect which grants a resource icon to a hero card, which is perfectly in line with the rules... the hero card is still the only card with resource icons."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56347-heroes-and-specific-spheres-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=561644","commentId":561644,"userName":"Shiv@n","timestamp":1322568322,"content":"Finally got an answer :\n\n\"Attachments only check the requirements when played.
