On one hand he basically puts more leadership weenies into play, but on the other hand I don't like the fact that he is a weenie himself. I would've liked better a Gondor leadership ally with 2 or more strength, to have a good attacker in the Leadership Gondor deck with Boromir, IMO that's something that deck lacks, but I still think he works well. Also Defender of the Naith is going to die the first attack and can't even quest. What's its purpose?\n\n \n\nThe rest of the cards though are amazing, especially O Lorien! and Lembas.

He will need to be able to generate enough attack strength to finish off enemies first attack to make it a reliable strategy for a non engagement deck. I'm talking strictly solo here.\n\nDunhere on the other hand can use any readying effects and continue to hammer away at enemies in the stating area while wielding 2 spears for 7 attack. So, A deck built around Haldir and non engagement is going to have to rely a lot more on the non- engagement cards like Ranger Spikes, and some of the other events that keep enemies in the staging area longer.

So, there you have it. Elrond's Counsel and Galadhrim's Greeting and your good to go. Although if you read my post before this, I think this type of deck might struggle a bit more than the Dunhere model, although having access to lore opens up some different possibilities which might make up for it.

Can't wait to give the player cards and scenario a go. With all the traits Haldir was given he can certainly fit in a lot of different kinds of decks (I was worried he would be pigeon-holed into the silvan archetype). His ability may not always be useful but there is certainly a gap that he fills for a lower threat lore hero especially with that 3 attack and ranged! While he is certainly a wonderful fit in a ranger deck (much better than Faramir is anyway) I think I'll be trying him first with Celeborn and spirit Glorfindel to make use of all the new silvan toys in this pack. The leadership attachment makes me much more comfortable not relying on Elrond to pay for the allies in a tri-sphere deck and the Lembas bread is also a nice alternative method of healing (compared to the unthematic steward of healing and the expensive and fragile daughter of the nimrodel). The neutral naith ally doesn't seem super useful but I'll give it a try too. The deck will pair well with a tactics focused deck especially for defense which seems to be silvan a biggest weakness and all the other great attachments like rivendell blade and elven mail. Legolas will be an obvious choice along and then I could either stay entirely elven with Elrohir and Elladan or go with Beregond for my primary defender then have a host of options for the 3rd: Bard or Brand (the latter may combo especially well with Haldir) for some further ranged support which will also help with Rumil and the new tactics event. Or maybe Beorn for the\n\nbig body and emergency sentinel. Keeping mono tactics would allow me to feasibly play eagles and run Gwaihir which would be fun or I could splash leadership and use Aragorn who could contribute in any phase (and even receive a rivendell now which id use), Balin for some low cost questingn and shadow support, or Sam for the low threat willpower.

I also agree about losing out in sentinel.\n\n \n\nIf it weren't for Celeborn's boost, he'd be like Orthanc Guard except more expensive and unable to quest. At least with the boost he's able to quest for one round, then he readies and is available to defend with 3 defense. After that though, he's even worse than Orthanc Guard because he can't quest, so he'd only ready after defending (assuming he doesn't die) and can contribute 1 attack. The only thing that makes him slightly better than Orthanc guard is that he has Sentinel.\n\n \n\nI think we need to realize, though, that most enemies (not an overwhelming majority, but still a majority) still have 3 or less attack, meaning we can still get use out of this guy. Obviously, some shadows can end up killing him anyway, but in general, as an ally, it's not terrible for him to die. The issue is really that there are better defenders out there, especially for his cost.\n\n \n\nGuthlaf can defend just as well, will have 1 permanent willpower, and will cost 1 less if you're using the right heroes. Defender of Rammas has 4 defense for 2 cost. As I mentioned, Orthanc Guard is comparable and costs less. Emery has better stats and can come into play for free. Watcher of the Bruinen is comparable and cheaper. Even White Tower Watchman is a better defender. Most of those don't have sentinel, but if you can only get 1 or 2 blocks out of the Defender of the Naith, then the 3 resources may not be worth it for defending other players. In general, though should be able to get their own chump blockers more easily.\n\nEdited August 12, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113059-trouble-in-tharbad-spoilers-at-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=1196776","commentId":1196776,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1407914808,"content":"Defender of Naith costs 3 because he's:\n\n1) neutral;\n\n2) silvan;\n\n3) sentinel.\n\n \n\nWith O Lorien, he technically costs 2.

The treachery doesn't seem so bad at first glance but upon closer inspection it seems that the enemy affected makes an attack not just against the first player but actually against Nalir which means that it is his defense and hit points the attack will be affecting and if he dies you lose the quest.\n\nNow he only has 2 defense and 3 hit points so if you have a healer out and he takes two damage and only has 1 hit point left you can easily heal him back to full with one heal. However for the attack itself he can take on an attack which has attack power of 4 maximum which blocks 2 and puts him to 1 health, five attack power or higher and hes one dead dwarf and the quest is failed. Lets have a look at the various enemies that are actually featured in this quest and what would happen if they are indeed the enemy with the highest attack in staging and what their attack against Nalir would mean:\n\nBellach (Trouble in Tharbad): This unique enemy has 5 attack so with or without a shadow effect his attack from Get that Dwarf! would instantly kill Nalir and end the quest.....\n\nSpy From Mordor (Trouble in Tharbad): This enemy has 3 attack which means that Nalir will defend 2 of that and only take 1 damage. Should you get a shadow card that boosts attack it will do 2 damage intead, now as long as your threat is above 20 there are NO SHADOW CARDS in this quest that give more than +1 attack, there are some that let the enemy attack again etc but nothing that gives more than +1 attack so long as your threat is over 20. This means as long as your threat is over 20 Nalir can safety take an attack from a Spy from Mordor and survive on 1 health.\n\nBellach's Marauder (Trouble in Tharbad): This nasty enemy also has 5 attack like its master Bellach so would instantly kill Nalir from Get that Dwarf! whether it gets a shadow effect/boost or not.\n\nOrc Skirmisher (Misty Mountain Orcs): The skirmisher has an attack of 4 which means Nalir's defense stops 2 and he takes 2 which leaves him on only 1 hitpoint. Therefore so long as the shadow card dealt has no effect he can JUST survive an attack from this enemy from Get that Dwarf. If the shadow card gives even +1 attack and you can't cancel it with a hasty stroke or something else then he is dead and you lose the quest.\n\nOrc Hunter (Misty Mountain Orcs): This guy is more or less the same as the Spies from Mordor and has 3 attack so would only do 1 damage/2 if a shadow card that gives +1 attack is revealed.\n\nOrc Hound (Misty Mountain Orcs): The Orc Hound is the only enemy in the deck that Nalir can defend against and potentially take no damage, his 2 defense stopping the 2 attack power. Should the hound get a shadow card giving it one attack Nalir will just take the one damage. The one other thing however is that when engaged this enemy forces the player to exhaust a character, if you randomly had everyone exhausted except nalir you would have to exhaust him and the attack would be undefended which would do 2 damage to him or if there was a shadow effect giving +1 attack as well it would kill Nalir. I don't really see this ever happening as I really don't see anyone not leaving a single character for defense/emergencies except for Nalir but just wanted to state it is a possibility.\n\n \n\nOne last thing to note is the other treachery card \"Cornered\". It gives you a choice between removing a time counter or giving all enemies in staging +1 attack and -20 engagement cost. Should this card come out during staging and you choose to give all enemies higher attack values and then Get that Dwarf is subsequently revealed as the 2nd (or if playing with more than two the third or fourth) encounter card during staging you are more or less screwed....\n\n \n\nI think its safe to say even if just to protect against Get that Dwarf; enemies should definitely NOT be left in the staging area with this quest. So long as you are able take those fools on, don't leave them in staging, especially not if they have a high attack value, they could very well (due to a single treachery) end the game for you instantly! Bellach and his Marauding Orcs kill Nalir in one hit and the Orc Skirmisher has a pretty decent chance of killing him straight up as well.\n\nAnother way around this is to simply keep a copy of A Test of Will in your hand especially for this treachery or to run Eleanor for this quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113059-trouble-in-tharbad-spoilers-at-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=1196921","commentId":1196921,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1407920076,"content":"You know you can declare defenders against those aimed attacks?

Even though the first player controls 3 other heroes, any undefended damage from this attack must be applied to Bilbo Baggins. Because Bilbo is already exhausted from committing to the quest, he cannot exhaust to defend himself and will be killed if the attack is undefended. Knowing this, the first player chooses to exhaust one of his ready characters, Bombur, to declare him as the defender for this attack. At this point, the attack resolves as normal and any damage from the attack is applied to Bombur."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113059-trouble-in-tharbad-spoilers-at-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=1197297","commentId":1197297,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1407940552,"content":"Someone stated earlier they \"hate attachments for only one character\" and were bemoaning the fact that Warden of Arnor was \"only\" for Idraen - and yet, here comes the next hero - Haldir - and he's also a scout!
