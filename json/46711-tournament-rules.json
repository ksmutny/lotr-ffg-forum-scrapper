Classic, everyone brings a deck, paired of with random people in games per 'table' everyone gets score for the table each round, and then add up several rounds worth of scores, presume you would have to relax the unique rules though (especially for heroes).\n\n2.  Team events, you build deck in teams and play through several scenarios and determine order by team results.\n\nThoughts?\n\nOnly bought the game yesterday and not had chance to play yet, but was just wondering if you could do tournaments at local games club.\n\nWhich of the above would seem like the best option (or any other ideas?)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46711-tournament-rules/?do=findComment&comment=467583","commentId":467583,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1305226268,"content":"The plan FFG has let us know about for the tourneys is for the tourneys to be team based, 2 players, against a unique scenario for the tourney."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46711-tournament-rules/?do=findComment&comment=467839","commentId":467839,"userName":"rhino1976","timestamp":1305270972,"content":"Ok sounds interesting, when/where was that announced?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46711-tournament-rules/?do=findComment&comment=467900","commentId":467900,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1305277201,"content":"It was quite a while ago.
