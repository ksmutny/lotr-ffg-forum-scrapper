I would try and get a hold of The Road Darkens now (you can buy it from FFG's website here [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/products/the-road-darkens/] or even better from your LGS) while they are still available so that you have that one to go with the others when they are reprinted.\n\nEdited October 6, 2018 by Stewart777"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284065-reprint-of-saga/?do=findComment&comment=3494496","commentId":3494496,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1538840928,"content":"Usually all LotR LCG products are reprinted, it's just a matter of time.
