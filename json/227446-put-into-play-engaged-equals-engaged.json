Bellator Sardel's answer is entirely correct: no matter how it happens, any time an enemy ends up engaged with you when it was not previously engaged with you, all the \"you engaged an enemy\" and \"an enemy engaged you\" triggers will fire. Doesn't matter if the enemy came from the staging area, the discard pile, the victory display, or even out-of-play. If it was set aside at the start of the quest, and when it comes into play it immediately engages the first player, then that will trigger Ranger of Cardolan. If you searched the deck for it and put it into play engaged with you, that will trigger Ranger of Cardolan. If you defeated an enemy with victory points before so it was in the victory display, but a Treachery just brought it back into play engaged with you, that will trigger Ranger of Cardolan."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227446-put-into-play-engaged-equals-engaged/?do=findComment&comment=2360866","commentId":2360866,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1470973632,"content":"So you're saying with both in an opening hand, it's totally possible to start the game with 2 fairly decent allies for 1 resource?

Player 1 has Mablung (RM 84) and wishes to trigger his Response effect, but he cannot because he has not actually engaged Durin’s Bane.
