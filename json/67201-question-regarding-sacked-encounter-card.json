Have a couple of questions regarding the \"Sacked\" encounter card. \n\n \n\n1) I am pretty sure I already know the answer to this, but will Miner of the Iron Hills remove this from a hero? I would think that it would but I wasn't 100% certain due to the \"cannot be canceled\" notation. \n\n \n\nand 2) How DO you remove this card? I mean, there must be a way for non-lore decks to take care of this. I did see a post a while ago (cannot find now--sorry) that mentioned that it is removed when you kill an enemy w/ the \"troll\" keyword but I can't find that notation on either the Rule insert or the card itself (or, for that matter, on the troll cards).

You just can't cancel it (with Eleanor, perhaps) at the point at which it comes out of the encounter deck and becomes an attachment."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67201-question-regarding-sacked-encounter-card/?do=findComment&comment=655507","commentId":655507,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1341786969,"content":" Thanks for the reply :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nAny idea about question #2--killing a troll to remove sacked?
