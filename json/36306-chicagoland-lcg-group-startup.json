If anyone is interested in getting on the mailing list so we can get this going post here and email me your info so we can include you. If there is enough interest I would be more than happy to set up a monthly Tourney for the LCGs as well. The more interest the sooner we can get it going!! Hope to hear from all you Chicago people soon and let IL represent!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/36306-chicagoland-lcg-group-startup/?do=findComment&comment=366601","commentId":366601,"userName":"thefoehammer","timestamp":1285840535,"content":"I am definitely interested.
