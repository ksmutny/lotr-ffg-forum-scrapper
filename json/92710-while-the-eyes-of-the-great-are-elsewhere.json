The recurring theme of triggering bonus effects when engaging an enemy whose engagement cost is higher than your threat is very effective, both from a thematic and gameplay perspective. This is in effect an alternate way to trigger a hobbit-style \"secrecy bonus\", in many ways superior to the original secrecy mechanic. This realization made me wonder whether it might be possible to revitalize the existing secrecy cards along these lines. How about an event or attachment that enables the secrecy discount, conditional on either exclusively using hobbit heroes OR having less threat than the lowest engagement cost enemy in play?\n\nFor example:\nSwift and Silent\nAttachment, Cost: 0\nAttach to a hobbit hero. If each of your heroes has the hobbit trait, you may reduce the cost to play cards with the secrecy keyword by the indicated amount, regardless of your current threat level.\n\"[Hobbits] possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by...\"\n-The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nEyes of the Great Are Elsewhere\nEvent, Cost: 0\nIf your current threat is less than the lowest engagement cost of any enemy in play, for the rest of the round you may reduce the cost to play cards with the secrecy keyword by the indicated amount, regardless of your current threat level. If no enemies currently in play, the lowest engagement cost is considered to be 50.\n\"Such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.\"\n-Elrond, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nEdited October 27, 2013 by Titanium"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92710-while-the-eyes-of-the-great-are-elsewhere/?do=findComment&comment=897528","commentId":897528,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1382900774,"content":"i like those. i love secrecy and even though the black rider box is clearly centered around low hobbit threat i was dissapointed to not see any real secrecy cards\n\ni hope that ffg dont give up on the mechanic\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92710-while-the-eyes-of-the-great-are-elsewhere/?do=findComment&comment=897983","commentId":897983,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1382964017,"content":"Nice card propositions, including sweet source text, nice job! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Me, too, I love the secrecy trait and hope we will some more cards supporting it and the combination with hobbits woould just be awesome!"}]}
