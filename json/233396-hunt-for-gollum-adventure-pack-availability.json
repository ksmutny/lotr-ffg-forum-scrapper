You can set a pricewatch on any amazon item there. Once the price goes below the target you set, it will alert you.I often manage to get things at half price this way. Some sales are realy only a day and you can find them without having to actually check yourself.\n\nI'm sure camelcamel sells off my data but whatever I get to buy stuff on discount and I can still decide not to do it if I've bough too much already."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233396-hunt-for-gollum-adventure-pack-availability/?do=findComment&comment=2814802","commentId":2814802,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1496249946,"content":"My FLGS for Lord of the Rings has a high success rate with helping people find packs.
