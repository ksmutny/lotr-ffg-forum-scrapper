You got feint yoy got Hama and now just draw cards and vuala Balrog is not a problem anymore at all! Too powerful!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77788-durins-bane-a-light-in-the-dark-that-work/?do=findComment&comment=753800","commentId":753800,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1359178834,"content":"If there weren't event cards through which Durin's Bane gets additional attacks. And if there wasn't the problem that it's not unlikely that you won't get Feint in your hand before you die. In other words: Hama-Lock is a stratgey that will likely win you the game once you have it, but as it is based on the possession of a single card it's not very reliable, especially if you play with only one core set like me. There are decks that work way better against this scenario.\n\nAnyway, I prefer a scenario which might be broken by a special combo, but is otherwise clever designed and enjoyable. No one forces you to play Hama-Lock in SaF."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77788-durins-bane-a-light-in-the-dark-that-work/?do=findComment&comment=779116","commentId":779116,"userName":"Highland Shade","timestamp":1364509537,"content":"The newest FAQ/Errata from Feb 27th changes the wording on \"Feint\" to read \"Choose an enemy engaged with a player.

But Hama lock is still perfectly work in solo game……."}]}
