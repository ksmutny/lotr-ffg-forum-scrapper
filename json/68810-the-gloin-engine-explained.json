I have to get a bit used to your playstyle and that you're not playing for a good result.

You can't always rely on Sneak/Gandalf in your starting hand!)\n\n \n\nOh, and there has been one mistake at 09:22. You should have attached Striking Tentacle to Gléowine, not Grasping Tentacle. In this game it made no difference as you would have killed Grasping Tentacle anyway."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68810-the-gloin-engine-explained/?do=findComment&comment=671080","commentId":671080,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1344510581,"content":"Ooph, those tentacle cards confuse the hell out of me. So, for the grasping tentacle, the rules are:\n\n \n\nForced: When Grasping Tentacle is attacked, discard the top card of the encounter deck. If that card has a shadow effect or is a Tentacle enemy, attach this card to an attacking character as a Tentacle attachment with the text: \"Attached character's [Attack] and [Defense] are reduced to 0.\" \n\n \n\nSo, which card gets attached? I've always read it, perhaps too literally, that the defending Grasping Tentacle is attached, because the other card is referred to as 'that card' and then you attach 'this card', which I took to mean the Grasping Tentacle. But now I'm not so sure. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68810-the-gloin-engine-explained/?do=findComment&comment=671082","commentId":671082,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1344510679,"content":" Heh, and a very nice deck, Plueschi.

I don't like to build a deck for just one scenario, but (hypothetically) for all scenarios. So the Watcher can screw me over pretty quickly with those Striking Tentacles. On the other hand, once I got a Citadel Plate or Boots from Erebor, the Watcher actually becomes pretty easy I guess.\n\nBut I digress, glad you like it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68810-the-gloin-engine-explained/?do=findComment&comment=671093","commentId":671093,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1344511060,"content":"monkeyrama said:\n\nSo, which card gets attached?

(but is able to both quest and to travel to distant locations…?)\n\nBut so does mine, as the Grasping Tentacle manages to grasp one of its attackers, making him/her useless for the rest of the fight while the tentacle is still able to strikeat the other attackers , using his victim as a weapon.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68810-the-gloin-engine-explained/?do=findComment&comment=671229","commentId":671229,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1344524808,"content":"There is was mistake with Striking tentacle attack.\n\nWhen striking tentacle attach you should discard top card of the encounter deck(to check it out undefended or not) but BEFORE you Declare a defender!\n\nCose attack is: Choose enemies who is attack then declare defender and so on.
