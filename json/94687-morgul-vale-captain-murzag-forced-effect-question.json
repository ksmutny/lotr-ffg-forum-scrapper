I missed it too for my first couple play-throughs...just think of it as another excuse to play the quest again though! I finally got my first \"real\" win with it now, resolving the when revealed effects and such.

Not sure if you like it:\n\n \n\n> Hi Jörg,\n> Since \"reveal and add to the staging area\" is just long-hand for \"reveal\" we've mostly stopped using \"and add to the staging area\" in order to save space and allow room for more effects or flavor text. Therefore, Murzag's Forced effect works the same as any other effect that forces players to reveal cards from the encounter deck: resolve any \"when revealed\" effects and keywords, then resolve the staging of that card. If it is a treachery card, it is discarded after resolving its effects. If it is a location, add it to the staging area. If it is an enemy, Murzag's ability instructs the defending player to put it into play engaged with him instead of adding it to the staging area. That enemy will make an attack since it is still the \"resolve enemy attacks\" part of the combat phase, but it will not be dealt a shadow card.\n> Hope you're enjoying the conclusion of the Against the Shadow cycle!\n> Caleb\n\n \n\n<_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94687-morgul-vale-captain-murzag-forced-effect-question/?do=findComment&comment=926844","commentId":926844,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1386618521,"content":"This is rough for the solo player.
