He may be better with the hobbit cards in the black riders.....except we will get a new lore version of the character who appears monumentally better. The only way I can envision using him is if the unknown spirit hobbit in black riders is even worse than he is\n\nDunhere I think used to be decent but is fading into obsoleteness. Encounter deck power creep has assured he will only damage the frailest of enemies and newer cards like hands upon the bow, ithilien pit, great yew bow, hail of stones and ranger bow have given us new options to attack the staging areas without taking up a hero roster spot\n\nby far the most useless IMO is Brand son of Bain. At least FFG had the respect to place such a situational ability on such an obscure hero with bad art (really tho, what's up with his face?). I play mostly solo where he is completely useless, but even in multiplayer games I think Legolas or Bard would be my tactics ranged characters of choice. Even in multiplayer he's not awesome unless you are the first player since otherwise whomever your playing with might not have any use for the extra hero action\n\nEdited August 13, 2013 by Pharmboys2013"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88413-what-is-the-worst-and-most-useless-hero-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=838989","commentId":838989,"userName":"Ithilien Ranger","timestamp":1376424751,"content":"My vote goes to Brand son of Bain.

He might just be the one hero who feels the most heroic out of the bunch. In the early rounds, he can swallow some attacks before you get your other defenders buffed up. His attack bonus will rid yourself of an enemy practically every round. Including Beorn my decks allowed me to defeat Journey along the Anduin despite two Hill Trolls in the first round. In battle quests, Beorn is superb!\n\nHis downfall is the immunity to player cards, of course. But keep in mind that Dori and Landroval actually work with him (Dori targets the damage, not Beorn; and Landroval targets Beorn while the card is out of play, and thus not immune)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88413-what-is-the-worst-and-most-useless-hero-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=839059","commentId":839059,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1376428478,"content":"1.

On the surface she does like pretty dull i will admit, but in practice i think she fares far better.  Maybe its just because I've been making a lot of mono-lore decks (or very low threat lore decks with spirit Glorfindel) recently because of the ranger cards, but i almost always find a place for her there.  While not excellent at either shes a decent quester or attacker and if playing a scenario with archery she can sponge it up if you're playing with silvan tracker.  And while at best a -3, i think the starting threat assist helps when pairing her with another high hero like Strider, Elrond, or even Faramir.  While i'm sure you could have already assumed these things, I still encourage you to give her a try.\n\n \n\nWouldnt be suprised if she is replaced with Pippin after the black riders release although.  If substituted for her he only provides 1 less point of threat relief but still has 2 other abilities that can come into play.  Combine the two however and its very easy to have a mono-lore hero line up right around the ~20 threshold\n\nEdited August 13, 2013 by Pharmboys2013"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88413-what-is-the-worst-and-most-useless-hero-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=839210","commentId":839210,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1376438819,"content":"I always use Brand in solo mono tactics decks.

I was beginning to feel a bit self conscious :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nBeing called out as the most useless hero ever does not feel so good. In all seriousness, for anyone who thinks that Beorn is the most useless hero ever, I encourage you to try him in Massing at Osgiliath, Peril in Pelargir or Into Ithilien. When you build the right deck around him, Beorn is literally *and* figuratively a beast. Dori or Landroval can more or less mitigate the fact that he cannot be healed, and sentinel + not exhausting to defend is an amazing combination of abilities.\n\n \n\nI have to agree with Dain (thanks for not voting me off the island, Matthew!) on this one. As it stands right now, Pippin is just not a worthwhile card. Even if you are running all Hobbit heroes (your stats will be terrible, btw) so that he actually has an ability, the ability itself is expensive and counter-productive. Raising your threat to fill the staging areas with enemies, none of which you have a means to kill, is not my idea of a good time. Who knows, maybe with all of the Hobbit love FFG is about to give in the upcoming Saga Expansion, he may end up being worth playing. If they print a Hobbit hero that lowers a players threat, but only if you control all hobbit heroes, then maybe Pippin will be viable.

face, etc are all going to influence any choices.\n\n \n\nI do LIKE the fact that it's hard for us all to point at a SINGLE hero and agree \"THEY ARE THE WORST!!!\"  It speaks to the balance and options in the game.  I think it's a lot easier to point at certain heros as the best (*cough*glorfindel*cough*dain*cough*etc*cough)...\n\nWith that being said, I play mostly solo.  So Brand is useless to me for the most part.  Have never actually used him.  But I can see that he would be stellar for regular use in multiplayer (readying actions cannot be overlooked!).\n\nBilbo is another one I have a hard time with.  He is actually BETTER in solo play (since you always get the benefit of the extra card), but his usefulness severely lessens with every other person that sits down at the table.  And his threat cost is HORRIBLE.  Even for solo play.  And even moreso in multiplayer where you still eat his threat cost, but don't get his benefit as often.  Still, card draw is king.\n\n \n\nI hate to point out the same new character that everyone else is mentioning, but the current Pippin seems like it started off on the wrong foot.  Limited ability to use him with other Hobbits (since there are only 2 others that he needs to have any impact), one is the aforementioned over-priced Bilbo.  And while his ability will perhaps become more useful in the future as we see more Hobbit cards come out, he will already have another version of himself.  Just bad timing really."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88413-what-is-the-worst-and-most-useless-hero-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=840062","commentId":840062,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1376513493,"content":"Indeed,

Faramir is a Lore Hero, that alone is great, but he also has a decent threat to hide in secrecy decks (and spike everyone that comes his way + Great Yew Bow if in conjunction with a Tactics hero, like... Legolas? Thalin? dunno) and we have a good amount of threat reduction for Lore already; sure, if coupled with Mirlonde he also gains a couple of turns but... yeah, no. His whoop 5HP is also very ridiculous(ly great).\n\n \n\nFatty, on the other hand, needs to exhaust to use his ability (always ALWAYS something bad), but he is just 7 threat, and you chose the freaking enemy to be 'nullified'. He is Spirit... Threat reduction is your schtick. So, why the hell would that be bad? In multiplayer games he is golden, in solo, he can be as good as long as you have good questers OR ways to deal with locations. His 3HP is expected to a Hobbit, but again, Bill the pony was spoiled at the same place. Also, remember he is Spirit? HE IS FREAKING SPIRIT. I don't believe I need to say why that is a good thing, but still: Threat reduction, ridiculously powerful allies, excellent questers (most quests have that as its main objective: RUN LIKE HELL), ready-abilities, canceling effects... Well, you probably get the picture.\n\n \n\nAnd to add insult to injury: I don't think Caldara is ALL that bad.
