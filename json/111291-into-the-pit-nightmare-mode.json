Not as bad as \"easy\" mode... but still \"nightmare\" is misleading.\n\n \n\nThe decks are not about making it harder. Though this might have been the initial idea behind it. After the CORE set packs there has been a growing trend in the nightmare packs to focus on FIXING the quest. Not just making it harder. They update it so it is more in sync with the power level of the pool and often make changes that make the quest narrative stronger. They are just updates plane and simple.. better versions. Being harder is just a side effect, and man are the nightmare versions better.\n\n \n\nKhaz and Darowdelf have some of the best quests ever printed, some of the best player cards... those packs were just gold. Personally I am looking forward for The Watcher in the Water.\n\n \n\nAs for pit itself... just a fantastic quest. The new mechanisms on the torch are just so thematically awesome. The torch burning out, the party entering a cavernous dark location and getting ambushed by the lurkers, the thing that dwells waiting for that last flickering ember of the light to fade away... just awesome and this quest was ALWAYS awesome to begin with.\n\nEdited July 20, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111291-into-the-pit-nightmare-mode/?do=findComment&comment=1163004","commentId":1163004,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1405877167,"content":"I love the Nightmare Khazad Dum quests so far.
