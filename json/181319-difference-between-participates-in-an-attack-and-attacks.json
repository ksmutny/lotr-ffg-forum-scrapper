Either way, the character is participating. The reason they didn't just say \"attack\" is because they wanted it to be very clear that the ability also worked if they were joining another character's attack. Also, let's say they just said \"kill an enemy\". If they said that than attack with 3 participants might be confusing because people might ask which of the 3 actually killed the enemy. By phrasing it the way they did they avoided that confusion.
