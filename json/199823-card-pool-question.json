I do own nearly every deluxe/saga expansion (except the Angmar-Cycle) so far. So I just wanted to ask you guys from what card pool do you build your decks, when playing a specific cycle or saga expansion.\n\n \n\nWhen we started playing, we did build the card pool this way:\n\n \n\nPlaying: Core + Mirkwood\n\nCard Pool: Core + Mirkwood\n\n \n\nPlaying: Khazad-dum + Dwarrowdelf\n\nCard Pool: Core + Mirkwood + Khazad-dum + Dwarrowdelf\n\n \n\nPlaying: Heirs of Numenor + Against the Shadow\n\nCard Pool: Core + Mirkwood + Khazad-dum + Dwarrowdelf + Heirs of Numenor + Against the Shadow\n\n \n\n... and so on ...\n\n \n\nBut we found out that the card pool is getting very big and the deckbuilding process could take a while. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I thought of another approach, that uses only Core Set, the deluxe expansion and the Adventure packs of the matching cycle. But I am not sure if I am cutting the available cards to much, so that the quests would be too hard to complete.\n\n \n\nAnd what are you doing on saga expansion. I know there is a card pool recommendation in the rules. But if I got that right, you should only use Core Set + Saga Expansion. In this case the card pool is a bit too small, I think.\n\n \n\nI just wanted to ask how you build your card pool. If everyone is doing it like us, we should find a way to speed up deckbuilding. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\nBest regards,\n\nSlimShady"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199823-card-pool-question/?do=findComment&comment=2004005","commentId":2004005,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1453371755,"content":"No limits. No mercy.\n\n \n\nBut I don't play non-thematic decks, so the pool for each one is fairly small."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199823-card-pool-question/?do=findComment&comment=2004105","commentId":2004105,"userName":"CommanderDave","timestamp":1453379352,"content":"Yeah, I restrict myself to thematic or faction specific builds, so it makes deck-building much faster. When looking at adventure packs that I don't yet own, I buy the ones that improve my existing, enjoyable thematic decks. Silvan and Noldor cards make the pack a must buy, even if I don't get to the quest until weeks later."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199823-card-pool-question/?do=findComment&comment=2004135","commentId":2004135,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1453381378,"content":"I play with everything I have, because :\n\n1- I play nightmare quests 75 % of the time\n2- I paid for all those shiny cards, so..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199823-card-pool-question/?do=findComment&comment=2004158","commentId":2004158,"userName":"webslinger9","timestamp":1453382634,"content":"If you want to keep it mostly in cycle, use Core + Deluxe + Cycle, and then allow each deck to use a few cards from another cycle. Say, 6 cards in total can be from other cycles. This means that you could pull a Gondorian Shield, Vilya, or other key card that a particular hero might need. Unless you're also not using the entire hero pool, in which case, good luck!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199823-card-pool-question/?do=findComment&comment=2004230","commentId":2004230,"userName":"mewmartigan","timestamp":1453384841,"content":"I play with every card I have however I'm relatively new and have only bought up through Dwarrowdelf. So technically I am only playing quests using the deluxe and AP that were released at that time.\n\n \n\nOnce my collection grows, I will probably just use everything that is available. I understand that some OP cards make earlier quests easy but I like trying to build thematic decks so I aim for that.\n\n \n\nI think it would be cool if FFG released a \"campaign mode\" set with boons/burdens, etc for some of the older APs. The Dwarrowdelf APs seem to follow a loose story so a campaign mode would be neat and then you might need some newer OP cards to get through."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199823-card-pool-question/?do=findComment&comment=2007477","commentId":2007477,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1453493570,"content":"I ply with everything, but I play theme decks which restricts my cardpool a bit. I'm not super-strict though. If I can find a way to explain away x elf and y dwarf might be palling around together I'm good. I just won't go to the extent of crowning Dain the Steward of Gondor, etc. "}]}
