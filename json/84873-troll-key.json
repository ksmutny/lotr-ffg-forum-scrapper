If Troll Key is unattached and in the\nstaging area, attach it to a Troll enemy, if able.'\"\n\nSo when the key or purse is revealed on stage 1, just put it in the staging area.  When you get to stage 2 you can attach it to a troll.  You won't be able to claim it until stage 2 when you damage the troll (or, for the purse, defeat it)."}]}
