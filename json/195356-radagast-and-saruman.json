Thematically it’s a little wonky as we’ve already seen him as an enemy (though we do have an ally so…) but my real gripe is that I do not like unique player cards that duplicate encounter cards. I get that it kind of has to happen in the Saga expansions but beyond there I would be quite happy to never see it again. It’s no big deal for those that purpose-build decks for a given scenario but for those that try to build a single or set of decks for the whole game it can be a real pain.\n\n \n\nWould love to see a new Radagast though. Hero or Ally. For Ally I think he could slot pretty well into the Neutral slot for the Lore-Elrond/Leadership-Galadriel, 3-cost, discard at end of round ally. Something like: [3-cost], 3/2/2/4. At the end of the round, discard Radagast from play. Response: After Radagast enters play, choose one: Reduce the cost of the next Creature, Mount or Eagle card you play this turn by 2, place 2 progress on any location, or heal all damage from one ally.\n\n \n\nNow for the Hero…the obvious ability would be something along the lines of giving a discount to Creature cards but I would rather do something we haven’t seen as much of. And Radagast is an Istari so he should feel powerful (despite what Peter Jackson thinks), but in a very different way than Gandalf or Saruman.\n\n \n\nWhat about something like: Neutral Hero. [11-threat cost], 3/2/2/4. Resources from Radagast’s resource pool may be used to pay costs for any Creature, Mount or Eagle cards. Action: Exhaust Radagast to put a Creature or Eagle ally from your hand into play. That ally gains: At the end of the round, shuffle this card back into your deck.\n\n \n\nThis is a powerful effect, no doubt. But I don’t think it’s too powerful. The Eagles (where he can facilitate effects from Eagles of the Misty Mountain, Support of the Eagles, To the Eyrie and The Eagles are Coming) are his obvious wheelhouse but the Mount synergy could help give him some legs elsewhere. And it would open up some cool design space for us to see some more Creature cards beyond the Eagles (wolves, maybe, as a counter-point to wargs?).\n\n \n\nAnd thematically I think it just makes a lot of sense. Radagast doesn’t command the awesome powers of Gandalf or Saruman. But while they were shaping nations and ages he was learning about the creatures and beasts of Middle-Earth and he is shown to have great influence with them.  \n\n \n\nNeutral hero could become a resource problem but you could always fix it with something like: Radagast’s Staff. Action: Exhaust Radagast’s Staff to give Radagast a printed resource icon matching the sphere of all creatures in play until the end of the phase. Or something like that. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1927247","commentId":1927247,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1449721084,"content":"I want hero versions of every wizard.

But I can see your argument as well. \n\nEdited December 12, 2015 by zeromage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1931582","commentId":1931582,"userName":"zeromage","timestamp":1449927110,"content":"> I want hero versions of every wizard.

I thought of this:\n\n\"Play with the top card of the encounter deck face-up. While the top card of the encounter deck has 'doomed x' keyword, Saruman is considered to have leadership, lore, spirit, and tactics resource icon. At the end of the round, the players, as a group, must raise their threat by X where X is the threat of the top card of the encounter deck.\"\n\nThis works well with palantir because you get the top card for free. It's also a form of scrying, but dangerous to play in single player since you have to take the threat hit yourself. While there are others playing with you, you get the benefit of being able to spread out the threat, but only a portion of the flipped cards. I also must point out that as shadow cards are dealt out, there is no player action window, so you avoid the game breaking possibility of all shadows being dealt *essentially* faced up (flipped before they are passed out).\n\nThis version kind of whiffs on the wizard pipe, unless you can get some mining involved or you are trading junk for the top of your deck. But I was curious to see what you guys think, if this is too powerful or what stats go well with this version. The doomed x keyword makes him appealing only in specific scenarios."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3496396","commentId":3496396,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1539046391,"content":"Gandalf's, and therefore Saruman's, ability is a passive effect; not an action.

Sure, there are fair cards like Deep Knowledge or Legacy of Numenor, they affect all players and it's only right their threat also affects all players. But then, there is \"local\" stuff like Herald of Anorien, Mirkwood Pioneer, and most importantly - Grima. It is unfair to punish the entire party for the advantage only one player is getting, in case of Grima - 1 resource, which makes him virtually unplayable in multiplayer. That's the flaw of the Doomed mechanic, it cannot target just the right player. So what I did with Saruman's ability is just try to make Grima and non-global Doomed stuff playable in multiplayer.\n\nI even tried to patch this issue up in my \"fix the game\" pet project long ago:\n\nCuJiFGG.png [https://i.imgur.com/CuJiFGG.png]\n\nBDkOnXe.png [https://i.imgur.com/BDkOnXe.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3749976","commentId":3749976,"userName":"breedlove2","timestamp":1564439666,"content":"Yeah, the idea is genius, it's so good I'm not sure fantasy flight can think of a better one to be honest. \n\nIf they make a crap Saruman, I might just go with this fan one anyway.  I also agree with the other guy (a while back) who said that only gandalf should see the top card of the deck.  So either Saruman belongs to a sphere, or he has mechanics to play with other spheres. Since his threat is so high, and if his ability works with doomed (meaning threat will get higher), i think that making him playable with all spheres is fine. Also remember, that this fanmade Saruman doesn't protect players from non-Doomed threat, so it's definitely not broken. And many of the doomed cards are greater than doomed 1, so there is in essence still a cost (just mitigated). Finally limiting it to once a phase is cool (also mirrors gandalf's once a phase ability).  This will encourage players not to play more than 1 doomed card a phase.\n\n \n\nSeriously it's a great core mechanic ability for Saruman.\n\nEdited July 29, 2019 by breedlove2"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3750130","commentId":3750130,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1564465569,"content":"Saruman of many colors don’t fit in the game’s timeline.

The themes and usage of the word \"master\" (as in The Master Ring) and the idea of power to control others is a very important one in Tolkien's writing, and is perfectly represented by Gandalf and Saruman. Gandalf is a \"good leader\", not adscribing power to himself but instead renouncing to it, and while he's powerful, he's more concerned with helping others reach their goals and achieve power themselves, while he stays as a pilgrim, a wanderer. Saruman is the complete opposite. He couldn't trust anything to anyone, and had to control everything himself, thus becoming a lord with a stronghold and army, a master with other minds and bodies to control for his own goals. He becomes a \"master\" in the sense Tolkien uses the word, more related to the theme of slavery rather than being a \"master at something\". (On this note, only Bombadil could truly call himself Master as he was the sole, and only a, master of himself.) So yeah, as soon as I saw the One Ring player card and the Master events we got in the deluxe, I knew the themes of power and corruption were lurking behind them, and so I really really hope this cycle will bring us Saruman and other cards and themes related to powerful, dangerous artifacts like the Palantiri and the art of ring-making. \n\nEdited August 3, 2019 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3755044","commentId":3755044,"userName":"breedlove2","timestamp":1564870638,"content":"\"Why would Saruman, from the thematical aspect of the card, or any of his toys, reduce the threat of other players when playing Doomed cards?\"\n\nHave you not played the Voice of Isengard expansion?

Threat represents The Enemy's awareness of you the heroes.  Saruman has the ability to obfuscate that, to buy time. Sure there are cards to reduce threat, but only a few heroes actually reduce threat, and it is either small and negligible (beregond, galadriel) or costs precious actions (merry).\n\nThis version of Saruman would have a much more significant impact (particularly in encounter decks that have doomed). But even outside those decks it allows you to utilize the dangerous knowledge Saruman has gathered, for little cost (in some cases no cost).\n\n \n\nTo me it feels like that it represents Saruman's ability to DIRECTLY counter Sauron. When Saruman first came to middle earth, he went into the east (and perhaps the South?)  to confer with the blue wizards and gain their insight on the state of the realms under Sauron's control.  He then went on to directly help Gondor in many conflicts (fun  fact: gained Orthanc that way).  And even when his mind changed towards gaining the ring, he was still using his knowledge to counter Sauron (drove him out of Dol Guldur by the \"machinations of Saruman\").\n\nWhat better ability to show he is the head of the order, perhaps the most significant challenge to Sauron during his time than by safeguarding each player's threat from doomed? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3755559","commentId":3755559,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1564949200,"content":"You can achieve essentially the same effect with less text with the following:\n\n\"Reduce the X value of the first Doomed X triggered each round by 1.\"\n\nAnd wording it this way makes it seem like Saruman is better at using Doomed effects, rather than reducing everyone's threat, which seems counter to the Isengard archetype."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195356-radagast-and-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=3755562","commentId":3755562,"userName":"Hannibal_pjv","timestamp":1564949254,"content":"Actually he should increase other players threat by corrupting them ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nOne other possibility is to make him a hero that can not have other heroes in his deck...
