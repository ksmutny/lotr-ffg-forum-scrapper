It seems that, once an attack begins and a defender is declared, the participants (enemy and ally) are \"locked in\" unless one or the other leaves play. Wandering Took will still be the defender if it changes control midway through an attack. So--and here I extrapolate a little, though hopefully within reason--removing a character or enemy from play can change the execution of an initiated attack, but simply moving them around on the table will not.\n\nSo, in the Son of Arnor example, the attack has already been initiated by the time Sneak Attack is played. Based on the Took ruling, I'm inclined to say that the attack would simply continue against the original defender. Even though the enemy is the one moving around in this instance, both participants in the attack are still on the board. I don't see any reason why engaging the enemy with SoA would break off the attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60370-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=594187","commentId":594187,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1329222247,"content":"I don't mind the Wandering Took.

Wandering Took is a different way you can help.\n\nAnd Plueschi and others are correct, his stats do make him pretty versatile. When he's not needed as a wandering sac-blocker, there's a few times where a teammate will be just 1 attack away from killing an enemy and you can send him over as well.

Just to be clear, I meant \"defender\" as \"defending character,\" though I don't think that changes your response. If a hero or ally has already been declared as a defender before SoA comes into play via Sneak Attack, but the attack then proceeds against the player with whom the enemy is newly engaged, does the attack simply go undefended?

The Nazgul is dealt a shadow card, declared as attacker, and Gandalf defends. The shadow card is revealed and has a shadow effect. After the effect resolves, Gandalf is chosen to be discarded.\n\nAt this point, player 2 attempts to save player 1 and plays Sneak Attack to get Son of Arnor into play. Son of Arnor's response triggers and player 2 engages the Nazgul before damage is dealt.\n\nIt's pretty clear that the Nazgul's attack is now undefended, but against whom? Is it player 1, who was attacked originally, or is it player 2, who is now engaged with the Nazgul? Or is it door number three, where the attack simply fizzles?\n\n \n\nA:\nThere are 4 steps to enemy attack resolution, and event cards/ actions can be played at the end of each step (p. 18 core rulebook):\n\n1. Choose an enemy.\n\n2. Declare defender.\n\n3. Resolve shadow effect.\n\n4. Determine combat damage.\n\nIn your example, Sneak Attack/ Son of Arnor would have to be played after step 3. Damage will then be determined against the new player with whom the Nazgul is engaged.\n\n(Once step 4 begins, there is no opportunity to play an action until it has resolved.)\n\n \n\nBooored, I have to say, and I'm speaking only for myself here, but your constant sharp negativity is beginning to become rather tiresome.  Is there a chance you could try to be a bit more constructive and more than a bit more polite?  Telling someone new to the forums that tournaments \"are never gonna happen\" and that the \"rules are ****\" makes this community look like every other forum community on the internet."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60370-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=601708","commentId":601708,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1330784403,"content":"radiskull said:\n\n \n\nBooored, I have to say, and I'm speaking only for myself here, but your constant sharp negativity is beginning to become rather tiresome.  Is there a chance you could try to be a bit more constructive and more than a bit more polite?  Telling someone new to the forums that tournaments \"are never gonna happen\" and that the \"rules are ****\" makes this community look like every other forum community on the internet.\n\n\n\ntruth hurts"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60370-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=601770","commentId":601770,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1330798699,"content":"radiskull said:\n\nBooored, I have to say, and I'm speaking for our everyone who reads these forums, but your constant sharp negativity is beginning to become rather tiresome.\n\n\nI fixed that post for you, radiskull.\n\nOn a more positive note, though, I have to personally thank Booored for helping me to open up a lot of extra free time in my schedule, since I no longer have any interest in regularly checking these boards."}]}
