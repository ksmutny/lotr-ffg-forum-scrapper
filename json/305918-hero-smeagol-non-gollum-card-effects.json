And treacheries that may affect enemies, such as pulling them into staging, cannot move him? Etc?\n\n \n\nEdited February 17 by JYoder"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305918-hero-smeagol-non-gollum-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=3896116","commentId":3896116,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1581976942,"content":"That is the community consensus, yes."}]}
