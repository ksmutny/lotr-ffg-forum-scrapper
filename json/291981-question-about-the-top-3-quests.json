However I would recommend to have few packs from cycle 2 and 3 to expand your card pool before facing those top 3 quests which are extremely fun but quite difficult. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291981-question-about-the-top-3-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3644424","commentId":3644424,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1552240759,"content":"Those quests are the favorites for their grandiose scale, depth of strategy, and link to the theme of the source material; not because they provide a well-rounded experience for relatively newer players. They're still amazing quests, don't get me wrong! I don't want to discourage you from tying them out, of course, but be prepared for some serious difficulty and weight.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the people that would vote on such a subject are the people that are most dedicated to the game. That would suggest veteran players who are much more familiar with deck-building, strategy, etc. I think if you polled newer players that have completed just Shadows of Mirkwood, you'd have very different results for favorite quests.\n\nAgain, don't let this discourage you from trying out those quests if you want to! This is just my view!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291981-question-about-the-top-3-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3644467","commentId":3644467,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1552244808,"content":"It should be possible to win with that card pool, but as others have mentioned here these quests fall more on the difficult side of the spectrum.
