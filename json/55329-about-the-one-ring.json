Storywise it is in Bilbo's possession during the time this game takes place, and no one knows that it is in fact The One Ring.\n\nSo how to bring The One Ring into the game?\n\n \n\nFor example, you could made an attachment card \"The One Ring\". Text would be something like:\n\nAction: When your hero activates The One Ring, no enemy is able to attack him. Besides, he transforms into a very evil person and turns against you. Place the hero in the staging area. The hero gets a threat value of 100, an attacking value of 100, a defending value of 100 and 100 LP. Paint yourself nine Nazgul cards and place them at the top of your encounter deck. Every Nazgul gets the surge attribute. Good luck!\n\n \n\nBut seriously, I could see The One Ring as an attachment, but with heavy restrictions, like encreasing your threat level by 10 to get invisible for a round/phase, but giving you the advantage of being invisible (being able to attack before your enemy does without exhausting your hero, for example)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55329-about-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=547460","commentId":547460,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1319608300,"content":"I'm kind of hoping that they leave the one ring out of the game, I don't think it is needed.

The ability of Frodo in this game closely matches what was done in the Decipher CCG with Isildurs Baine - the bearer puts the ring on and wounds become burdens (threat). From a flavour perspective they have captured the effect of Frodo having the ring without actually producing a specific card for it.
