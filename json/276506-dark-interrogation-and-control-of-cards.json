I don't think that was the original intention, but I think you're right about the rules-as-written interpretation there.

I agree you control them, but control is not enough. \n\nFrom the rules:: Card effects do not interact with cards in an out of play state unless the effect specifically refers to that state.\n\nSince Dark Interrogation doesn't specifically refer to cards out of play, it gets the default behavior of affecting only cards in play and does not the rest, regardless of control.
