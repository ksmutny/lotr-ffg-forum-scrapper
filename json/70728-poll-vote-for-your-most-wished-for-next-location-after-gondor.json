If your Hobbit heroes in AtS hypothesis is right, Rich, I'd even say that would add more support to the Shire for next cycle (although I'm unsure why, as the DD heroes are fairly unrepresentative of Gondor, with the possible exception of Lore Aragorn). With B perhaps we'd get some Barrow Downs quests (or with A, I suppose).\n\nN could get us lots of Snow, Orcs, and Black Numenoreans (if we go back in time). In fact we could have an Angmar/Forochel cycle that was in the Second Age (but we'd need a new Witch-King card right?).\n\nF would be cool, we could have some Ents, Huorns (at least they made it into the extended cut), Saruman, hopefully a Theoden, probably a Grima, ERKENBRAND!!!, Eomer, maybe even going back Helm Hammerhand, Eorl, Thengel (so many options!). Maybe FFG will hold on a lot of the later characters for the Saga (if there is one), certainly we'll get a new Eowyn with the saga (maybe just an ally?). A cool quest (granted for a Saga Exp.) would be the \"exorcism\" of Theoden, much more drawn out in the book than in the movie, where one would have to find the different events/objects (hearken, rise up, gaze over the lands, grasp a sword hilt, etc.) in the encounter deck, although this might prove difficult as there were no enemies (ok maybe you could have guards and wormtongue, or a treachery \"reach of saruman\" or something like that). just an idea.\n\nAt any rate, for the purposes of this poll though I'm going to say that I'd really like to see B (Bree), although A is a close second (and darn I want some more horse-lords too!!!)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70728-poll-vote-for-your-most-wished-for-next-location-after-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=690835","commentId":690835,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1347267949,"content":"so many good options isnt there? thanks for voting\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70728-poll-vote-for-your-most-wished-for-next-location-after-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=690837","commentId":690837,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1347268155,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nso many good options isnt there? thanks for voting\n\nrich\n\n\n\nYep, many, many, and we should be happy b/c then there is no excuse to end the game (unless people tire of it and sales fall off)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70728-poll-vote-for-your-most-wished-for-next-location-after-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=690838","commentId":690838,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1347268427,"content":"John85 said:\n\nrichsabre said:\n\n \n\nso many good options isnt there? thanks for voting\n\nrich\n\n \n\n \n\nYep, many, many, and we should be happy b/c then there is no excuse to end the game (unless people tire of it and sales fall off)\n\n\n\ni can say with certainty ill buy this game until it dies…..which i hope is many years away, and i shall keep playing it long after"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70728-poll-vote-for-your-most-wished-for-next-location-after-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=690849","commentId":690849,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1347269358,"content":"richsabre said:\n\n \n\ni can say with certainty ill buy this game until it dies…..which i hope is many years away, and i shall keep playing it long after\n\n\n\nAnd that's why I'm sleeving now, so the cards will stay in good condition for a long time (esp. with small children running around).

About my vote, although I would love ALL middle earth covered by this wonderful game, I think that a great place to visit after Gondor could be the lost realm of Cardolan (your B option).\n\nAnd I say so thinking in the multiple options we can get  in these lands. For example, I would think something as the following:\n\n1- Bandits arount the Gwathló.\n\nOur fellowship could get to Minhiriath (the southern part of Cardolan) by sea with a message to Bree, and on arriving there, they are warned about lots of dunlendings bandits from Dunland and Enedwaith, plaguing the remnants of Cardolani people that live around the mouths of the Gwathló. Here we can get some new foes as the Dunlendings.\n\n2- Ruins of Tharbad\n\nGoing up the river in a boat, they finally reach the ruins of Tharbad, and in this journey they can get some nasty river treacheries and locations in tharbad.\n\n3- Spies within Bree\n\nFinally reaching Bree, we can have here some hobbit interaction, and some quest of helping the Rangers uncovering dark spies within the city (maybe Saruman's agents that can lead lately to Isengard).\n\n4- The Barrow Downs\n\nThe pursuit of Saruman's agents lead our heros to the Old Forest, and lately to the Barrow Downs, where we have the undead as new foes.\n\n5- Retreat to Amon Sûl\n\nHaving to fight their way out of the Barrow Downs, our heros retreat to Weathertop, having to fight back the hordes of undead.\n\n6- The Gap of Rohan\n\nFree of the undead, our heros address south following the lead of the agents found in Bree. Here they could meet the Half-orcs of the White Hand along with the Dunlendings again due to travel across their lands.\n\nAnd this could lead to a new cycle in Rohan.\n\nWhat do you think?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70728-poll-vote-for-your-most-wished-for-next-location-after-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=690940","commentId":690940,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1347279195,"content":" I would also really like to see Harad explored a bit more.
