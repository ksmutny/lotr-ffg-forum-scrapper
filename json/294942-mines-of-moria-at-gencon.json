On the other hand I would like to see some new scenarios like The Scouring of the Shire."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294942-mines-of-moria-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=3696450","commentId":3696450,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1557114135,"content":"Agree with you. Would be nice to see scouring but I feel like that would be the final pack after the Mordor cycle maybe?"}]}
