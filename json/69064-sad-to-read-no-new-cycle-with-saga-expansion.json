The major seller of any game line is always the Core Set. Right now, someone wanting to buy the Core set and an AP is limited to the first 6 from the first cycle. Any Dwarrodelf AP requires not only that AP, but the Kazad Deluxe expansion as well.\n\nThey need to find a way to make the Core set matter to people buying AP later on.\n\nAlso, although most Shadows of Mirkwood AP are still widerly available, there may come a time when they won't be. Rather than just counting on reprints, they should put other products out there that compliment the Core Set.\n\nThey could even come up with \"optional\" type of quests where you get to play it using only encounters from Core + AP or Core + Deluxe + AP, based on what you own.\n\nI do believe this game requires a regular influx of quest cards to keep fresh.

We've had two cycles that are somewhat (if not outright) tangential to the principal source material, so now we get something from the source material. And which item do we start with? The first - ergo we have The Hobbit coming out.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the new movie coming out, and even if it's before the movie release, its release is early enough for us, and current enough for fans of the movie to lay hands on one if they're interested. So perhaps the release is timed to around the time of the movie, but as others have pointed out these \"saga expansions\" will all be released this year while the second (and now third movies) won't come out for another year or two.\n\nRegardless of FFG's motives for releasing The Hobbit, I'm excited that it will be out soon.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69064-sad-to-read-no-new-cycle-with-saga-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=673646","commentId":673646,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1344944850,"content":"SiCK_Boy said:\n\nWhy is everyone dismissing the possibility that a new cycle will being in the fall, maybe even between the release of the 2 saga expansions, using cards from the Core Set only (plus each AP), in the same way that Shadows of Mirkwood cycle did?\n\nBecause, in the past, new cycles for every LCG have been announced about five or six months prior to their release."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69064-sad-to-read-no-new-cycle-with-saga-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=673665","commentId":673665,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1344946637,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\n \n\n \n\nBecause, in the past, new cycles for every LCG have been announced about five or six months prior to their release.\n\n \n\n \n\nthat's simply not the case (at least not always).

Simple. I believe we only get this break, not change, because of the movies coming out. Also, you don't really get 12 AP's a year, more around 6-8. (this goes for CoC and W:I too, aGoT might be slightly more polupair due to the new book and the tv series) So, well, getting one pack almost every month for the beginning of the year, to me, Makes it a matter of cause that we won't be getting any more the rest of this year. Instead of beginning a new cycle this year, getting 2 AP's before Christmas, we get the 2 hobbit expansions. If we won't be getting a new AP for January THEN I'll humbly redraw my statement and bang my head against FFG's logo on my monitor :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Until then, \"Do not despair\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69064-sad-to-read-no-new-cycle-with-saga-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=674503","commentId":674503,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1345077835,"content":" Also, in addition to my post above ^.
