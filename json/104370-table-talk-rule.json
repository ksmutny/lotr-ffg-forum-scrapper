They don't share the animosity that Elves and Dwarves have for each other so I'm sure would work together properly and let the other \"team\" know exactly what they have up their sleeves and in their scabbards.\n\nb) Is not very thematic to begin with, when are dwarves and elves going to team up for a quest? Unless it is some huge necessity or they have no choice (eg: fellowship, battle of five armies)\n\nAlso \"killed this part of the game and taken any guess work out of knowing what your partner might have or need\". Theres no guess work in Solo so its just like Solo but some people don't want to play Solo with only one deck and only one encounter card revealed per turn. In my opinion I think solo takes away from the game and its mechanics and is a lesser way of playing considering things like surge, doomed etc lose alot of their bite (then again you have less actions and characters so not saying its easier, I just personally don't like this variant). I'm not going to rant on about it though, call it easier, illegal or cheating or offend all Solo Players on here and act like a complete jerk in general.\n\n\"This game was never deigned to be played two handed solo - it's something that was made up by people who don't like playing solo and don't have friends to play with.\" Yeah I don't like playing solo and don't have friends who are interested in this sort of game, this does not mean im cheating or playing illegally, im just playing two player on my own because I dont like to play solo/with one deck. If it is really cheating, illegal and as easy as you seem to think then probably more than half of the people on here aren't playing the same game as you apparently.\n\n \n\nBottom line I think you should either not bother participating in these forums and just go away or show alot more respect for the other people who post on here.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1056200","commentId":1056200,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1398059367,"content":"Why this \"illegality\" of playing two-handed alone bothers you so much?

If we take another example; \"I cheated at my computer game to get more money, the money let me see the end of the game.\" Now if you do that in isolation or acknowledge the cheating when you talk to others about the game it probably won't matter. If however your friends haven't beaten the game and you brag about beating it first your friends will probably get annoyed when they discover you cheated.\n\n \n\nIn the case of this card game if many people play two handed - and then playing two handed is functionally different (as 7theye is of the opinion it is) then those people being heavily involved in say, strategy and play discussions without acknowledging the variant they play will interfere with and upset the discussions.\n\n \n\nPersonally I think that playing two handed is not that different from playing two player. You do lack information about the other players hand; but I really don't think this is going to have that much impact. It's pretty rare that the other player will have a card which significantly changes your play.\n\nSome corner cases may exist if you knew they had shadow card cancellation in hand you might spend Balin's resource when you would otherwise keep it. On the other hand if I was in that game I would certainly ask; \"Do I need to keep Balin's resource?\" And then without revealing what they have in hand the other player would probably say yes or no.\n\nIf people play in silence and don't communicate at at all I guess that could be a different play experience, but I don't think that's what most people have in mind when they want to play co-op. Because I don't think two-handed is much different from two player I don't think I would care if people discussed strategies and then I found out they played two-handed later; even though I never would. \n\n(I never would because of the hassle, not a moral objection)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1056473","commentId":1056473,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1398089566,"content":"When I play 2 or more player games we don't show each other our hands, and try to limit the amount of direct card referencing as much possible, but we have no problem asking another player if they have a card that will help in a certain situation, but ultimately it will be up to the player with the card to use it or not. On very tough situations we may strategize a bit more, and each player will say I can do this with these cards and such. The most strategizing generally takes place during the encounter and combat phase there is actually very little during the planning phase and players generally never suggest to a player which ally to play etc.\n\nTwo handed solo play, which i don't play any more, is really different then playing with another player. I stopped playing it because it seemed to alter the balance of the game and made it easier then playing with another player. Because I had control of both decks, i could plan a strategy that would not likely occur with a second player, unless we were playing completely open hands or the other player played the game exactly like I did.\n\nFor example, In 2 handed solo i could build decks and have a hero continually give his resource Bifur in the other deck, and then I could also have Theodred from the other deck always give his resource from questing to Bifur too. Further more, I could have the other deck play SoG on Bifur. Most likely this would not happen in a real 2 player game, unless players sat down and said this is exactly how we are going to play these decks, which is a valid way to play, but there would probably still be some minor differences in player choices, unless every card played was okayed by both players, which would then completely break the table talk rule, but at that point even with a second player, they are pretty much playing a solo 2 handed game. Most players I have played with would not want to loose 2 resources per round and give up SoG, and they also want to have freedom in the chocies they make to enjoy the game. Even if i disagree with a choice, i still need to respect how they are playing the game, or else it's not going to be very much fun.\n\nSo, generally I think 2 handed play allows for deck building and game play strategies that are usually not likely to occur in regular 2 player games. I will not say it is cheating since it's a non competitive game and we can play how we like, but I can see why it would be considered illegal and not supported as an official play style by FFG."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1056517","commentId":1056517,"userName":"entMoot","timestamp":1398092936,"content":"In addition to the fact that we are playing a cooperative game, even in competitive CCGs like Magic there are casual variant formats that get played though there are no official rules for them.

Each and every one of these formats feels different than the others, which is why I don't like restricting myself to any given one, because they all open up different experiences. That being said, I think good strategy and good deck building translates across all of them, and doesn't change substantially. Think about the common practice of one player building decks for everyone else in a 2-4 player game. Is this cheating? It does allow for more coordination and knowledge than would be possible otherwise, but is not cheating, and is common because it is difficult to plan out decks to work together well unless you're blessed with an abundance of free time. On the other hand, everyone showing up with a random deck is its own fun and its own challenge, but not superior in some moral sense.\n\n \n\nPersonally, I've always maintained that the table talk rule is itself silly and should not have been included in the rulebook. It could've simply been included in a \"suggestions\" section for players to use if they are worried about one player dominating all the decisions. One reason why is because, according to the letter of the rules, you can say \"ambush Istari\", or I have \"shadow cancellation in hand\", or \"I have a Spirit ally that can boost defense\" and it's perfectly valid. Why go through these contortions? People can argue about the spirit of the rule, but according to the rules themselves, the only thing that is strictly forbidden is reading actual text off a card or naming it. \n\n \n\nWith that in mind, I follow every rule in the rules to the letter, except the table talk one. As I said, I don't think it should have been included as a rule, as unlike every other rule, it doesn't govern mechanics of the game, but what players can say to each other, which is an extremely odd fit in a cooperative card game. Another cooperative card game, Pathfinder ACG, provides no similar rule, for example. As we all know, the designers made a few odd decisions in the Core Set, simply because this model was so new.  \n\nEdited April 21, 2014 by Raven1015"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1056785","commentId":1056785,"userName":"7theye","timestamp":1398107493,"content":"> When I play 2 or more player games we don't show each other our hands, and try to limit the amount of direct card referencing as much possible, but we have no problem asking another player if they have a card that will help in a certain situation, but ultimately it will be up to the player with the card to use it or not.

That's why it's technically cheating.\n\nYou can play chess where a rook can move diagnoally if you want. It's your game just like this is.

(In the same vein I may discuss a house rule to my role-playing game).\n\nYou playing a game with the wrong number of players in the star wars example does not invalidate your experiences. However I believe that if you were to take that play experience and then try to suggest, for instance, balance changes where some cards turned out to be rubbish or too good - that other players could legitimately call you out on trying to say your play experience should impact theirs when you're intentionally house ruling.  -\n\nUltimiately I feel the problem that 7theye and now Tracker1 are highlighting is that fundamentally playing two handed is not the same as the experience that's supported by the game designers and therefore it would be akin to you saying that your solo experience should lead to other players experince being changed (if you asked for errata say). I don't think anyone is claiming that playing a variant is itself a problem, rather playing it and then trying to change the game through discussion and not acknowledging the variant is wrong.\n\nYour Arkham Horror example is completely off topic because the rules specifically allow exactly what you're saying. Arkham Horror also contains no hidden information at all. Therefore a group of players playing it together could discuss everything just like an individual playing 8 (and you must be mad if you do) investigators them-self.\n\nThe meta-game element that brings so much scrutiny is that we're on a forum for this game - and so everyone here likes to discuss the game extensively. This leads to people who play variants that are commonly accepted but unsupported potentially asking for strategies or plans which other players think should never be allowed.\n\nIn a pick-up game I would not play with someone that had the same hero as me, I would rather play with someone else or play a different deck. Two spirit glorfindels or two Eowyns (or imagine two lore pippins with +6 or 7 to every enemies engagement threat) is just too imbalanced to make the game fun for me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057097","commentId":1057097,"userName":"iznax","timestamp":1398122402,"content":"7theye [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/user/225120-7theye/]: You can play chess where a rook can move diagnoally if you want.

I'm merely going on what others have said. (Notably so far, only Tracker1,7theye and yourself have actually expressed an opinion on whether two handed is fundermentally different or only a bit different). \n\nMy theoretical position is that I agree with you, that playing two handed and playing co-op with another is basically the same. Although I think your reprinting of the table talk rule has made me feel that I'm actually wrong.\n\nFor example - in two player, I may go first and use Denethor (hero) to look at the top card of the deck, decide I can't deal with it and move it to the bottom (the rules disallow me from discussing it with the table). \n\nIn two handed, I may know that player 2 can deal with that card and keep it on top of the deck.\n\nThis element of the hidden knowledge is the part that is changed the most in my mind (not what players have in hand - but what players may have revealed to themselves about the encounter deck). \n\nAs for your ridiculous assertion about being able to show the cards to other players, it may not actually state this in the rules but I think it clearly is the case that the whole point of hidden knowledge is that it's hidden - some of the basic assumptions about card games (your hand is secret information) must surely come into play here - I don't think you can expect every game to reprint such absolute basics. - Since you yourself claim this is ridiculous I'm sure that you understand where I'm coming from :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nThat said I also feel that your statement about \"two handed being seen as easier\" is probably the fundamental issue here. I suspect if 7theye thought it wasn't \"cheating\" (easier) this thread\n\nwouldn't have been made. Tracker1 also wouldn't have stopped playing two handed.\n\nYou yourself adopted the variant to look for more difficulty (Which seems perfectly legitimate as well providing that it's acknowledged as a variant). I think the accusations of cheating are far too serious for what we're actually talking about - the word is too highly emotive to actually fit the topic, at least for me. Others in this thread may feel differently.\n\n \n\nI think the goal of the table-talk rule, was to allow players to not be played by each other - it's an attempt to preserve the hidden information aspects of the game even from your own team. I play a lot of co-op games and it's really difficult to balance the hidden information aspects when everyone is on the same side - you need to allow communication or you can't win (or people aren't really working together so its not co-op) but if you have too much then games can be \"solved\" by the best player.\n\nEdit: To clarify that I know Raven1015 know's his ridiculous argument is absurd and not to make it seem like I took him seriously when he seemed not to be serious :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nEdited April 22, 2014 by Rapier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057167","commentId":1057167,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1398126231,"content":"> > 7theye [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/user/225120-7theye/]: You can play chess where a rook can move diagnoally if you want.

Maybe if two players play together for a long time they will get to know each others tendencies and play styles, so that they build really tight decks together and will make many of the same choices in game play, but even then I cannot picture that another player will make the same exact choices as another.\n\nUntil recently I actually used to think that many players would make the same choices, but after seeing the results of 2 Duplicate Tournaments where players are given the same encounter deck and player deck arranged in the same order, i have yet to see a game that is 100% the same as another player. There has been about 20 players in each tournament, and each game was different.\n\nLooking at a 2 player game with this lens, there are many choices that each player will make that might slightly vary from another player, and it could, for better or worse, have a big impact on the game. So, when I think about 2 handed solo, A player has complete control over all of those choices and even the structure of both of the decks and knows intimately how the decks can work together. In my opinion the 2 handed solo player has a greater advantage when compared 2 real players.\n\nI absolutely don't think there is anything wrong with playing 2 handed solo, and do not look down upon it at all. I just think it is important to recognize that playing this way allows a player to create a more optimum strategy for winning that is not easy to replicate in a real 2 player game, unless one player is calling all the shots for the another player. Even if they come to what seems to be a mutually agreed upon strategy by working together it might not be what either of them would have figured out if playing alone\n\nOf course the skill of the 2 players can be factored in, but that's a bit more difficult to asses how that will impact game results. For instance, if you had a very good player with an inexperienced player, and there was some table talk and strategizing, but the experienced player did not dominate the game. They might win, but if each player played the same game 2 handed solo, I'd bet that the more experienced player would have the best results out of all 3 games, with the inexperience player having the worst score and the match they played together being right in the middle. Of course that's all just speculation."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057172","commentId":1057172,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1398126540,"content":"> Of course that's all just speculation.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nSounds like you should run a two-player duplicate tournament sometime to me :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] \n\nMaybe even a two player tournament with two players playing together then apart - if enough interest could be found."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057186","commentId":1057186,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1398127597,"content":"> That said I also feel that your statement about \"two handed being seen as easier\" is probably the fundamental issue here.

Others in this thread may feel differently.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nAgreed. The whole framing as \"cheating\" is why the debate is so impassioned, I imagine. If it was framed as, \"Is two-handed a variant?\", then I doubt there'd be much disagreement. The fundamental assertion that two-handed play is easier has to be broken down into parts:\n\n \n\n- Two-handed play is easier than solo play with one deck: This depends on the quest. However, the claim that two-handed play is always easier than solo is just false. Again, depends on the quest. The Druadan Forest is a good example of a scenario that I've just absolutely dominated with one deck, but is much more challenging two-handed. Into Ithilien is another example, where I wouldn't say I beat it easily with one deck, but two decks was more challenging personally.\n\n- Two-handed play is easier than an actual 2-player game: This is pretty much what Tracker is saying (not to put words in your mouth, Tracker), and I agree. Having played plenty of both, the level of coordination you get playing two-handed solo can't be matched by even 2 players who work really well together. However, there is extreme variance among 2 player games. When playing with an inexperienced player, I follow table talk pretty much to the letter, because it's too tempting to dominate. When playing with people I play with often, the cooperation is high, and we usually give resources to each other more often than ourselves, as an example.\n\n \n\nI think the underlying tension was that to call it cheating means that two-handed makes it easier in both cases. In the first case, this is not true, and in the second case, it is. Is it a variant? Sure. Is it cheating? No. There are a variety of reasons why people play two-handed: wanting to see more of the encounter deck and its synergy, wanting to take advantage of ranged/sentinel, wanting to build more specialized decks than are possible in pure solo, etc. My point is not to say that two-handed solo doesn't make the game different, my point is that it doesn't make it different enough that we can invalidate people from participating in discussions because they play two-handed. It's not equivalent to someone playing both sides in Star Wars and giving strategy input. \n\n \n\nAnyway, thanks Rapier for engaging in constructive internet discussion. It shouldn't have to be called out specifically, but with so many bad examples out there, thanks for debating in a productive and non-trollish spirit!\n\nEdited April 22, 2014 by Raven1015"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057189","commentId":1057189,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1398127701,"content":"Just for the record, some matches I played 2 handed seemed easier for reasons I mentioned in terms of control I had over both decks. A scenarios difficulty certainly varies depending the number of players. Generally, When I was playing 2 handed I had easier victories when playing by myself then I did when playing the same scenario with another player even if they were using a deck I created. of course, we might have had a tougher encounter draw, but my suspicion was the the difficult increase was due to some of the choices that the other player made or how our collective choices differed. Basically it seemed easier when I could see both hands and make all the choices.\n\nOne of my main reason for not playing 2 handed has to do with the extra bookkeeping, i can certainly see how it allows a solo player to come up with great synergy between the decks and use cards and keywords not really suitable to solo play. It's just too finicky for me. Another reason, is I don enjoy building 2 decks that work together, unless it is with another player. I can see myself trying to set up more broken card interactions, or setting up the decks that allow one deck to excel and carry the wait of the game while the other just provides card draw or resources for the other deck. Basically, when I was building some of these decks i was creating a partner deck that would be the suckiest deck for another player to play, because all that deck would do was support my deck which was doing most of the cool stuff. In 2 handed solo play that is no big deal, with another player that's pretty lame, unless they enjoy that role. That sort of became my approach, and of course each player can set there own limits for how they deal with this, but for me it became a boring exercise, because both decks sucked on their own, and were worthless for solo play which I enjoyed more anyway."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057190","commentId":1057190,"userName":"Sinamil2","timestamp":1398127775,"content":"I have no problem with playing it either way and love playing 2 handed and with others.  I agree completely that this is a rule to stop one player from running things in general play, but should be implemented according to your group of players.  Tracker is dead on about the appeal of 2 handed as well, it opens strategies up that might not work with friends/pick up players."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057328","commentId":1057328,"userName":"DC06675","timestamp":1398135368,"content":"I would agree with Raven1015 in that it depends on the quests as to whether 2 handed solo is actually easier or harder than pure solo. A good example is the Fords of Isen and To Catch an Orc quests from the new VoI expansion.  These two quests are significantly easier solo than two-handed solo (in my opinion) because drawing multiple encounter cards per round really allows those encounter cards to synergize with one another.  I feel that the argument that pure solo is harder really only counts for a few of the newer quests and was truly more of a problem in the beginning when the quests didn't compensate well for having extra players. Now, most quests include on the quest cards (reveal or add 1 card per player), which has helped make the scenarios more balanced no matter how many players are playing.\n\n \n\nAs for table talk, I don't really abide by the rule because I too think it is a little pointless and not very thematic in my mind (i.e. if you are on a quest or in a battle, you would more likely yell to someone \"hey, put on your citadel plate so that troll doesn't kill you the first time he swings at you\" than you would say \"hey, take one of my three Gondorian shields I happen to be carrying with me).  That is just me though, I have never understood the point of the rule (even the idea that one shouldn't dominate the game is really something that should be policed by the group). A lot about this game has grown and developed over the past three years and the table talk rule is one that really only stands to frustrate the true co-op aspects of this game imo.  Some people may like it and that is cool, but for me I find the game far more enjoyable when I can strategize with my 'team' rather than strategize to myself and hope we are on the same page. \n\n \n\nEither way the 'spirit of the game' is to have fun, so whatever floats your boat."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057488","commentId":1057488,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1398148637,"content":"Just talk.  The point of the game is to have fun and what's the use of inviting your friends over to sit silently and read to yourselves.  The best social games (particularly co-op ones) are actually built around encouraging communication.  Mechanically, many of them don't even require multiple players.  The options are all face-up and on the table for everyone to see.  The fun comes through the communication between players as they argue, debate and contribute to the decisions that must be made every turn.  They are as much a social exercise as they are a game.  This is the same reason I don't play 2 handed solo.  While it may mechanically smooth out the game, the social aspect is lost and I think that's too integral a part of the game to go without.  I'll play normal solo, but it's not the same as sitting across from someone and trying to work together to win.\n\n \n\nPreserving a little of each player's privacy in LotRtCG is both thematic and helpful for developing features which encourage communication.  Player A can't tell Player B what Denethor sees coming in the quest phase, but I think it's obvious that such knowledge was meant to be communicated.  Wide eyes and a cold sweat when you scry that card are just as engaging as jumping up and yelling \"Oh crap!  ANOTHER Master's Malice!\"  Do what feels natural without ruining the game for you.\n\n \n\nI don't think it's necessary to include the table talk rule as it's written, but it's an excellent guideline.  Encourage open strategizing and also tactful insinuations.  The funny thing is, I never had to worry about this rule anyway.  When I play, their recommended communication level is just what feels natural to me.\n\n \n\nNow that that's settled we can get back to gaming!  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] jk"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057554","commentId":1057554,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1398160798,"content":"All players always see the card watched by Denethor, and all speak about keep or send to bottom.

But normally, in normal and oficial games, usually do it.\n\n \n\nPer the rules - the card that Denethor reveals is only available to that player. The other players shouldn't get to see it, and the Denethor player isn't meant to communicate what the card is.\n\nNow it's all a bit fluffy really as most social interaction rules are. I'd like to use a clearer example from another FFG game to illustrate how I think it should be played - although the rules are fluffy and technically Denethor could say \"hey guys, I feel we're going to need 4 more willpower than we thought \" which doesn't read the name or text on the card - you could say \"a lot\" instead if you didn't want to read the 4 out at all.\n\n \n\n \n\nIn the Death Angel Card game every turn one player needs to reveal a new encounter card. Some of those cards have the rule Instinct. If that rule is on the card then the player has to make all decisions about the card (targeting choices and things) without consulting the other players. If it isn't they can discuss with other players before resolving the card.\n\nNow I like this as a rule, because it preserves hidden information and means that individuals have to make choices by themselves - but which may influence the entire game. However not all decisions are like this. The preservation of hidden information in a co-op game is appealing because it lets people feel they personally have an impact on the game.\n\nIn the lord of the rings card game I've always personally liked to play with the encounter deck knowledge being like instinct - you have to decide without consulting.  The reason for this is because it's possible to play without the encounter deck knowledge at all - and therefore if not all players know it then the game can still function.\n\nOn the other hand if you tried to apply a strict similar interpretation to the player's hands you would lead to awkward situations - like I have a gandalf in hand, if I play it I can kill the enemy that means you can't quest with Eowyn - if you quest with Eowyn then I won't threat out and lose this round, but I'm not meant to tell you that I can play gandalf. However if I tell you to quest with Eowyn you must know I have a solution to the problem in hand anyway.\n\nIt's easier just to let people reveal relevant information from their hand. I mean playing with the whole hand revealed is less good (I know this because sometimes my wife and I have to do that because of our child), the game is better with hidden information. However trying to keep the whole hand hidden all the time leads to well, intentionally trying to make the game harder?\n\nI'd like to play the game with no table talk (poker style) where you aren't allowed to ever discuss the actual cards sometime and see how it goes but more as an experiment than from the belief that it would be more fun playing that way.\n\nAs to the main topic -  I think I've come round to thinking that playing two handed is different enough that it can effect strategy and deck building; so I would not want the designers to start making cards that worked for it (mainly because I think cards for it would be a bit weak in a standard two player game). Although I doubt that it's different enough to negate the value of people engaging in debate even if that's exclusively what they play.\n\nBesides our community is too small to start cutting people out :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104370-table-talk-rule/?do=findComment&comment=1057581","commentId":1057581,"userName":"iznax","timestamp":1398165258,"content":"The bottom line of the table talk rule is that they try to eliminate the alfa \"A\" gamer.

Sure I have ahd games where 2 players had SoG in the deck, but that was because the deck they were playing was built around a strategy that needed it, so they had every intention to play it on one of their heroes.\n\nA solo player that has 3 cores sets could put 3 copies of SoG in each deck with the hope that it will show up earlier, and then play it on the hero of the deck that needs it.\n\nThese are some of the subtle differences that a player can make when he is building 2 decks and playing them as one. Resources and cards will be able to move freely between the 2 decks and strategies within the deck can be developed to take advantage of a player having control over both decks.\n\nOf course, I don't see anything wrong with a player playing 2 handed solo, it's another way to enjoy the game and it can be still very challenging. Personally, i don't think designers should develop cards to support it, but honestly I do not know what a card like that would look like.\n\nComparing the difficulty of games when playing 1 hand solo play to 2 hand solo play really does not have anything to so with conversation. Since much of that has to do with how a scenario scales with the number of players. The major comparison has to do with 2 hand solo to 2 player game. This is where the table talk discussion is really important. Even players who completly ignore the table talk rule, probably allow some freedom in another player to make a choice, rather then telling them exactly what to do. If you are playing 2 handed solo you are telling both decks exactly what you what them to do. That's the major difference I see between the 2 types of playing, i am pretty sure this makes an impact on the game, does it make it easier?
