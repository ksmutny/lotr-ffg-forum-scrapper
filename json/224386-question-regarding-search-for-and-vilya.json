Shuffle your deck.\"\n\nDoes this mean that I can choose ANY card that has this trait (Pipe), e.g. Wizard Pipe, or must I pick the first one that shows up during the search?\n\n142006.png [http://ringsdb.com/bundles/cards/142006.png]\n\nAlso, not related to this first question, another doubt emerged. Regarding Vilya, what is the difference between \"Play\" and \"Put into play\"? It seems to me that the card gives the player an option to CHOOSE between these two ways of playing a card, it is not worded so to differentiate between allies/attachment, which can be both played and put into play, and events, which cannot be put into play, only played (so, it is, from my perspective, related to HOW you play the top card of your deck and NOT WHAT you play). Am I correct?\n\n04137.png [http://ringsdb.com/bundles/cards/04137.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224386-question-regarding-search-for-and-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=2298459","commentId":2298459,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1467839450,"content":"1) You may choose any qualifying card that you find in your search for Pipes.\n\n2) The distinction on Vilya exists because you don't put Events into play, you play them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224386-question-regarding-search-for-and-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=2299633","commentId":2299633,"userName":"Gandalf196","timestamp":1467910439,"content":"> 1) You may choose any qualifying card that you find in your search for Pipes.\n> \n> 2) The distinction on Vilya exists because you don't put Events into play, you play them.\n\n \n\n2) So, you mean that I cannot play allies/attachments through Vilya, but only put them into play?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224386-question-regarding-search-for-and-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=2299740","commentId":2299740,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1467915426,"content":"> > 1) You may choose any qualifying card that you find in your search for Pipes.\n> > \n> > 2) The distinction on Vilya exists because you don't put Events into play, you play them.\n> \n>  \n> \n> 2) So, you mean that I cannot play allies/attachments through Vilya, but only put them into play?[/size]\n\nThat, I am sad to say, is correct.

There is no choice in the matter. So Erebor Hammersmith, whose text does not mention \"from your hand\", still cannot be triggered when Vilya'ed in.

(I think things like Skyward Volley were being questioned...?) Would be great if someone could confirm that, though.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nThe ruling was that Vilya also allows you to play Skyward Volley without having to have a ranged character.  I also believe he mentioned a distinction between costs like Skyward Volley's and costs like \"Do X to Y\".\n\n \n\n \n\nSeastan posed the following questions:\n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> 1. Can Vilya be used to play an event, like Galadhrim's Greeting, if you do not have access to the spirit sphere (I know a match is required for 0 cost cards, but Vilya says \"no cost\" so I'm wondering if that is a key difference)?\n>  \n> 2. Does Vilya ignore the \"additional costs\" of cards like Skyward Volley?\n>  \n> 3. Does Vilya ignore payment restrictions of cards like Thicket of Spears?\n>  \n> 4. Does Vilya ignore requirements to be able to play a card like Ent Draught (since you can \"put into play\" the card instead of \"playing\" it)?\n>  \n> 5. Does Vilya ignore costs on cards that have a built-in cost in the form \"cost to effect\" phrase like Quick Strike? If so, how does Quick Strike work if you have not exhausted a character?\n\n \n \n \n \n\n> > 1. Yes. There is actually an FAQ enter for Vilya in the Q&A section that basically says playing a card at “no cost” does not require a resource match.\n> > \n> > 2. Yes. “At no cost” encompasses the additional cost because it is described as a “cost.\"\n> > 3. Yes. Since you are playing Thicket of Spears at no cost, there is no need to pay for it, and therefore no need to spend resources from 3 different heroes’ pools.\n> > 4. Yes. The play restriction on Ent Draught is irrelevant because you are putting it into play, not playing it.\n> > 5. No. Vilya allows you to ignore resource match and printed cost with its ability (and anything that is described as “an additional cost”), but it does not allow you to trigger effects without paying their ‘cost’ because these ‘costs’ are not what Vilya refers to. The term ‘cost’ as used in the expression “cost to effect” is not a formal cost, like the kind that Vilya can ignore; they are an informal ‘cost.’ We only call them costs to help players understand that you must do whatever that thing is in order to receive the benefit of the effect. You can think of the difference between ‘costs’ here like big “C” costs and little ‘c’ costs, similar to big ‘A’ Actions and little ‘a’ actions in the game. \n> > I hope that helps.\n> > Cheers,\n> > Caleb\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n\nEdited August 1, 2016 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224386-question-regarding-search-for-and-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=2338276","commentId":2338276,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1470129386,"content":"Vilya ignore all the cost, but this additional \"pay 3 leadership ressource\" things is part of the effect and is not part of the cost."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224386-question-regarding-search-for-and-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=2338594","commentId":2338594,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1470145619,"content":"> Vilya ignore all the cost, but this additional \"pay 3 leadership ressource\" things is part of the effect and is not part of the cost.\n\n \n\nOk.
