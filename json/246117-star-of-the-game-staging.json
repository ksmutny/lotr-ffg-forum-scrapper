Therefore its When Revealed effects do not trigger. Any Forced effects on the card of the form \"When this card enters play\" or similar will trigger. Whether a particular keyword triggers or not will be defined in the rules of the keyword: does it refer to being revealed or not? The standard keywords Doomed, Surge, Guarded all specifically reference being revealed, so none of these trigger when a card is merely added to the staging area."}]}
