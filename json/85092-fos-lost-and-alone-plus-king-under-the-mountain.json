Therefore, I would rule that if you took your hero into hand via use of King Under the Mountain, you should be able to put it into play.\nHowever, if you had two heroes in your deck and found both of them with the same use of King Under the Mountain, then you'd have to choose one to put into play and the other to be discarded.\nI'm afraid those are the kinds of hard decisions that a king of dwarves must make…\nCheers,\nCaleb\"\n\nSo there you have it.
