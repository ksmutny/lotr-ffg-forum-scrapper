I assume Nate's ruling of the attchments when revealed effects not happening is still correct since the article didn't say anything. Does revealing the objective card cause the guarded keyword to now be resolved normally (i.e. reveal and attach) or does that cause some other issue I am not thinking about?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55580-the-necromancers-tower/?do=findComment&comment=549739","commentId":549739,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1320068581,"content":"You're not the only one who found that errata confusing (I did too).  But I think revealing the objective cards makes it clear that the guarded keyword resolves normally.  So the text attaching the encounter cards to the objectives is just a reminder to execute the guarded keyword (I could, of course, be wrong)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55580-the-necromancers-tower/?do=findComment&comment=549776","commentId":549776,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1320072004,"content":"radiskull said:\n\n[...] I think revealing the objective cards makes it clear that the guarded keyword resolves normally.  So the text attaching the encounter cards to the objectives is just a reminder to execute the guarded keyword (I could, of course, be wrong).\n\n\n\nYes, that's for sure, the 3 cards guarding the objectives now have their \"When revealed\" effect resolved.
