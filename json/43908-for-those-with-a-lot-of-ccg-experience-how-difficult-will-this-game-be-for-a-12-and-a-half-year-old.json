Having read the rules, I don't see this game being any different. However, I don't see this game being a problem, even for a 12 year old, especially if she is a \"smart cookie\" and has gaming experience. Especially being a cooperative game, there's no problem with the two of you playing it together and you being able to help her with some of the more complex rules. On a personal level, I have taught extremely complicated TCGs (VS System) to people that I thought it might be over the head of, and was pleasantly surprised. Again, there will be a learning curve, but it might surprise you how quickly people can pick up on the strategies and intricacies of a CCG."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43908-for-those-with-a-lot-of-ccg-experience-how-difficult-will-this-game-be-for-a-12-and-a-half-year-old/?do=findComment&comment=439655","commentId":439655,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1300382447,"content":"I think having the entire turn/action timing structure printed in the back of the book should take away a lot of your potential headaches. The number crunching and resource management will get easier the more the game is played. If she's not afraid to lose a few games initially, you guys should have a real nice time. CCGs can bring out the temper in a lot of people, so be warned. People get invested in the decks they've built. It takes a real willingness to experiment to fully enjoy this style of game, in my opinion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43908-for-those-with-a-lot-of-ccg-experience-how-difficult-will-this-game-be-for-a-12-and-a-half-year-old/?do=findComment&comment=439686","commentId":439686,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1300384738,"content":"Shrapnelsmile said:\n\nGreets all,\n\nMy stepdaughter is pushing 13, and is a smart cookie who enjoys games.

Also, there are \"easy mode\" rules in the rule book. Everyone will have some difficulty when the game first comes out. Plus, the co-op nature of the game will allow you to pick up the slack for her if she has problems (or vice versa, it's always possible) "}]}
