Can we PLEASE have these two quests as well? People want to log their entire saga experience and those two quests are part of the saga. \n\nI bet Erkenbrand hasn't been added either which is ridiculous because people probably want to play old quests with him but can't.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132074-can-the-quest-log-please-be-updated-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=1408680","commentId":1408680,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1421392381,"content":"Log it on the paper while you're waiting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132074-can-the-quest-log-please-be-updated-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=1408747","commentId":1408747,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1421398644,"content":"People use that thing?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132074-can-the-quest-log-please-be-updated-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=1408763","commentId":1408763,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1421399586,"content":"I'm waiting for it during all last week.... ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132074-can-the-quest-log-please-be-updated-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=1409486","commentId":1409486,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1421437114,"content":"I'm so far behind on the quests that I don't tend to run into trying a quest that doesn't exist. But I do run into using heroes that aren't up there. The way I generally handle that is to put duplicate heroes in the log (For example, I put Legolas, Haldir, Haldir, when I had a Legolas, Haldir, Galadriel deck and Galadriel wasn't released) and then I write a note about who the duplicate is supposed to be. When the hero is released, I go back through my logs looking for duplicate hero pictures and edit them."}]}
