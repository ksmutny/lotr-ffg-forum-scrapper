So, what I own is 2 core sets and both Hobbit saga expansions. And I only used core cards in these decks.\n\n \n\nI played 2 handed in this scenario. Tactics/Lore & Spirit/Leadership. My heroes were Legolas, Gimli and Beravor & Aragorn, Theodred, and Eowyn.\n\n \n\nI managed to beat the scenario in 5 turns. And that included ending up with the Don't Leave the Path segment. I did my first point add up and came up with 70 points. No one died. and there were only 3 damage tokens on my heroes at the end. I had all of the cards in the deck. No easy mode. And I used the Shadow cards. Previously, I had only played easy mode and with no shadow cards. \n\n \n\nIn this short amount of time, I managed to have in play all 3 Stewards of Gondor (they really will let anyone be Steward), Aragorn had his Celebrian's Stone, Gimli had his dwarven axe, and I had 2 Northern Trackers in play. I swear I did not stack the decks. My tactics/Lore deck even had 3 Gandalfs in hand. \n\n \n\nI feel that I could not possibly have another game go as well as this one did.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96940-unbelievable/?do=findComment&comment=955285","commentId":955285,"userName":"Djenni","timestamp":1389823261,"content":"You can only have 1 copy of unique cards (like Steward of Gondor) in play.
