This revised scoring will be implemented at all FFG sanctioned organized play events, and should be used on the LOTR LCG Quest Log available at FantasyFlightGames.com.\nIn addition to all elements currently used to score a game, players also add an additional 10 points to their “final group score” for each round of play that is taken to defeat a scenario. Players tally each round for their score at the end of the refresh phase.\nA modified scoring sheet has been provided as the final page of this document.

If you are punished for extra rounds any slower decks or turtling strategies suffer and would have horrible scores compared to everyone else. I play the game to beat it and have fun not beat it as fast as possible and find the new scoring system just as silly as the old.\n\nBoth have pros and cons in my opinion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128929-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1371183","commentId":1371183,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1418909606,"content":"Who cares at all about that scores? /?
