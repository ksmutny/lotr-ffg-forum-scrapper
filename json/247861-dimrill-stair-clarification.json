Thus, I left the other copies in the encounter deck.   I think the latter is correct but can anyone confirm for me?  Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/247861-dimrill-stair-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=2746735","commentId":2746735,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1492873880,"content":"Dimrill Stair:: Travel: Reshuffle all locations in the discard pile and victory display back into the encounter deck. If you reshuffled at least two locations, reduce each player's threat by 11 and discard all copies of Freezing Cold from play.\n\nSo, it says to discard the ones in play. The ones currently in the encounter deck are not in play, the ones currently attached to your characters are. As such, your second handling was correct."}]}
