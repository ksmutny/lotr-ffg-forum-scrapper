I think we will see the same problem in the upcoming sagas since there will be the \"ring-sphere\". Does anyone think we will see anytime an errata or something for those cards to make them more playable? We will have at least 24 quests where they wouldn't work and imo that's a bit too much.\n\n \n\nWhat's your opinion?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87413-mono-sphere-events-from-druadan-forest-useless/?do=findComment&comment=826039","commentId":826039,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1375137594,"content":"Huh, I had never thought about that.
