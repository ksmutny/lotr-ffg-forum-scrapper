And I like how he is another Lore hero that has a one-off effect of sorts -- like Aragorn or Mirlonde in a way.

With a sufficient drawing, I think it is best to pass on the first copy (unless you have enough Spirit resources) as the second one is already great deal: 2 resources for 2 extra willpower and two readied heroes (of either player) is just amazing.\n\n \n\nAnd I am super excited about the other three events. Of course they will have the same cost, but what will they do? Will they all ready heroes? Giving attack (Tactics) defense (Leadership) and healing (Lore)?\n\n \n\nI had already tried the Navigator.

It makes sense Nenya is cheaper and less powerful because Galadriel can only exhaust for her ability otherwise. It is no easy thing to design Narya, surely. I think they will try to stick to the theme in terms that Vilya is the most powerful of the three but if Narya exhausts Gandalf (or Círdan) it will have to have a very powerful effect too.\n\n \n\nTo recover the top card of the discard pile could be it.
