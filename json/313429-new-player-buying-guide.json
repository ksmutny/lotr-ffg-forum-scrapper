I could recommend starting from The Lost Realm and working from there. Otherwise Wilds of Rhovanion and the Ered Mitrhin cycle are another good place to start. Maybe wait going for Shadow in the East and Vengeance of Mordor until later :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nSpringing for the LOTR saga could be good too."}]}
