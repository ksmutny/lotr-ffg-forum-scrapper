What happens if I attach \"Ancient Mathom\" to a location in the staging area and I get all the progress tokens to it with some other card? It can be Northern Trackers, or whatever. Is the location explored? Can I draw 3 cards?\n\nOr is the location only explored if you first traveled to it?\n\nWhat happens if you first travel to it and then add the progress tokens some other way? Is it explored and I draw cards?\n\nThanks,\n\nJavier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67286-ancient-mathom-explored/?do=findComment&comment=656313","commentId":656313,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1341925583,"content":" You don't have to travel there first.
