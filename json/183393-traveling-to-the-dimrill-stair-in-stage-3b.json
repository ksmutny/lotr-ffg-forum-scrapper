As a consequence, Caradhras left my victory pile and, since it is impossible to travel back to it, the only way of winning the scenario is by travelling to the Dimrill Stair, Celebdil and Fanuidhol (which are the only locations with victory points and you need all of them to sum up to the required 5 points).\n\nAs an advice, don't do it; the game became quite boring. Or allow yourself to travel to Caradhras if you already reached the mountain's peaks (3B).\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183393-traveling-to-the-dimrill-stair-in-stage-3b/?do=findComment&comment=1707947","commentId":1707947,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1438160237,"content":"You can now get some victory point with player cards (Black Arrow...) but yes, travelling to Dimrill Stair is only great at the begining."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183393-traveling-to-the-dimrill-stair-in-stage-3b/?do=findComment&comment=1710096","commentId":1710096,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1438281762,"content":"You can still explore Caradhras while it is in staging area with for instance Northern Tracker, Asfaloth..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183393-traveling-to-the-dimrill-stair-in-stage-3b/?do=findComment&comment=1717403","commentId":1717403,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1438605409,"content":"Yeah, but it will still be placed back from the victory display to be the active location... somewhat helpfull, but not broken."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183393-traveling-to-the-dimrill-stair-in-stage-3b/?do=findComment&comment=1717611","commentId":1717611,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1438613370,"content":"I usually just place enough progress on it whilst in staging so that when it becomes the active location it just takes one turn to clear it"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183393-traveling-to-the-dimrill-stair-in-stage-3b/?do=findComment&comment=1717746","commentId":1717746,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1438617295,"content":"> Yeah, but it will still be placed back from the victory display to be the active location... somewhat helpfull, but not broken.\n\n \n\nI was refering to the situation when it is removed from the victory display in stage 3b when you travel to Dimrill Stair...\n\n \n\n \n\n> I usually just place enough progress on it whilst in staging so that when it becomes the active location it just takes one turn to clear it\n\n \n\nI think you miss the point of the OP....

You simply put 8 progress on it, wait for it to become the active location once you advance to Stage 3 and then clear it. You are right though I did miss the point my bad. Travelling to The Dimrill Stair in stage 3b (after you explore Caradhras on stage 2 or on stage 3 really) after exploring Caradhras will return Caradhras and any other locations in the victory display back to the encounter deck. \n\nPretty brutal really as it resets your victory points and requires you to start again!"}]}
