My inclination would be that the two effects don't occur simultaneously, with the system being\n\n\nX occurs\n  X is the current trigger\n  Choose a Forced effect for this trigger that has not been resolved\n    Resolve this forced effect and any consequences\n    Return to previous level\n  X is the current trigger\n  Choose a Forced effect for this trigger that has not been resolved\n    Etc\n  X is the current trigger\n  Activate a Response effect for this trigger that has not been resolved\n    etc\n  X is the current trigger\n  No further responses\n  Return to the previous level\nPlay continues\n\n\nIn this setup, after the damage is cancelled, we don't return to the \"Enemy has been dealt damage\" trigger but skip straight back to \"Play continues\".\n\n \n\nNo idea whether this is what the designers intend, but it seems a concrete system.\n\nEdited January 4, 2016 by NathanH"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197788-multiple-orc-taskmasters-in-play/?do=findComment&comment=1971060","commentId":1971060,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1451933547,"content":"> Orc-Taskmaster.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Seventh-Level-Nightmare/Orc-Taskmaster.png]\n> \n>  \n> \n> If there are 2 Orc Taskmasters in play, and I deal damage to a Goblin enemy with 2 resources on it, can I remove both resources?\n> \n>  \n> \n> One argument would be that when the damage is dealt both Forced effects trigger simultaneously.
