It does not say to draw a spider from each. The inclusion of the discard pile is to insure you can get the Spawn in case it was sent there during the game.\n\n1b) If the Spawn was currently in play when the card was drawn, you would have to choose another spider. Of course, that wouldn't be a choice, you would be forced to do this.\n\n2) Yes\n\n3) The victory condition is that you must defeat the Spawn. The moment you accomplish this, the game is over. All else is irrelevant.\n\n4)Victory points do not count if a card is used as a shadow card. It must defeated or explored."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55269-some-small-questions/?do=findComment&comment=546851","commentId":546851,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1319496280,"content":"Hi Sacred Voice,\n\n1a) Each player only chooses 1 spider to add to the staging area, and they can choose that spider from either the encounter deck or discard pile.  They don't take one from each.\n\n1b) There is no good reason to not choose Ungoliant's Spawn at that point in the game.\n\n2) You did play it correctly by leaving Gimli exhausted.  I am curious to know why you didn't just have him attack during the combat phase though.\n\n3) The game would end as soon as you kill Ungoliant's Spawn.  The damage dealt by your Gondorian Spearman happens before the step that resolves shadow effects, so even if the shadow card removed your defender the shadow card wouldn't have a chance to resolve before the game ended.\n\n4) While the victory points are below the Shadow bar (whatever it's called) I believe the intention was to gain the victory points only after the card is revealed normally and then defeated.\n\nI hope you continue to enjoy the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55269-some-small-questions/?do=findComment&comment=546852","commentId":546852,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1319496448,"content":"Sacred Voice said:\n\nJust realised that I shouldn't have been able to play Quick Strike on Gimli as it requires an eligible monster to attack yet the monsters drawn from the quest card hadn't engaged me yet.

Something like Ever Vigilant or Grim Resolve. Otherwise, the timing is just not there. The cards refresh and no actions are possible until after that. If you exhaust a character here, it would stay exhausted."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55269-some-small-questions/?do=findComment&comment=564750","commentId":564750,"userName":"adomingo","timestamp":1323191909,"content":"If you had already killed the Ungoliant's Spawn till the point you reached the last card of the quest..do you have to draw it back? and also if there more enemies or locations in the staging area do i have to \"resolve\" them before i yell my victory scream? thanks\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55269-some-small-questions/?do=findComment&comment=564756","commentId":564756,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1323192946,"content":"adomingo said:\n\nIf you had already killed the Ungoliant's Spawn till the point you reached the last card of the quest..do you have to draw it back? and also if there more enemies or locations in the staging area do i have to \"resolve\" them before i yell my victory scream? thanks\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nyes im afraid so.....and no as long as its dead its over"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55269-some-small-questions/?do=findComment&comment=564759","commentId":564759,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1323193422,"content":"Kiwina said:\n\n2) You did play it correctly by leaving Gimli exhausted.  I am curious to know why you didn't just have him attack during the combat phase though.\n\n\n\nMy bet is that he finished stage 2B using Legolas's ability."}]}
