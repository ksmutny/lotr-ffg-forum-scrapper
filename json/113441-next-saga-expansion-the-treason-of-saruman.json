The Lost Realm will be great, it was basically what people were expecting, the northern realms, Angmar, Rangers, evil spirits, pretty cool! Looking forward to this cycle. Treason of Saruman seems like it'll be awesomely epic. Battle of the Hornburg at last! What I'm curious to see is how they'll handle the new Fellowship hero Aragorn. He'll obviously not be a ring-bearer, that's for sure, and since he'll become king later we have to protect him. An equivalent to Frodo ringbearer basically, makes sense. But how will this work with the other Frodo saga heroes? I suppose you still have to have a ring-bearer, but at the same time Aragorn? How will that work?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113441-next-saga-expansion-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1202357","commentId":1202357,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1408123067,"content":"I'm obviously aware of how the storyline proceeds; I was trying to convey rather how I found it interesting that it seems they will leave out a \"ring-bearer\" rather than trying to work Frodo and Sam's journey in just for the sake of doing it but firmly splitting each saga expansion as each \"book\" is"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113441-next-saga-expansion-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1202398","commentId":1202398,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1408123417,"content":"Didn't we get some card spoilers or back of the box spoilers from \"voice of Isen\" at last years gen-con?
