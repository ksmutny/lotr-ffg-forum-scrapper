I the new sub-set of actions is still pretty new sorry.\n\n \n\nI'll try to step by step it....\n\n * Quick Strike is targeting the playe'rs CHARACTER, not the immune card\n * That initialises the \"player attack sub-phase\" of a combat round.\n * This is just like a normal attack in a normal combat round.\n * The player card event is not targeting the immune card at any time, it is using the combat round rules to select the target of the attack.\n * This is an example of a \"non-targeted\" effect. As while .. yes it it HITS a target.. there was no selecting of the target outside of normal rules. All quick strike did was play that combat step out of round.\n * You wouldn't expect \"immune to player cards\" to mean you can not attack them in a normal combat round would you?\n\nMeanwhile...\n\n \n\n * Hands Upon the Bow as part of its cost requires a targeting for the event, AND to tap a player character.\n * So if the card is immune it can not be selected as a target and thus the effect fizzles.\n\nYes it is pretty similar but it IS different and the design space needs to recognise this for the game to make sense. You see this a lot in card games. The easiest way to think of this is that QuickStrike has no conditional text about the target, meaning there is no target.. you can just attack anything legal... but Hands Upon the Bow can only attack certain targets.. targets you need to nominate in a special way outside of the normal combat round rules. The rules that allow you to target out side those rules is on the player card's event text.. that is a player card effect.. and encounter cards can be immune to that.\n\n \n\nThat is pretty much it.. so like kinda like I said..\n\n \n\nOne is a TARGET effect, the other triggers a NON-TARGETED effect.\n\nEdited February 7, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98638-and-a-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=976625","commentId":976625,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1391755960,"content":"No, no, no, you are supposed to say, \"Grandspleen, you are right.  The wording on the two cards is identical.  This is ridiculous, but we must let it be.\"\n\n \n\nOK, so maybe not... but anyway, all we can do is be apologists for the ruling.  The card text on both cards is written nearly identically.  The motivation was clearly to exclude Hands from being used on Immune characters, but they tackled the problem from a weird angle.  \n\n \n\n>  * Hands Upon the Bow as part of its cost requires a targeting for the event, AND to tap a player character.\n\n \n\nThat's not right, the cost for neither card requires targeting.  I don't think I am missing any errata, but Hands is written:\n\n \n\nAction: Exhaust a character you control with ranged to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against an enemy in the staging area.

Think about it: by a similar logic, if a treachery asked you to deal 1 damage to each ally in play or raise your threat, and you have no allies in play, you can't just say, \"i'm dealing 1 damage to zero allies\". It's been made clear in the past (and in this FAQ) that you have to fulfill one. You can't pick an option that has no gameplay impact."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98638-and-a-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=977688","commentId":977688,"userName":"Mika Mika","timestamp":1391816502,"content":"Actually, this new FAQ totally answers one of the real questions that really matter : \n\n \n\nfaqere11.jpg [http://i58.servimg.com/u/f58/18/52/83/63/faqere11.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98638-and-a-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=977743","commentId":977743,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1391818135,"content":"I was hoping the FAQ would explain the Planning action of Haunted Valley from Stone of Erech.\n\n \n\nWhile this location is in the staging area, all ready heroes lose all [Lore], [Leadership], [spirit], and [Tactics] icons.\nPlanning Action: Exhaust a hero.
