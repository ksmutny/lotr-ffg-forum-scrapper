Complete waste. Also if the locations you remove with Leave no Trace do not appear a second time they also cannot be countered by The Door is Closed. Keen as Lances will hopefully only cost one resource or even none as if it costs more than 1 its first effect is useless (add two resources to a hero). 1 or 2 cost to reduce threat by 4 is not bad at all and one cost to draw 3 cards is also pretty nifty. So long as you don't need the resource option you only need 3+ cards in the victory display worth no victory points to make Keen as Lances worthwhile. Also Keen of Lances powers itself up as well as it is added to the victory display yet is worth no points so makes other copies cheaper. \n\nAs well as this with Leave no Trace you got to avoid a nasty location early on and with out of the wild you removed a nasty card that may have entered staging and ruined your day. Without secrecy out of the wild costs a whopping three resources however... As much as these cards have the potential to come together I really don't see it being very reliable or often enough to be worthwhile. \n\n \n\nEssentially there just aren't enough cards yet for this to be very powerful or useful in my opinion especially for solo play like others have mentioned in which you do not cycle through the encounter deck anywhere near as fast as multiplayer/two handed. Also if you aren't in secrecy Out of the Wild costs way too much. If you haven't used as least a copy or two of Out of the Wild or Leave no Trace then Keen as Lances costs too much and is useless. As for The Door is Closed, I find it to be the weakest card out of this archetype thus far as it can easily fail or never be playable even in games in which you have successfully played both Out of the Wild and Leave no Trace, the nasty cards you put a copy of in the victory display may just never appear again or only appear as shadow cards. Unless they add a few more cards that are more flexible to this archetype and soon I personally don't think I'll bother trying it out, at least not without secrecy which I don't really play. I guess one idea would be to add in cards to a deck featuring this archetype/combo that allow you to look at or even order the top few cards of the encounter deck like Palantir and Risk some Light giving you a little more chance to actually use The Door is Closed effectively. \n\nLoving the new art and encounter cards, just a little bit eh on this new mechanic thus far but have high hopes for it and that we are given a few more cards that make it more worthwhile/powerful. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136678-escape-from-mount-gram/?do=findComment&comment=1474656","commentId":1474656,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1425433862,"content":"That neutral card is bless!

Do note that playing a single copy of Leave No Trace reduces the cost of Keen as Lances by 2. So if you manage to play 2 and maybe a Out of the Wild or a 1-3 cost Keen as Lances. That's 5 cards, 0 cost Keen as Lances. Imagine if all 3-4 decks had 3 Keen as Lances, that's amazing free power.\n\n \n\nNot to mention the Dunedain rangers seem to be manipulating the encounter deck to their favour, the Dunedain hunter puts things engaged with you getting them out of the encounter deck and making sure their threat doesn't hit the table. Sarn Ford sentry with sneak attack for a bunch of card draw and then ranger summons to add some good cards to the encounter deck. Have a hero set up of something like Aragorn(T)/Sam/Denethor. I can see that kind of deck being a wonderful support structure for the other decks playing.\n\n \n\nAlso if I am not reading the rules wrong, since the enemy you draw from the deck using a Dunedain ranger is 'put into play' and not revealed thus you forgo any bad when revealed effects from a nasty creature you just don't like.\n\n \n\nOf course saying that in a single player game since the deck doesn't roll over that quick it's not as great. Though just playing in a solo game you can still do something like:\n\nDunedain ranger > enemy into play > Distant stars > Get a location you don't like as the active > Quick strike > Kill enemy > Expert tracker + Engage something else from staging area (Aragorn) > Leave no tracks > remove location from game (2 cards in display).\n\n \n\nThat costs something like 2 resources to do. 1 lore and 1 tactics. You could also add some nifty combo like sneak attacking in a Sarn Ford Sentry just before you use expert tracker to draw a card from the engaged enemy and exhaust her to use expert tracker. Then set your self up for your next turn travelling to a new location, exploring it using another Leave no tracks getting 4 cards in the display. Then your first Keen as Lances is cost 1 the next two are 0. All that is just speculative strategies as there will know doubt be another Dunedain hero that helps these tactics to work, I'm guessing Halbarad will be a leadership or lore hero.\n\n \n\nI'm just excited to see what else the Dunedain can do. As much as it might be a finicky tactic, there are players that like that sort of thing. They'll be more than happy in multiplayer pulling off something like the above and getting rid of stuff other players don't want to deal with.\n\nEdited March 4, 2015 by Davachido"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136678-escape-from-mount-gram/?do=findComment&comment=1475161","commentId":1475161,"userName":"Davachido","timestamp":1425468945,"content":"> Hmmmmmm not so sure about the whole victory display manipulation thing just yet.\n> \n> As it exists now there are four cards that go together, Out of the Wild, The Door is Closed, Leave no Trace and Keen as Lances.\n> \n> x3 copies of both out of the wild and leave no trace seems crucial as you essentially want to play at least one copy of each early game removing a nasty location from play and putting it in the victory display along with leave no trace as well as putting a nasty treachery or enemy into the victory display with Out of the Wild so that you have at least 3 or more cards in your victory display to be able to play Keen as Lances as cheaply as possible and so that you have a few especially nasty encounter cards in your victory display and can cancel any additional copies of these cards that appear with The Door is Closed.\n\n \n\nI'm curious you talk about The Door is Closed! here, have you worked out the wording of it?

I remember playing MTG; once things were spoiled, my friends and I immediately printed them out and began playing with them. It made opening packs less exciting.
