Once the card pool gets larger and the power creep makes the quest easier I think it will become a legit solo game, for now though it just isn't.\n\nThe only way to really beat this quest, as people have said already, is to make a Rohan super questing deck and basically beeline for the finish as fast as possible and hope you get a good encounter draw. This is of course NOT playing the game. You do not really do anything, your deck building is next to meaningless as you draw like a tiny portion of your cards, the scenario is won or lost on pure luck. What you are basically doing is just drawing encounter cards, if it is a bad one you loose if you get a good draw you win.. There is no \"playing\".. no decision making.. just place quest power toons and hope you get though in time.\n\nThat is ******* stupid.\n\nAs I said once the card pool gets larger power creep may make this quest worth playing solo, but for now it is easily the worst solo game, yes, worse than Guldur, as I think that is a legitimate quest.\n\nI've made a small rule modification that you can do to the rules to make this quest much more fun for solo players.\n\n1) Make the card \"Woodsmen Glade\" remove 2 threat after exploration for solo games. At the moment this card has no effect for solo players.\n\n2) I also have a custom rule for the Gollum card itself.. it sounds complex, but it really isn't... Basically Gollum adds 1 threat every round to your normal per turn threat gain. Though you also add 3 counters to Gollums card. Every time you hit 5 counters, you add 2 threat instead. If you have 4 counters on Gollum and add 3, you only need 1 to make 5, so remove all counters and add 2. In other words the excess counters carry on.. exactly like quest counters spilling over from travel location to the main quest...\n\nIt breaks down into a 5 turn cycle.... and looks like this....\n\n\n1 - ??? - 1 Threat (3 counters is less than 5 so you get the default 1 Threat)\n2 - ???-?? = 2 Threat (There was three counters, so you add 2 this makes it 5.. so you add 2 threat this round. You still have one counter left over so you place that)\n3 - ?-??? = 1 Threat (There is 1 counter left from last round, you add 3, it is under 5.. so default 1 threat)\n4 - ????-? = 2 Threat (There is 4 counter left from last round, add 3 counter. Adding 1 counter makes 5.. so add 2 threat, and leave the other 2 on the card)\n5 - ??-??? = 2 Threat (There is 2 counters on the card, add 3, this is 5, so you add 2 threat)\n6 - The pattern repeats.\n\nIt looks kinda complicated when I type it out.. but it is really simple.. just place a counters on Gollum.. if there is 5, add 2 threat instead of 1. Extra counters over 5 spill to next round\n\nAnyway.. what this dose is about 1/2 the threat gain from Gollum. By default rules over 5 round you gain 15 threat. This method you only gain 8. Also it is a little lopsided, so you get some round that are \"less stress\" as lower threat gain.\n\nAnd that is it, this is my custom rules for this as a solo quest. I strongly suggest you try it. By slowing down the threat gain, and allowing the threat reduction cards that only function in multioplayer games to work in solo the entire game lasts longer and allows you to enjoy the experience of building a deck and facing the challenged of the encounter deck and PLAYING the game, witch at the moment is NOT what happens when you build a super quest spirit deck.\n\nGive it a go, make a deck, fight those monsters, explore and have fun... something I think is not possible in the original version. I am open to improvements to this if you have any.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ni see your point but i disagree.....this is a tense quest and that brings the fun....knowing that 1 bad encounter card draw and its over, i agree though, this is certainly not for solo, unless the quest designer was on some serious long bottom leaf at the time.\n\nps what happened to your post??\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58807-solo-deck-for-return-to-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=578171","commentId":578171,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1326297290,"content":"Return is the best solo quest that we have so far.

You get to draw more player cards, more encounter cards, face awesome monsters, use all your tricks.. get time to set up your resource and/or draw engines.... it is still pretty hard with his rules, the threat gain is still there , although depleted, and as the game is longer, you are guaranteed to draw some ubr monsters, witch is really fun.\n\nJust because you play a rule variant, dose not mean you are \"rejecting\" the original rules.. it is just another way to play the scenario to get a different experience.. enhancing and/or extending the life of the game.
