Does he generate 2 ressources now or does the song just add one green ressource to an attached non-green-sphere-hero?\n\n \n\nThanks alot!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93892-question-about-songs/?do=findComment&comment=913999","commentId":913999,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1385063067,"content":"Still just one the resource.\n\n \n\nThe song cards, that give the attached hero the sphere icon of the card, don't give extra resources they allow the attached hero to spend resources on the attached songs sphere as well as their own.\n\n \n\ni.e. Attaching a green song to a blue Hero would allow the blue hero's resources to be spent on blue or green cards, not just blue.\n\n \n\nChuckles\n\nEdited November 21, 2013 by chuckles"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93892-question-about-songs/?do=findComment&comment=914371","commentId":914371,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1385104184,"content":"As a small side comment, songs are not limited to the attachments that give resource icons:\n\n \n\nmed_durins-song-kd.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_durins-song-kd.jpg]med_song-of-earendil-rtr.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_song-of-earendil-rtr.jpg]\n\nmed_song-of-mocking-tdm.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_song-of-mocking-tdm.jpg]\n\n \n\nThese all pair well with\n\nmed_love-of-tales-tld.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_love-of-tales-tld.jpg]\n\n \n\nEspecially if you can convince your co-players to include some of the songs as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93892-question-about-songs/?do=findComment&comment=914442","commentId":914442,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1385120338,"content":"I keep wanting to build a deck that uses love of tales & the other song cards... just haven't managed to come of with a plan for a deck that makes sense to me to use.
