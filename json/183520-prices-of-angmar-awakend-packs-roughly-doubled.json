Have you heard anything about our currency recently? It was 5:1 ratio with dollar not so long ago, now it's 22-24:1 due to the recent events. Not only the prices have skyrocketed for me, but the local retailer now refuses to preorder the game and I need to pay for them to order the pack I want in the first place, and then wait 1-2 months until it arrives. And I understand why, and I'm sane enough to comprehend that FFG has nothing to do with this.

Thought about exchange rate, too. But then I wonder why the old packs still cost the same (more or less - they increased but only a little). Also, I thought about general inflation. But that would alter the prices listed on ffg.com, too. Anyway, both effects summed up could not compensate the doubling I see here and there. It might have something to do with the new packaging???"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183520-prices-of-angmar-awakend-packs-roughly-doubled/?do=findComment&comment=1709247","commentId":1709247,"userName":"jnicol","timestamp":1438241176,"content":"A reason that the old packs might not have increased in price is that your local supplier purchased them before the U.S. Dollar got so strong. The new packs cost the supplier more, since your currency has weakened, and that price increase is passed on to the customer.\n\nI purchased Khazad Dum and the Dwarroldelf APs today in anticipation of price increases here in Australia. A few years back our currency was 1:1 with the US dollar, but it's on a downward slide and tipped to fall to 60 cents by the end of the year.\n\nEdited July 30, 2015 by jnicol"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183520-prices-of-angmar-awakend-packs-roughly-doubled/?do=findComment&comment=1720860","commentId":1720860,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1438755553,"content":"One of the largest game stores here has as of recently increased the expansion price from about €24 to €30 and AP price from €12 to €15.
