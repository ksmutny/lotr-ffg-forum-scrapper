Those are way smaller than the current thick ones we get and open from the side only. I usually store an entire cycle in its corresponding deluxe box. It would be kinda annoying if FFG breaks the tradition here.. Unfortunately it seems that this will be the case, since every other LCG already works like that... \n\nEdited October 11, 2018 by Gandalf_"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284380-will-lotr-lcg-get-lower-quality-boxes-as-well/?do=findComment&comment=3500570","commentId":3500570,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1539305192,"content":"How do you fit the cards from it and the entire cycle in the deluxe box?!

Do they really not damage cards?
