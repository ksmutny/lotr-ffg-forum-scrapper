So what good does it for me when I can engage an enemy in the planning phase? I won't get to fight him until later anyway? Or does this only work with Sneak Attack...but even then, the only thing I can see is that I will be able to engage two enemies instead of just one...is that it? Or am I just blind? I played a couple of rounds and this guy seemed really useless to me!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45494-rules-question-son-of-arnor/?do=findComment&comment=456319","commentId":456319,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1303284859,"content":"It means that you can take an enemy out of the Staging area before you Quest.
