The key cards are \"Parting Gifts\" / \"Zigil Miner\" / \"Will of the West\" / \"Dwarven Tomb\" / \"Stand and Fight\". The idea is for your draw engine to pull Ziggy into your had as fast as possible, if you get it in set up 6, then your laughing. The vast majority of cards in the deck are (5) cost, I put the costs in brackets after the card names in the list. You simple use Ziggy's ability and call 5 every time. You normally hit that. Soon you are rolling in resources, resources that you pile on a single hero. Then the goal is to use \"Parting Gifts\" to send mass resources to your mates side of the room, or simply pay for your out laddish cards. Use \"Dwarven Tomb\" to exhume will of the west so you always have one in hand. If you discard both of them, do not worry, you have 3 Tomb's to get one back. You can increase your odds by putting in 3. Your going to be discarding a lot of cards, so \" Stand and Fight\" will allow you to play from your yard.\n\nAnd that is pretty much it.. very simple.. but SOOOOOooOOOOOooo broken. I transferred 38 resources to my mates in our first test game, and I also have all the big 5 cost boys on my table. I had a turn 1 game were my partner used 10 resources and emptied his hand onto the table. It is crazy. Think about a draw deck.. but being able to PLAY every card not just discard to fule protector.\n\nThere are some things the other deck needs to do, and one is to run songs. You need to place a tactic and leadership song on one of Ziggy's heroes. It also really helped for the 2nd player to run a draw engine to allow Ziggy to dig for its namesake card. Lastly, We ran the Dwarf God on the 2nd players team also played Protector on one of Ziggys Heroes so he could empty his had at every opportunity and cycle it back in with \"Will of the West\". If you get a \"Will of the West\" and 2 \"Dwarven Tomb\" in your hand.. your laughing.\n\nGive it a go.. it is pretty fun, though kinda broken.

I'd go with Eowyn, Frodo and Eleanor.\n\nWith Eowyn, you are able to discard and effectively make use of Stand and Fight (too bad it doesn't work on Gandalf).\n\nNot sure about the 6-cost guys however. Since you want to call 5 with the Miner anyway, you could swap them for 3 Northern Tracker and maybe 3 Ancient Mathoms. Parting Gift can also be removed for Song of Kings as you will want to be able to sneak Gandalf in. I'd also remove Gandalf's Search and add Unexpected Courage instead. Rumours from the Earth becomes your 3rd Will of the West.\n\nObviously, playing a Dwarf character would allow you to use the new Belt for full-multicolor production, but you'd still need Song of Kings to play the Belt in the first place, so not 100 % sure...\n\nThe main challenge will be fighting. Too many early enemies will put pressure on you, but you can try to delay with Frodo not taking damage and ganging enemies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59053-dose-this-deck-break-multiplayer-ziggy/?do=findComment&comment=580454","commentId":580454,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1326746248,"content":" @booored:  dude, other than one minor glitch we caught a round later and sort of self-corrected, I just modified your deck and one of my hobbits and I beat the 7th level!  (I'd won solo, but we haven't won as a duo or trio yet.).

While there was a deck from Tragic when ziggy was released that was designed for solo it is not a particularly great solo deck.. I mean you will hardly EVER loose.. but your scores will not be that good.. in a normal game though this is not true. in it full form as a support deck in multiplayer it is pretty insane."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59053-dose-this-deck-break-multiplayer-ziggy/?do=findComment&comment=634279","commentId":634279,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1337665103,"content":"the arguement has indeed been done to death and more, but it still remains that the points for a counter argument are getting less and less….with each of the cards that help the zigil deck it gets stronger and stronger, stargazer just completely boosts its usefulness tenfold\n\nas ive said i dont use it, however i still agree with style75-its fuel to the zigil fire"}]}
