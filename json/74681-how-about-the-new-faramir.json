Still, I cannot help the curiosity, so be with me whoever enjoys the guessing game.\n\nNow, we've got a Boromir as a allround attack boost. The original Faramir ally was an allround willpower boost. And of course, one can combine them together in a Leadership oriented deck. But do you think the designers will go with it for the hero version as well, or will they provide a more solitary version of the brother, similar to the original Boromir? I would think so and I feel it shall be a Lore Ranger.\n\nAny other ideas?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74681-how-about-the-new-faramir/?do=findComment&comment=727107","commentId":727107,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1353674398,"content":"i also think lore, he was wiser than his brother. i think he will be able to give some sort of aid to defense and protection\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74681-how-about-the-new-faramir/?do=findComment&comment=727126","commentId":727126,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1353678928,"content":"richsabre said:\n\ni also think lore, he was wiser than his brother. i think he will be able to give some sort of aid to defense and protection\n\nrich\n\n\n\nThe history rights by  people like Boromir.

I would not outright say Boromir is the most interesting character in the story, but for me he is surely among them, one of the first that come to mind. I have a strong feeling for the whole tragedy of the family though.\n\nAs for the game, I hope Faramir comes with higher willpower stat than his ally version since he will not likely be able to boost others anymore. If any Gondor character should have willpower of 3, it may well be Faramir."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74681-how-about-the-new-faramir/?do=findComment&comment=727130","commentId":727130,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1353679688,"content":"Mighty Jim said:\n\n Boromir tried to take the ring\n\nFaramir didn't (and don't let Peter Jackson convince you he even thought about it much)\n\n therefore, Faramir was clearly both wiser and much less \"weak\"\n\n\n\nBut do think of the situations they were in.

Not as strictly as do Elrond's twins, but that there is a clear combo without printing Boromir's name on the card. As much as I like the current Boromir version, the ability is a little bleak and Faramir could spice things up. I just cannot myself see how; and even if I did, it would mean little."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74681-how-about-the-new-faramir/?do=findComment&comment=728357","commentId":728357,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1354028479,"content":"Boromir is my second favorite character in Middle-Earth, he is strong, he is bold and he is honorable - in the eyes of every Gondorian, at least.\nFaramir has a lot of Willpower, I remember somewhere in the book where he has the chance to get the ring and he refuses it, so, in a game sense, I would put him with 3-4 willpower, high defense and low attack even though he was a nice ranger."}]}
