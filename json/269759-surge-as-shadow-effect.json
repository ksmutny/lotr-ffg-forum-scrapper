I should have read the whole post more carefully. Yeah, since its embedded in the When Revealed, you have to Surge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/269759-surge-as-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=3216051","commentId":3216051,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1518735944,"content":"I expect the intention is for it to surge, but a strict reading of the rules suggests it would not. The card certainly gains surge, but does that do anything? According to the FAQ, surge takes effect when a card is revealed. But the card is not being revealed, it is merely having its When Revealed effect triggered. As far as I can see, it can gain surge as much as it likes, but all the surges in the world don't trigger unless the card is actually revealed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/269759-surge-as-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=3216326","commentId":3216326,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1518758521,"content":"A fair point.

Does it solve the problem? Not really since we are not revealing cards so revealing an additional card don't necessary take sense.\n\nWe agree about the fact that the spirit is to reveal a card anyway. So even if the rules as we know them don't reveal a card I'm pretty sure that Caleb would rule to reveal one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/269759-surge-as-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=3216592","commentId":3216592,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1518788175,"content":"So the thing to do is treat the surge like it says to in the FAQ, and not the core rulebook. It still bugs me that it says \"after a card with surge is revealed from the encounter deck.\"\n\nIt's clear that the card is intended to surge, but the rules make it hard to be sure."}]}
