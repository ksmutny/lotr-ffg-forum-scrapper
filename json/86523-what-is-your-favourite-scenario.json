(Have not yet played the Khazad-Dûm scenarios.) I beat the Watcher in the Water today. I'd heard very good things about it, and sure, it was a fun quest. Kept me a bit on the edge with all the tentacle damage and I lost a hero, which I usually don't, but it was good all the same. (Never managed to engage the Watcher, but gained victory points from the Doors of Durin.)\n\n \n\nI'm now looking forward to entering Moria, but I will probably do that with some friends. Not yet played any APs from Shadows of Mirkwood. I've heard various opinions about the Hobbit expansions and Heirs of Númenor and their APs.\n\n \n\nWhat is your favourite scenario to date, and why?\n\nEdited July 17, 2013 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86523-what-is-your-favourite-scenario/?do=findComment&comment=816005","commentId":816005,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1374068891,"content":"redhorn gate. im a big tolkien fan and i play the game for that reason. therefore theme plays a big part. some quests have a better theme than others and redhorn gate is one of the best. the fellowship's journey through the mountains is one of my favourite parts of the book, so its a perfect quest.\n\n \n\nit also has some of the best art in the game, mountain goblins is exactly like i imagine them.\n\n \n\nthe quest is also challenging but not overly so, and keeps its challenge in both solo and multiplay\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86523-what-is-your-favourite-scenario/?do=findComment&comment=821755","commentId":821755,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1374760082,"content":"TCG's artwork is really amazing! I have not yet decided what my favourite scenario is, but it's definitely not Peril in Pelargir. It's probably more fun when you've figured it out and everyone has a strong deck, but me and my friend were recently crushed by the thugs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86523-what-is-your-favourite-scenario/?do=findComment&comment=822728","commentId":822728,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1374808600,"content":"Did you see the other topic on this on the main page of the forum?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86523-what-is-your-favourite-scenario/?do=findComment&comment=822833","commentId":822833,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1374825114,"content":"I have not, no.
