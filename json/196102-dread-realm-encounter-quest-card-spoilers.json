My first game was a 2 player game, and during 5 rounds, we were discarding one sorcery, just to see another one appearing next round... finally we gave it up, being so tired of the quest...\n\n \n\nAnyway, playing it in solo is fun, and being a hard quest, I believe it is slightly easier than Carn Dûm"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196102-dread-realm-encounter-quest-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1941180","commentId":1941180,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1450372862,"content":"I assumed running Gondorian Spearman with dat 2costed Spear attachment for Reanimated Dead instakills.
