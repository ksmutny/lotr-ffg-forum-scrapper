Short answer:\n\nYes, you have played it right.\n\nHad you drawn another copy of Valiant Sacrifice via the first one, you could even play that as well.\n\nHowever, some of your rationale is incorrect.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.\n\n \n\n> I know I have a chance to play cards between the revealing and resolving of a shadow effect, since there is at least one card (Hasty Stroke) that let us cancel shadow effects.  However, the ally doesn't leave play  until the resolving, so the timing is different than the timing used for Hasty Stroke.\n\n \n\nThis is incorrect assumption.\n\n \n\nThere are 2 major things to consider while playing/activating card effect.\n\n \n\n1) Card Type\n\nUnless another card effect allows it (such as Vilya, Kili/Fili, Very Good Tale), you may only play allies and attachments during planning phase.\n\n \n\n2) Type of Effect\n\nActions may be triggered almost anytime at the beginning or end of phase, or after each step of each phase.\n\nResponse can only be triggered when certain conditions are met.\n\n \n\nShadow card part of combat is NOT two part steps, but rather one step; you reveal AND resolve shadow card - that's only ONE step.\n\n \n\nTherefore normally you would not be able to play an Action during revealing and resolving shadow card (since it is one interruptable step), however Valiant Sacrifce and Hasty Stroke are RESPONSE effects, not action; therefore it is legal to play those cards as soon as the conditions are met.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. There is a window to play Actions after completely resolving Shadow Effect and before assigning Combat Damage, so you could've played an action after your ally was discarded via shadow effect and before Hill Troll took out your Gloin.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Horn of Gondor's response effect does NOT trigger immediately after the character leaves play; it triggers AFTER any FORCED effects that must be triggered via character leaving play (if any) and then first player gets to decide which responses that trigger off character leaving play in any order they choose (so you could choose to get a resource from Horn of Gondor then play Valiant Sacrifice, or choose to play Valiant Sacrifice first then get resource from Horn of Gondor).\n\n \n\n \n\n5. Triggering of Response effects does not open an action window. You may play as many relevent responses as you wish (play -> resolve, then play -> resolve, not play all at once then resolve all at once), but you may not trigger any Actions if said responses were triggered during Staging Step of quest phase or Reveal & Resolve Shadow effect of combat phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91412-combat-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=880170","commentId":880170,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1380752593,"content":"Thanks for the clarification.\n\n \n\n> Shadow card part of combat is NOT two part steps, but rather one step; you reveal AND resolve shadow card - that's only ONE step.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Therefore normally you would not be able to play an Action during revealing and resolving shadow card (since it is one interruptable step), however Valiant Sacrifce and Hasty Stroke are RESPONSE effects, not action; therefore it is legal to play those cards as soon as the conditions are met.\n\nI think this is the key part.  Both Valiant Sacrifice and Brok Ironfist had \"Response\" actions, which is why they were allowed to be played in the middle of the [atomic] shadow card step.  I could not have played, say, a healing effect or Sneak Attack at that time.  Correct?\n\n \n\n> 3. There is a window to play Actions after completely resolving Shadow Effect and before assigning Combat Damage, so you could've played an action after your ally was discarded via shadow effect and before Hill Troll took out your Gloin.\n\nOkay, so I could have still played Sneak Attack after the ally was killed and before Gloin was killed.  Not that Sneak Attack would do any good.  (I'm just using it as an example of an event card without a Response). \n\n \n\nOut of curiosity, are there any event cards that can either reduce undefended damage (6 from the troll) or boost hero hit points (Gloin only had 4)?  Or was Gloin a goner (seeing that I didn't want to get rid of Dain or Bifur)?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91412-combat-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=880404","commentId":880404,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1380776506,"content":"> Out of curiosity, are there any event cards that can either reduce undefended damage (6 from the troll) or boost hero hit points (Gloin only had 4)?  Or was Gloin a goner (seeing that I didn't want to get rid of Dain or Bifur)?\n\n \n\nGloin is a goner, unless he happened to have Steward of Gondor attached and someone could play two copies of the tactics event \"Gondorian Discipline\" (from Encounter at Amon Din) which reads: \"Response: Cancel up to 2 points of damage just dealt to a Gondor character\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91412-combat-timing-question/?do=findComment&comment=880460","commentId":880460,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1380783569,"content":"Well in the case of Gloin, Durin´s Song X 2 could also have saved him.\n\n \n\n \n\n> 4.

Players may play event cards and take actions at the end of each step\"\n\n \n\nMeaning that after a shadow card, with an effect that affects the attacking enemy´s attack value, you would still have a chance to play relevant events to save the character. Even though the bonus to the enemy attack is applied immediately, the effect of that bonus does not truly manifest itself untill the \"determine combat damage\" step.\n\nIf the shadow card said \"deal 2 damage to defending character\" or then you would get no such opportunity because this is something that happens immediately."}]}
