So if the effect says to make you destroy an attachment it would still do so simply because Even though he isn't hitting you in the face the shadow effect is still active. It's rough but at least even though he is not going to attack you you can still choose a defender before playing faint. So you will be able to use your Gondorian Spearman to deal a damage and not take any, or play swift strike.

Since the Enemy never attacks that step never happens. The Shadow card would just be discarded at the end combat phase. At least that is how I read it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45597-feint-ruling-question/?do=findComment&comment=457728","commentId":457728,"userName":"bharrington73","timestamp":1303484844,"content":"From Rulebook on Page 18:\n\nAt the beginning of the combat phase, the players deal 1 Shadow card to each engaged enemy.\n\nThis occurs before you choose an enemies attack to resolve.

So once again we can only guess the designers intent as the term \"attack\" is loosely defined.\n\nAs it sits it would translate that an attack is all the steps combined. so if a creature \"cannot attack\" the steps are skipped. However the biggest issue with this card is the timing, because in order for you to play an action you have to first choose an attack which is the 1st step in the \"attack\" sequence. And only after this step are you able to play actions.\n\nSo really we just need to know the designers intent as the definition of \"attack\" is fairly obscure. And until we get a shout out from the man, we will have to speculate. and my opinion is that you're right."}]}
