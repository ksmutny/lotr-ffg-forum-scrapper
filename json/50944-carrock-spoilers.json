First of all you don't want to finish stage 1B , because flipping to stage 2B means you have to face 4 trolls (10hp, big armor, big attack, when they attack threat goes up 3 for each attacking troll). The fight is so devastating that you need to prepare for it. But it is not easy, you may accidently complete 1B (only 7 progress needed) and you are dead. Or sooner or later you will encounter sacked card and this is like instant kill of one of the hereos (1 hero is trapped and can do absolutely anything until 1 troll is killed, this also means that your preparation phase for the troll fight is much much harder, especially if you play 2 or 3 sphere deck). Then, you need to also have low threat since when 4 trolls are attacking your threat will go up 12. It is not easy to lower your threat below 34 and pick trolls 1 by one because each troll have threat 2 so once they hit the board, the questing becomes quite hard and encounter deck have some more cards that can instantly rise the threat resulting in a nighmare fight.\n\n \n\nObviously, just like anduin quest, players will find answers how to beat the quest constantly. However, I feel that deck that beats Carrock may have trouble beating other scenarios, so optimising the deck so it can beat multiple scenarios will be becoming harder and harder with each expansion.\n\n "}]}
