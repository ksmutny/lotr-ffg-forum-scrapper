There is Theodred I suppose who could give 1+1 resources as far as Heroes go, of course Northern Trackers with an Ally-readying effect could be even sicker."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56222-phase-3-quest-step-1-commit-characters-unexpected-courage/?do=findComment&comment=555416","commentId":555416,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1321180779,"content":"You can play actions during this step, but you cannot double commit characters. You have to commit all characters at once, so even if you did ready a character it would be too late to commit any more characters to the quest.\n\nAlso, like Dam said, you wouldn't gain any extra willpower from this anyway."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56222-phase-3-quest-step-1-commit-characters-unexpected-courage/?do=findComment&comment=555468","commentId":555468,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1321198784,"content":"And once committed, characters remain committed until the end of the Quest Phase unless uncommitted by a card effect (encounter card will say something like, \"Choose a character, that character is no longer committed to the quest but remains exhausted\" or something like that).\n\nSo standing a committed character wouldn't remove them from the quest, they'd still be committed but standing."}]}
