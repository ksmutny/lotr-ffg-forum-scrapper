I said encounter deck).  There are a couple key locations you actually want to keep around.  The Troll Camp is a double-edged sword… it gives all the trolls extra threat in the staging area… BUT also lets Bilbo use resources to discard the \"sacked\" cards the trolls drop on your heros/allies just for engaging.  The other key location is (forget the name) one that recycles the encounter discard pile back into the encounter deck.  Usually not a good thing, but since you have to have the Troll Key objective card on Bilbo in order to travel to the Troll Cave (and have to have the Troll Cave in your victory display to discover the treasures as a win effect), it can be important to get the Troll Key and Troll Purse back into the deck if they somehow end up discarded.\n\nThe second encounter was actually pretty easy as a solo palyer (althouugh I'm sure I had fortunate draws).  It is split into 2 encounter decks.  There are three sites, but the first quest site is purely set up and moves you directly to the second quest site (the Stone Giants) and its deck.  The third site, you discard all previous encounter cards (the stone giant sets) and replace with the second encounter deck (centered around The Great Goblin).  He basically just churns out a Goblin horde to try and overrun you….\n\nI ran with a Elrond, Frodo, and Imrahil deck (I know, I know… horrible for theme - it's what I had built, wanted to just see what it played like).  I am immediately starting work on a Dwarven deck (to redeem my theme-offense) that can run through these!  I enjoyed the uniqueness of the first two encounters.  Look forward to the third!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69834-23-hobbit-quests/?do=findComment&comment=683118","commentId":683118,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1346078895,"content":"cheers for that - i look forward to tackling it myself!\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69834-23-hobbit-quests/?do=findComment&comment=683212","commentId":683212,"userName":"Memetix","timestamp":1346087251,"content":"For Solo play I'd say\n\nQuest 1: DR 6\n\nQuest 2: DR 4\n\nQuest 3: DR 7"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69834-23-hobbit-quests/?do=findComment&comment=684005","commentId":684005,"userName":"Zalrus9","timestamp":1346181588,"content":" Don't know about the first one, but I'd say No. 2 is very hard unless you have a deck that's good in combat or has low threat.
