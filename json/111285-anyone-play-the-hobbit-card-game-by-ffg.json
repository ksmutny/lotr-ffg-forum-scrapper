Suitable for playing with children. \n\nFrom what I can remember it's very simple trick taking mechanics (have to play in suit, highest wins) with a few special cards. It's a team game with the villain team being two players, and the heroes are three players (It works best at 5 and 3 players to maintain this balance - although it has rules for 2 and 4 as well).\n\nI don't remember much about the good team, but for the villians one person is the dragon and gets some extra dragon themed powers. The other villian is an orc warboss. He's quite interesting because his goal is to get the dragon more tricks rather than winning himself.\n\nHowever it's not (for me) very interesting. I would play it with kids, it might be a way to move from regular card games to a bit more meaty games (Introducing special powers and things like that) for adults. \n\nI think anyone that really enjoys the lord of the rings card game will find it very simple and not able to hold your interest for long. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111285-anyone-play-the-hobbit-card-game-by-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=1165621","commentId":1165621,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1406047942,"content":"Just as Rapier said, it's an easy 'regular' card game. Good for parties or family gatherings. It has nothing to do with The Hobbit -- they just tacked on good art to a decent trick taking game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111285-anyone-play-the-hobbit-card-game-by-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=1165867","commentId":1165867,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1406060204,"content":"I own it and agree with Rapier and shipwreck. I got it for my wife for Xmas -- we don't play it much, and if I recall correctly, the balance between two players was not great. It's a very small box and inexpensive game, though, so it's something we consider bringing along for downtime when we go on trips."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111285-anyone-play-the-hobbit-card-game-by-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=1166112","commentId":1166112,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1406071381,"content":"hmm thanks guys. I was hoping for something more and while a fun simple trick taking game can be cool, having a bad 2 player balance and more about group play is probably not going to work for me.\n\n \n\nThanks for giving me your opinions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111285-anyone-play-the-hobbit-card-game-by-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=1170543","commentId":1170543,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1406335019,"content":"Definitely a \"filler\" game. I like it okay, but it is exactly as the others described. A simple trick-taking card game with a vaneer of theme. The team dynamics with different roles for each individual do make it stand out some from other simple card games."}]}
