So for the 14 attachments that we pick that are artifacts or items, they basically all gain the Guarded (location) text to them? We ignore if it says Guarded (enemy) or Guarded (location or enemy)?\n\n3) Does card text still come into play? As an example, if we are able to include Narya, Nenya, and Vilya to our loot deck (Artifact. Ring. traits), do they still have to be played only on their named Heroes? Sting on a Hobbit (Artifact. Item. Weapon. traits)? Etc.\n\n4) \"You cannot include attachments in your deck.\" Can we still start with The One Ring attached to a character since technically it isn't part of the deck? Or would we add The One Ring to the loot deck (Artifact. Ring. Master. traits)? It has a Setup to grab a Master card. Does that mean we can't play the new Inner Strength attachment (Master. trait) with this contract? The Inner Strength attachment card fits the bill of being a Master card that can be selected during Setup.

What we know as attachments in this game were items in MECCG (Minor Items, Major Items, Greater Items, Ring Items, and Special Items). You had to travel to sites (locations) like Carn Dum, Mount Gundabad, Moria, Minas Morgul, etc to play items like Sting (Minor Item), Glamdring (Major Item), Durin's Axe (Major Item), and Orcrist (Greater Item). Traveling to the site meant facing Automatic-attacks (like Orcs - 2 strikes with 8 prowess), but then you could play any item that was playable at that site. \n\n> On 11/14/2019 at 10:46 AM, Halberto said:\n> \n> plus contract are kind of card focus on change how you play the game creating a totally different feeling, play style and deck building approach.

And I think the one ring cannot be part of the 14 set aside attachements. So no possibilities here.\n\nAnyhow, I got somewhat sentimental and built a Caldara (+Arwen +Dain, so a mixture of Dwarf discard and typical Caldara) deck. After playtesting most of the attachements were gone. Only two left (Map of Eardil for late game recursion and Sword Thain to support this). Both can be easily dropped. In that case I'd have a good stating point for this contract. Now I do wonder under which aspects I chose my 14 cards. That deck is not optimized for clearing active locations, so I do see these attachments as add-ons, not as must-haves to run that deck.\n\nI think that all the guarded attachments are somewhat an auto-include, just because they are in general powerfull and their disadvantage (revealing another encounter card) doesn't apply. So, exept Ring Of Thor and Sting I'd take them. As for now this are 6 attachements. 8 more to go. \n\nUnder which aspects you guys do chose your items/artifacts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302153-the-burglars-turn-new-contract/?do=findComment&comment=3927223","commentId":3927223,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1586856500,"content":"> 51 minutes ago, Flrbb said:\n> \n> So, exept Ring Of Thor and Sting I'd take them\n\nIf you have Dain in your deck why no Ring of Thror?Besides being another readying effect its cost can be a bit of an upside in a Caldara deck, depending on the timing.\n\nAnyway it depends a lot if I am playing solo, 2-handed or 4-handed and which heroes are around. There a few Items like Elven Mail, Armor or Erebor and Dunedain Cache which are really useful in big fellowships. But usually the powerful high cost items like Sword That Was Broken (if Aragorn is around), Celebrian's Stone, Herugrim (if there is a good target), Ancestral Armor, Forest Snare, Citadel Plate, Silver Lamp, Silver Circlet, Mirkwood Long-Knife, Raiment of War, Burning Brand might end up in.\n\nEdited April 14 by Alonewolf87"}]}
