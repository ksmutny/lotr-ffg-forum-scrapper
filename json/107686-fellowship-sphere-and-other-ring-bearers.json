The use of language leads me to think that there will be other ring bearers. I know this is old new to most people and I've seen one or two posts in other threads about it but decided to make this anyway.\n\nWho could be other ring bearers? I admittedly haven't ever read the books so I'm not sure who else could be a bearer (I know this is a crime and I plan to remedy this at the end of term).\n\nSam is the only one that comes to mind. Maybe Smeagol?\n\nAgain, I know it's old news for most people but I thought it was something interesting we could chat about. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Let me know what you think."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107686-fellowship-sphere-and-other-ring-bearers/?do=findComment&comment=1104902","commentId":1104902,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1401633909,"content":"Anyone.

Will they open it up for any hero to gain the ring-bearer title or keep it restricted to Frodo and Sam?? I think at first is sounds cool if they scraped the Saga Hero Sphere after this next box and from now only only had a title attachment for a hero to be the ring-bearer, that would make for crazy scenarios and alternate world outcomes. But also that strays so far from the sources I don't know if I would really be comfortable with anyone but Frodo and Sam being the ring-bearer..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107686-fellowship-sphere-and-other-ring-bearers/?do=findComment&comment=1105330","commentId":1105330,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1401662624,"content":"Um.

Only 2 people resisted the ring. Faramir and Frodo, both becuase of love. Sam for Frodo and Faramir for his father. Aragorn, Gandalf, everyone else is consumed, but both of these guys gave it up freely. This is a massive plot point and has implications all the way though the idea of the \"blood of men\" being tainted. Not even Aragorn is immune... there is only 1 human that shows the men can be better than they are, again, as with Sam though Love and Loyalty. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107686-fellowship-sphere-and-other-ring-bearers/?do=findComment&comment=1105845","commentId":1105845,"userName":"ZanzibarLand","timestamp":1401708875,"content":"Interesting. So he isn't a ring bearer in a typical sense, although he did bear and resist its corruption. I don't think he will be a ring bearer card though, the first thing you do to the bearer is give them the one ring.\n\nAfter a little bit of thinking and all your responses, I'm thinking its just worded wonky and we will get a new frodo and nothing else. I'm hoping its an alternative Frodo though, not a replacement like the second Bilbo is. It would be good if he had a different ability that was just as useful so we could choose.\n\nEdited June 2, 2014 by ZanzibarLand"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107686-fellowship-sphere-and-other-ring-bearers/?do=findComment&comment=1105851","commentId":1105851,"userName":"ZanzibarLand","timestamp":1401709205,"content":"> Anyone.

I was not trying to contradict you. Barely adding some references ...\n\n \n\nThe most amazing act of resistance to the One Ring power (except Bombadil) is for me the ability of Bilbo to let go the ring to Frodo almost freely.\n\nWhen we know the power of It and the number of years Bilbo has been exposed to It. It is very impressive to see how Bilbo resisted and succeed in giving It up so fast with Gandalf help.\n\nEdited June 3, 2014 by Courchevel"}]}
