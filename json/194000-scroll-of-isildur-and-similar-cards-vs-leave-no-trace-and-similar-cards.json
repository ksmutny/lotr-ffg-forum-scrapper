Then, place that event on the bottom of your deck.\n\n \n\nThe Situation:\n\nI'm playing a mono-Lore deck. I have a copy of Leave no Trace in my discard pile, having been discarded through a card effect earlier. I also have Scroll of Isildur attached to a hero. A non-unique location leaves play as an explored location, and I discard the attached Scroll of Isildur and pay 1 [Lore] resource to play Leave no Trace as if it were in my hand. As per the text of Leave no Trace, the location and the event card both enter the victory display.\n\n \n\nThe Question:\n\nDo I now place Leave no Trace at the bottom of my deck, as per the text on Scroll of Isildur?\n\n \n\nThe Argument:\n\nYes, because while cards in the victory display are \"out of play\", they are not \"removed from play,\" as per FAQ §1.29 \"Victory display.\"\n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> Cards in the victory display are considered to be out of play, but are not considered to be a part of the encounter discard pile. Cards in the victory display are not considered “removed from game,” and some card effects may still interact with them.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, the section on page 12 of the FAQ about Caradhras (DD 15) sets a precedent for Leave no Trace returning to my deck.\n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> You will remove Caradhras from your victory display and put it back into play as the active location. Cards in the victory display are not removed from the game and can still be referenced by effects.\n\n \n\nAm I missing something, or just crazy?\n\nEdited November 20, 2015 by caelenvasius"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194000-scroll-of-isildur-and-similar-cards-vs-leave-no-trace-and-similar-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1900928","commentId":1900928,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1448015101,"content":"You can't play Leave No Trace using Scroll of Isildur because you don't have an action window and Scroll of Isildur is an Action.\n\n \n\nAssuming you could, I think it is in general a bad idea to use Caradhras as a precedent for interacting with out-of-play cards. The general rule is that a card can't be affected by another card while out of play unless the affecting card specifically says it can. Caradhras is an exception; strictly speaking that quest card should be errata'd."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194000-scroll-of-isildur-and-similar-cards-vs-leave-no-trace-and-similar-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1900930","commentId":1900930,"userName":"caelenvasius","timestamp":1448015527,"content":"You are correct about being unable to trigger the Scroll...Resolve Questing is not a free action step.\n\nDerp."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194000-scroll-of-isildur-and-similar-cards-vs-leave-no-trace-and-similar-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1901293","commentId":1901293,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1448036252,"content":"Even so, you can't use any of the 'scroll' items to use Response events (like the Tactics one with Foe-hammer -- great idea, but doesn't work).  If you have an action window and choose to trigger the Action on the scroll, you have now passed the window of time in which you could have triggered the Response on the event you just dug up.  Using that scroll's action has advanced the game state past the response's trigger."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194000-scroll-of-isildur-and-similar-cards-vs-leave-no-trace-and-similar-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1901368","commentId":1901368,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1448038079,"content":"Until they give us a card with a response that allows us to activate an action as if it were a response... and then the universe collapses..."}]}
