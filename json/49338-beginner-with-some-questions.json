Some Events are Actions (It says at the beginning of the text effect) while others are Responses. If is an action it can be played during those green boxes in the turn flowchart. If it is a response when it can only be played during the time specified on the card (They can even be played during the red boxes).\n\nThey are played directly from your hand when you want their effects. Events never remain in play and are put in your discard when they are played.\n\n \n\nEnemies engaged with you and you can have different attackers and defenders each turn. The hero Dunhere has an ability that allows him to attack enemies in staging (enemies not engaged with any player) and if he attacks an enemy in staging the attack must be alone (the only character attacking that particular enemy) and he gains +1 attack. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49338-beginner-with-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=495131","commentId":495131,"userName":"reno1051","timestamp":1309850518,"content":"thanks for taking the time to clear that up for me"}]}
