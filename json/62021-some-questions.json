Yes, but only if you are defending with the hero to whom Caught in a Web is attached (since Driven by Shadow says, \"Choose and discard 1 attachment from the defending character.\"). Note, though, that if the attack is undefended, you CANNOT discard Caught in a Web, since that part of Driven by Shadow's shadow effect only discards attachments you control.\n\n2. Yes. A location is \"explored\" whenever is has progress tokens on it equal to its quest point value. All relevant responses/effects trigger at that time.\n\n3. Basically, yes. Signs of Gollum can only be claimed at a very specific time. Per p. 5 of the FAQ, players have \"quested successfully\" after staging, as soon as you determine that the total willpower exceeds the threat in the staging area (i.e. before placing progress tokens). At this point--and ONLY this point--you can claim Signs of Gollum if it is unguarded. THEN you place progress tokens. So, in the scenario you presented, you cannot technically \"wait\" to claim the objective until the very moment you finish Stage 2B; however, in the instant that you tally your willpower and recognize you will be placing enough progress to finish the stage, you CAN claim the objective BEFORE placing progress. \n\nThis timing answers the second part of your question. Basically, if the objective becomes unguarded after progress tokens have been placed, you won't be able to claim it until the next turn (since it was guarded at the moment when you \"quested successfully\"). If that were the only Signs of Gollum in play, you would immediately reset the quest deck.\n\nHope that helps happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607654","commentId":607654,"userName":"newdarkages","timestamp":1332194953,"content":"Thank you, and yes, very helpful.  I will try to check out those FAQ's pretty soon, but really quick, here's something that came up last night:\n\nWe were playing Passage Through Mirkwood.  During the Combat phase, Player A destroyed an enemy with Legolas, and per Legolas' Response, 2 progress tokens were placed on Stage 2B.  We drew \"Don't Leave the Path\" for the next quest card, and picked out a Forest Spider and Ungoliant's Spawn, placing them in the staging area.  Player B was playing with Dunhere, who was readied.  Player A was the first player.  Could Dunhere then attack the enemies that were just added to the staging area?  I don't see why not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607659","commentId":607659,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1332196339,"content":"newdarkages said:\n\nThank you, and yes, very helpful.  I will try to check out those FAQ's pretty soon, but really quick, here's something that came up last night:\n\nWe were playing Passage Through Mirkwood.  During the Combat phase, Player A destroyed an enemy with Legolas, and per Legolas' Response, 2 progress tokens were placed on Stage 2B.  We drew \"Don't Leave the Path\" for the next quest card, and picked out a Forest Spider and Ungoliant's Spawn, placing them in the staging area.  Player B was playing with Dunhere, who was readied.  Player A was the first player.  Could Dunhere then attack the enemies that were just added to the staging area?  I don't see why not.\n\n\n\nSure. You flip quest cards immediately after placing the requisite amount of progress tokens on them, even if it happens during the combat phase. When you flip to \"Don't Leave the Path,\" its \"when revealed\" effect triggers immediately. By the time Player B's attack step rolls around, there will be two new targets in the staging area. So, in your example, Player B could indeed attack either spider with Dunhere. In fact, this would work even if Dunhere were under the control of Player A (since Player A can make other attacks besides the one with Legolas). If Dunhere were ready after the sequence of triggers, he could legally attack either spider."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607662","commentId":607662,"userName":"newdarkages","timestamp":1332196989,"content":" Cool, thank you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607727","commentId":607727,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1332218505,"content":"starhawk77 said:\n\n \n\nnewdarkages said:\n\n \n\nI've had this game for two weeks now and am enjoying it very much.  I've got some questions regarding gameplay however:\n\n1.)

Sure, technically it's true that the card text only says that one ttachment from the defending character has to be discarded. However the text in the bracket implies that Driven by Shadow is directed at player controlled cards: \"If this attack is undefended, discard all attachments you control.\"\n\nI don't think that the game designers ever intended to help a player with this shadow effect by making it possible to remove Caught in a Web, but the card reads as if it was possible. I guess there should be an errata for Driven by Shadow that includes the words \"controlled by a player\" in the first sentence."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607733","commentId":607733,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1332219730,"content":"It's a literal reading of the card text. Admittedly, straight interpretations of card wording can be problematic in this game (I'm looking at you, Stand and Fight...), so I can see where you are coming from. But there are other attachment discarding effects that specifically mention player \"control,\" while Driven by Shadow does not. I suppose you could read the second part of the effect as implication that the first part couldn't discard Caught in a Web, but that would be you adding meaning to the text beyond the actual words (again, not necessarily the wrong idea in this game). \n\nIn general, I think it's usually best to abide by the literal wording on the card unless it leads to a blatantly nonsensical outcome. Otherwise, you're trying to read Nate's/Lukas's mind(s). There are plenty of encounter cards that can occasionally prove somewhat beneficial, so I don't think the players managing to acquire some advantage from Driven by Shadow is that far-fetched. Some clarification here would be welcome, but I don't know that Driven by Shadow would receive errata, since FFG has been pretty consistent about specifying control in other instances. Seems to me like the effect would have said, \"Discard one attachment you control from the defending character\" if that had been the intent.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607747","commentId":607747,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1332224434,"content":"1) - No, not in any way is this legal.

I have said many times that as this game is not pvp it is all about player experience.. make up w/e the **** rules you like... Just know there is 2 things happening here.. 1 you are invalidating all your scores, on this quest and most likely others.. and this is one of the reasons we will never see a torny play system and as much as I admire Juice all this stats and scores are meaningless... as everyone is playing incorrectly, due to no one getting check by there assonants in a competitive environment. Still. this is only the most minor of results.\n\nThe real problem here and what i am concerned for you about is that you are failing to understand a basic \"supporting structure\" of the game so to speak. What I mean is that the game has some basic core rules that everything is built off. The reason you can not sack a condition attachment is from one of these core conceptual rules. So you will make similar mistakes all the time for as long as you play. The card text doesn't specify condition attachments as the core rule dictates what cards you can sac already. The attachment type is just a reminder of this....\n\nIt has been said so many time... you can not satisfy the cost of a card or the effect of a card though the payment of a card you do not control. This card is cast on you by the encounter deck, you can not choose to discard it as there is never a choice on your part.. it is not your card to go.. \"yeah I choose that\". As you need to satisfy the cost of the shadow effect from your own card pool.

Driven by Shadow does not require that you control the attachment. Like I have said approximately ten million times now, Nate may issue an errata/ruling that the card functions as you have suggested. But that would be a change or a clarification: the card as written and the body of rules we currently have mean Driven by Shadow CAN discard Caught in a Web.\n\nAs for the argument about paying costs, let's look at the actual rule book text (p. 25):\n\nPaying Costs\nMany cards are written in a “pay or exhaust X to do Y” manner. When confronted with such a construct, everything before the word “to” is considered the cost,\nand everything after the word “to” is considered an effect. Costs can only be payed with cards or resources that a player controls. If an effect is canceled, the cost is still considered to have been paid.reset back into the encounter deck.\n\nIf Driven by Shadow said something like, \"Discard an attachment to cancel this effect,\" that would fall under this section, since that fits the clearly defined formula of paying costs. You could not discard Caught in a Web to pay that cost, since you don't control the treachery attachment (per the FAQ ruling you yourself cited). DbS doesn't say anything of the sort. There is no cost being paid. There is simply an effect. \n\nIn short, I still see no evidence that suggests Caught in a Web is immune. I appreciate your concern for my invalidated scores, but I'll bet on my interpretation of core rules principles and take my chances. \n\nLook, we all know that the wording in this game is often less than ideal. This may be one of those cases where Nate intended for a card to function a certain way, but where the execution of the text muddled the original meaning. That's fine, and I'll acknowledge it if I see proof. Short of that, though, there is no reason to assume DbS works in the way you have posited."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=608194","commentId":608194,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1332294543,"content":"exactly... . you are simply failing to understand some basic core concepts on how the game is played...\n\n7775589.png [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7775589/img/7775589.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=608197","commentId":608197,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1332295306,"content":"So are a lot of other people, apparently.

Some may have some ways out of the effect going through where it is like paying for a cost(place 2 resources on Gollum. A player may pay 1 resource to place only 1 resource on Gollum for example), but they are basically effects that just happen. You are not paying anything to enforce or power them.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nIf this game is a walk to a lemonade stand, you might have some encounters on your way to lemonade stand and back.\nSomeone jumps you and just takes your wallet. This is an example of a Treachery card that just enforces an effect(stealing your wallet).\nAt the lemonade stand you give the vendor 50 cents to take and drink 1 cup of lemonade(let's pretend it gives you +1 willpower). This is an example of paying a cost for an effect. Do X(pay 50 cents) to do Y(take and drink a cup of lemonade).\nOn your way home, you find the person that jumped you and beat them over the head with a broken bottle(exhaust a character for a fun reference) to take back your wallet(take back your attachment from the discard pile). This is an example of paying a cost to take back the attachment.\n\nHope that helps clear it up for you and if not, feel free to comment. :-)\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=608530","commentId":608530,"userName":"guest479094","timestamp":1332344660,"content":"It seems pretty straightforward...\n\nAttachments = anything attached to character.
