Yes, but only if you are defending with the hero to whom Caught in a Web is attached (since Driven by Shadow says, \"Choose and discard 1 attachment from the defending character.\"). Note, though, that if the attack is undefended, you CANNOT discard Caught in a Web, since that part of Driven by Shadow's shadow effect only discards attachments you control.\n\n2. Yes. A location is \"explored\" whenever is has progress tokens on it equal to its quest point value. All relevant responses/effects trigger at that time.\n\n3. Basically, yes. Signs of Gollum can only be claimed at a very specific time. Per p. 5 of the FAQ, players have \"quested successfully\" after staging, as soon as you determine that the total willpower exceeds the threat in the staging area (i.e. before placing progress tokens). At this point--and ONLY this point--you can claim Signs of Gollum if it is unguarded. THEN you place progress tokens. So, in the scenario you presented, you cannot technically \"wait\" to claim the objective until the very moment you finish Stage 2B; however, in the instant that you tally your willpower and recognize you will be placing enough progress to finish the stage, you CAN claim the objective BEFORE placing progress. \n\nThis timing answers the second part of your question. Basically, if the objective becomes unguarded after progress tokens have been placed, you won't be able to claim it until the next turn (since it was guarded at the moment when you \"quested successfully\"). If that were the only Signs of Gollum in play, you would immediately reset the quest deck.\n\nHope that helps happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607654","commentId":607654,"userName":"newdarkages","timestamp":1332194953,"content":"Thank you, and yes, very helpful.  I will try to check out those FAQ's pretty soon, but really quick, here's something that came up last night:\n\nWe were playing Passage Through Mirkwood.  During the Combat phase, Player A destroyed an enemy with Legolas, and per Legolas' Response, 2 progress tokens were placed on Stage 2B.  We drew \"Don't Leave the Path\" for the next quest card, and picked out a Forest Spider and Ungoliant's Spawn, placing them in the staging area.  Player B was playing with Dunhere, who was readied.  Player A was the first player.  Could Dunhere then attack the enemies that were just added to the staging area?  I don't see why not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607659","commentId":607659,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1332196339,"content":"newdarkages said:\n\nThank you, and yes, very helpful.  I will try to check out those FAQ's pretty soon, but really quick, here's something that came up last night:\n\nWe were playing Passage Through Mirkwood.  During the Combat phase, Player A destroyed an enemy with Legolas, and per Legolas' Response, 2 progress tokens were placed on Stage 2B.  We drew \"Don't Leave the Path\" for the next quest card, and picked out a Forest Spider and Ungoliant's Spawn, placing them in the staging area.  Player B was playing with Dunhere, who was readied.  Player A was the first player.  Could Dunhere then attack the enemies that were just added to the staging area?  I don't see why not.\n\n\n\nSure. You flip quest cards immediately after placing the requisite amount of progress tokens on them, even if it happens during the combat phase. When you flip to \"Don't Leave the Path,\" its \"when revealed\" effect triggers immediately. By the time Player B's attack step rolls around, there will be two new targets in the staging area. So, in your example, Player B could indeed attack either spider with Dunhere. In fact, this would work even if Dunhere were under the control of Player A (since Player A can make other attacks besides the one with Legolas). If Dunhere were ready after the sequence of triggers, he could legally attack either spider."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607662","commentId":607662,"userName":"newdarkages","timestamp":1332196989,"content":" Cool, thank you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607727","commentId":607727,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1332218505,"content":"starhawk77 said:\n\n \n\nnewdarkages said:\n\n \n\nI've had this game for two weeks now and am enjoying it very much.  I've got some questions regarding gameplay however:\n\n1.)

Sure, technically it's true that the card text only says that one ttachment from the defending character has to be discarded. However the text in the bracket implies that Driven by Shadow is directed at player controlled cards: \"If this attack is undefended, discard all attachments you control.\"\n\nI don't think that the game designers ever intended to help a player with this shadow effect by making it possible to remove Caught in a Web, but the card reads as if it was possible. I guess there should be an errata for Driven by Shadow that includes the words \"controlled by a player\" in the first sentence."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607733","commentId":607733,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1332219730,"content":"It's a literal reading of the card text. Admittedly, straight interpretations of card wording can be problematic in this game (I'm looking at you, Stand and Fight...), so I can see where you are coming from. But there are other attachment discarding effects that specifically mention player \"control,\" while Driven by Shadow does not. I suppose you could read the second part of the effect as implication that the first part couldn't discard Caught in a Web, but that would be you adding meaning to the text beyond the actual words (again, not necessarily the wrong idea in this game). \n\nIn general, I think it's usually best to abide by the literal wording on the card unless it leads to a blatantly nonsensical outcome. Otherwise, you're trying to read Nate's/Lukas's mind(s). There are plenty of encounter cards that can occasionally prove somewhat beneficial, so I don't think the players managing to acquire some advantage from Driven by Shadow is that far-fetched. Some clarification here would be welcome, but I don't know that Driven by Shadow would receive errata, since FFG has been pretty consistent about specifying control in other instances. Seems to me like the effect would have said, \"Discard one attachment you control from the defending character\" if that had been the intent.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607747","commentId":607747,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1332224434,"content":"1) - No, not in any way is this legal.

Freezing Cold can prevent a character like Glorfindel from becoming committed to a potentially fatal Avalanche!-induced quest to complete Stage 2B of The Redhorn Gate.
