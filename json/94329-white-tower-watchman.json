Or can he only be assigned 3 as that's how many hit points he has, and so I have to assign the remaining 2 attack to one of my heroes?\n\n \n\nI have been playing that I can assign all the damage to him, since the attack is not broken into parts, therefore, he just takes more than he can handle and is destroyed, but my heroes remain unscathed.\n\n \n\nThoughts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94329-white-tower-watchman/?do=findComment&comment=919563","commentId":919563,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1385763372,"content":"i asked this to caleb as a general question and you can indeed assign all damage to the ally. it is not like a cave troll situation\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94329-white-tower-watchman/?do=findComment&comment=919653","commentId":919653,"userName":"kyrie","timestamp":1385774475,"content":"Thanks for the reply! I am glad that's how I have been playing it, then. He really makes an awesome ally in mono-sphere decks. I have been putting him to great use especially in a leadership Gondor deck so that he receives the willpower and attack boost from Visionary Leadership and Leadership Boromir. Truly one of the gems in the AtS cycle, in my opinion."}]}
