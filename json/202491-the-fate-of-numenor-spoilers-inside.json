Hero Gandalf could help to control the top card of your deck.\n\n \n\nHave you tried an outlands deck against the quest? As soon as your oulands have 3 hit points they should be pretty save against the 1 damage to all 2 cost allies card and because you play more or less all your allies as you draw them (combined with hopefully strong card-draw) the discard effects shouldn't matter to much.\n\n \n\nDoesn't the objective ally help controlling your deck's bottom card?

So if you put everything into play as soon as you draw it, the encounter deck actually shouldn't have many threats upon his sleeves.\n\n \n\nIt is obiously a risky idea as you can get completly destroyed in the first two or three turns, as you won't have enough ressources most of the time to pay for everything during that stage of the game, but if you manage to get lucky (or have a test of will) and have your outlands in play the synergy should carry you to victory.\n\n \n\nIf you play Gandalf in your outlands deck, you can actually see the first card of your deck and maybe switch it if necessary, as can the objective ally with the bottom card.

We had about 6-8 Lost Islands in the staging area when we completed the quest. I'll admit the Undead can be a little treacherous in this quest but we were able to get by. The key is to make sure your two cost allies, if they are on the field, have at least 2 hit points. My errand-riders, for instance, were able to soak up some of the damage here and there where other allies like the Silvan might have easily fallen. \n\n \n\nNot sure what the \"code\" might be but a useful tip would be to build a deck with higher cost allies with few low cost cards and some resource acceleration to make up for the build. Or you can have a deck that is capable of a lot of card draw to mitigate all the lost cards. We were hit really badly by the \"discard all cards with an equal or higher cost\" and some extra card drawing pulled us out of that hole.\n\n \n\nGood luck!

Then when this quest hit the table and those Uncharted locations were immune to player card attachments, I had to tip my cap to the designers. We're not on the maps anymore so your Almanac or Thror's Map or such are no longer of any use. Fortunately, The Evening Star could still guide the way even in these Uncharted lands and it helped me avoid further underwater barrows.\n\n \n\nOf course, I have a confession to make that is even more terrifying than the Undead. I used Outlands. It's a shame to admit, but with Elrond, Arwen, and Erestor as heroes, you can really churn them out quickly... Of course, this quest hates on cards that cost two or less, so an early Anfalas Herdsman is essential, but with 20% of your deck in hand during Round 1 (thanks to Erestor), that's not too tough.\n\n \n\nSo far, I've thoroughly enjoyed the sailing and exploring theme and love what they have done with locations in both of the first two quests.

I got lucky and managed to find Shrine of Morgoth on the third attempt. What was really cool was that I faced minimal enemies throughout all of stage 1 (which is super easy by the way.... you are rewarded for exploring locations in so many ways and you can use various treacheries or harmless locations to peek at the bottom side of a copy of lost island in the staging area so I managed to avoid the Drowned Tombs location altogether, got through 2 of the nasty ones that stop characters with less than 2 willpower readying (which were not very harmful and only kept 1 or 2 allies exhausted for a few turns) and then had several copies of the one that draws you a card then lets you put it on the bottom of your deck and 1 copy of the nasty one that takes away ranged and exhausts heroes and whatnot. The turn that last one appeared there were no enemies so exhausting all ready heroes was inconsequential so I was easily able to clear it and stop it from returning to staging. Really clobbered all the late game enemies and slew quite a few undead, I just left the Throngs of Unfaithful alone and never attacked them to avoid their effect upon being destroyed as they only have 2 attack and I had UC on Elrond and sentinel set up on Elrohir so was easily able to defend all attacks (a few copies of Lembas throughout the game were extremely helpful as were 2 copies of feint which were both used on turns I was somewhat swarmed with enemies).\n\nOverall I think I actually enjoyed this quest a lot more and I think the whole uncharted mechanic is so **** good, it actually stops location lock because they all have 2 threat (or 3 when certain treacheries show up) and the amount of locations is fairly static or will only increase by maybe 1 tops 2 due to special effects and any locations not in the uncharted deck are low threat with beneficial results if you explore them. Didn't have Asfaloth (although an early copy of Northern Tracker allowed me to peek at an extra lost island or two over the course of the game) and still managed locations and willpower just fine.\n\nEnemies were fairly tame and very manageable for my decks. Their effects were either avoided due to the nature of my decks or did minimal damage. The Throngs were left in play and not attacked, allies almost never defend in these decks so the Drowned Dead ability never triggered and the biggest foe (forget its name) was almost always pumped to 5 attack but only 1 ever inflicted damage! The final enemy that makes you put cards in your hand under 2 cost on the bottom of your deck was only encountered a few times and did nothing on one occasion (the tactics/leadership deck had all high cost cards and had already used the low cost cards!) and on the other only discard a single copy of Asfaloth as the spirit/lore deck had used up almost all the cards in its hand already.\n\n \n\nGreat quest!

The difference between ‘all’ and ‘each’ is very significant because ‘all’ can include 0 whereas ‘each’ requires there to be at least 1 target. For example, with a When Revealed effect that read: “All engaged enemies make an immediate attack. Then, each player discards the top card of his deck.” the second effect will always trigger, even if there are no enemies in play. But, if that effect read: “Each engaged enemy makes an immediate attack. Then, each player discards the top card of his deck.” the second effect will only trigger if at least 1 enemy made an attack.\n> \n> Cheers,\n> \n> Caleb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202491-the-fate-of-numenor-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2097784","commentId":2097784,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1457795386,"content":"I wish I had the time and energy to do something like http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Project_ANCUR_Wiki [http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Project_ANCUR_Wiki]for this game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202491-the-fate-of-numenor-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2293484","commentId":2293484,"userName":"raven614","timestamp":1467562290,"content":"So how does Aimless Wandering work?
