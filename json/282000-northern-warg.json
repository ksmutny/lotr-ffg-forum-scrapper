Then Johnny defends his enemies' attacks, one of which gets Northern Warg as a shadow card. Northern Warg finishes his attack against Johnny, moves, and attacks Jane. The enemies engaged with Jane have already attacked, so the enemy that moved does not attack a third time.\n\nBut if Johnny is the first player in this scenario, the enemy with Northern Warg as a shadow card would attack Johnny, move, and then attack Jane.

As I understand it the faq does not rule it out.  I mean, enemy attack player 1 and is dealt a shadow card instructing to engage the next player AND make an immediate attack. This overcome the rule clarification listed in the faq. Once all attacks against player 1 are done the phase pass to the next player in turn order.   if the enemy who was passed by the shadow effect is now engaged with a player who have still to resolve enemy attack phase in principle should make a attack. I don't see the faq preventing this as it seems specifically related to attacks make at the moment and in consequence of an enemy being passed by a shadow effect ( so no attack trigger by the new engagement itself useless specifically defined by the shadow effect).

I almost never loose a game with 3 players or more. And I often be disappointed by an interesting challenge at 2 who become too easy at 3.\n\nI think our different could come from the decks we use. If you think about your synergies when you play one deck for balancing the different aspect of the game but take pair random decks when playing at 2 or 3 players it won't work as well. Same thing if you have to split good cards among decks instead of playing them in all of the decks (almost each deck need his own test of will). And some strategies are especially powerful with high player count (like doomed cards Legacy of numenor and deep knowledge). As I often build deck for the whole table I may ensure that it contain synergies but when you meet people and everyone grab a deck he or she want to test it is impossible to do.\n\nThere is, still, some scenario who are more difficult with high player count. Druadan Forest is most easy on solo and became nightmare at 4 (but nightmare version change that and make it an moderate scenario for everyone), and found Attack on Dol Guldur and Battle of Carn Dum are more easy at 2\n\nEdited September 4, 2018 by Rouxxor"}]}
