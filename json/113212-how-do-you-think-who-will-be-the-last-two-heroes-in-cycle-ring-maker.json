For Heirs of Numenor and Against the Shadow, there were two from each sphere (Boromir, Hirluin; Beregond, Theoden; Pippin, Caldara; Mirlonde and Faramir). This wasn't true for Khazad-dûm and Dwarrowdelf, but it was true for Shadows of Mirkwood and Khazad-dûm, which were the first eight heroes after the Core set (Prince Imrahil, Dáin Ironfoot; Brand son of Bain, Boromir; Frodo Baggins, Dwalin; Bilbo Baggins and Bifur). It seems fairly likely that we will have two heroes from each sphere in The Voice of Isengard and the Ring-maker cycle. We've now seen previews for each adventure pack, and we know some information about each hero.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Here are some guesses as to the heroes we'll see, together with some reasons for those guesses. What we know is in bold.\n> \n>  \n> \n> The Voice of Isengard:\n> \n> Eomer. Tactics. Rohan. Noble. Warrior.\n> \n> Grima. Lore. Rohan. Isengard.\n> \n>  \n> \n> The Dunland Trap: Celeborn. Leadership. Silvan. Noble.\n> \n> The Three Trials: Idraen. Spirit. Dúnedain. Ranger.\n> \n> Trouble in Tharbad: Haldir of Lórien. Lore. Silvan. Scout.\n> \n> The Nîn-in-Eilph: Halbarad. Leadership. Dúnedain. Ranger.\n> \n> Celebrimbor's Secret: Galadriel. Spirit. Noldor. Noble.\n> \n> The Antlered Crown: Gamling. Tactics. Rohan.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I'm fairly confident about Idraen. The artist's page [http://jakemurray.deviantart.com/art/Idraen-431989061] describes her as \"a hardened female ranger of the Dunedain.\" It's possible that she's an ally instead of a hero, though we already know that there are three other allies in this pack (Greyflood Wanderer, one Noldor ally and one Silvan ally), together with multiple cards supporting the Silvan trait and Secrecy.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Since many Silvan cards are Lore, I expect that we'll get a Lore Silvan hero that (unlike Mirlonde) synergizes with Celeborn and Galadriel. We also know, from a Master of Lore interview with the artist of Silver Lamp [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/artist-spotlight-owen-william-weber/], that a new card for Haldir is coming. This new card is probably a hero, he's likely Lore, and he's thematically a perfect match for Celeborn and Galadriel. I'm guessing on the scout trait, but it matches Rumil's trait and we know that we'll be getting a unique Title attachment for scouts [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4739] (almost certainly Spirit, which would fit in a Celeborn/Galadriel/Haldir deck).\n> \n>  \n> \n> The last two heroes are more speculative. The designers have been developing Rohan in Spirit and Tactics. I think it unlikely that we'll get three Spirit heroes in the Ring-maker cycle, and especially not two in immediate succession. I'm guessing that the Rohan hero is Gamling from the quote at the beginning of the preview for The Antlered Crown. He's old, and he commanded the defense of Helm's Deep before Théoden arrived. (There are other possibilities, such as Erkenbrand or maybe even a Tactics version of Eowyn.) The Rohan hero could be Leadership, but is more likely Tactics.\n> \n>  \n> \n> The Ranger hero has a good chance of being Leadership, since the Nîn-in-Eilph preview says: \"The Nîn-in-Eilph introduces a new Ranger hero as well as twenty-seven new player cards (three copies each of nine different cards) that focus on knowledgeable guidance and wise leadership.\" If all of my sphere guesses are correct, that would mean two heroes from every sphere. Halbarad is definitely a guess, though there aren't many unused Tolkien characters that would fit the Ranger trait. Dúnedain, Gondor and perhaps Silvan seem the most likely associated traits. Given where the adventure pack is set and the focus on Gondor last cycle, a Dúnedain hero seems more likely than than a Gondor hero. If I'm right that the Ranger hero is Leadership, it seems unlikely that we would get two Leadership Silvan heroes in the same cycle. I doubt we'll see our third version of Aragorn or Faramir here, or another copy of Elladan, Elrohir, Damrod or Anborn. Mablung is a possibility, or perhaps an FFG creation. Assuming Idraen is a hero, I doubt that we would get another Dúnedain FFG creation in the same cycle. It also makes sense to have a Leadership Dúnedain hero aside from Aragorn, since most Dúnedain cards are Leadership.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Speculating is fun, and in less than a month, we'll have some new cards!\n\n \n\n \n\nThe only thing he missed so far was that Haldir has the Ranger trait as well.\n\n \n\nAn artist, I think the same one who did Haldir, also had posted a picture to his portfolio of a Ranger named Mablung so I think that's who the new Ranger hero will be.\n\n \n\nI personally think it's likely the Ranger and Rohan heroes will also have the Scout trait, or at least one of them will. Might just be wishful thinking though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113212-how-do-you-think-who-will-be-the-last-two-heroes-in-cycle-ring-maker/?do=findComment&comment=1197454","commentId":1197454,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1407945940,"content":"> Ranger will probably be Halbarad or Mablung although Halbarad would make more sense for this cycle.\n\nIndeed.\n\nMablung is probably coming, as his art was spoiled a while ago in another thread.\n\nHis sphere is unknown, but I'd guess tactics, as he was no leader.\n\nThat would leave a leadership Rohan hero for ap 6."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113212-how-do-you-think-who-will-be-the-last-two-heroes-in-cycle-ring-maker/?do=findComment&comment=1197562","commentId":1197562,"userName":"13thcaesar","timestamp":1407948898,"content":"We already have three Heroes of Rohan from the sphere of Tactics (Hama, Theoden, Eomer) and only one from the sphere of Leadership (Theodred).
