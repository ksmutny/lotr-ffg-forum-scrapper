(The blue wizards)\n\n \n\nThe blue wizards are not covered by the license FFG has (Middle-earth Enterprises), but are instead held by the Tolkien Estate. A previous game, Middle Earth CCG, managed to get the rights to the blue wizard names by special permission. Anyway, aside from referencing the blue wizards specifically, I think they are pretty free to make up content however they please (I mean, most of the coming cycle is made up, albeit using existing locations)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104131-next-cycle/?do=findComment&comment=1053311","commentId":1053311,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1397778059,"content":"And yet Lotr tcg from Decipher had characters names Alatar and Pallando, though it wans't showing them explicitly, like many other WETA characters."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104131-next-cycle/?do=findComment&comment=1053450","commentId":1053450,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1397792159,"content":"> And yet Lotr tcg from Decipher had characters names Alatar and Pallando, though it wans't showing them explicitly, like many other WETA characters.\n\n \n\nAh, I never played that one so wasn't aware of it. I looked into it and it looks like they tried to get around it by using the moth pictures and implying that the moths were named Alatar and Pallando. I'm no lawyer, but in my opinion, that was a violation of the license, but I guess they got away with it! Not sure if FFG would take the risk or not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104131-next-cycle/?do=findComment&comment=1053489","commentId":1053489,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1397795410,"content":"> > Or they might finally go up north into Belariand (however you spell it.\n> \n> I'm all for this.
