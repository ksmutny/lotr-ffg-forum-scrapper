That has nothing to do with interpretation. Most attachments played on another player´s characters gives you nothing (besides from the hopefully strategic advantage that you are trying to gain).\n\nAnd comparing Song of Earendil with Renewed Friendship isn´t really a valid comparison seing as SoE is an attachment and RF is an event.

Also curious about the main effect of this card. I include it in my deck in multiplayer games, and it has definitely helped my Gondor and Rohan friends who start out with much higher threat than I. (I often play this, take all their threat for a few rounds and then go back down with Loragorn and Galadhrim cards.) But, as I've understood it, you can only absorb 1 threat from each player. Is this true? I suppose the wording \"raise your threat by X to reduce that player's threat by X\" would be too easy to exploit. So, if two friends and I fail at questing and must raise our threat by 3, I can raise by 5 maximum and they by 2 minimum?\n\nEdited October 23, 2013 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92444-who-draws-card-by-earendil/?do=findComment&comment=895010","commentId":895010,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1382535187,"content":"yes- as it is not X, then no matter how large the threat increase on the other player, you can only take 1 off\n\ni use this card with strider to absorb a tactics partner deck's threat increase each round\n\n \n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92444-who-draws-card-by-earendil/?do=findComment&comment=895037","commentId":895037,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1382537872,"content":"Rider of the Mark changes control so the card must specify \"after it changes control.\"\n\n \n\nSong of Earendil never changes control.  You do not control cards in your hand.  And you cannot trigger responses on cards you do not control."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92444-who-draws-card-by-earendil/?do=findComment&comment=895119","commentId":895119,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1382543556,"content":"> Rider of the Mark changes control so the card must specify \"after it changes control.\"\n> \n>  \n> \n> Song of Earendil never changes control.  You do not control cards in your hand.  And you cannot trigger responses on cards you do not control.\n\n \n\nSorry but your wrong about a player not controlling the cards in his hand...\n\n \n\nFrom CoreSet Rules (pag. 25) under tittle Control and Ownership\n\n \n\n \n\"A player “owns” his heroes and the cards that he has chosen for the player deck he is playing. A player “controls” all cards that he owns, unless another player or the encounter deck takes control of the card through a game effect. Any time a card leaves play, it reverts to its owner’s hand, deck, or discard pile (as directed by the effect forcing the card out of play).\n \n(...)\n \nWhen a player plays an attachment card, he has the option of giving control of that card to another player by attaching the card to one of that player’s characters. Players always assume control of attachments that have been played on their characters. If control of that character changes, so does the control of any attachments on that character.\"\n \nBy this rules, i say, again, that, IMO, the sequence is:\n \n1- Choose card to play;\n2- Pay cost;\n3- Card enters play;\n4- Choose wich player gets the control (in attachments);\n5- Attach card to a character (spirit hero in case of SoE)\n \nSo, the player who can trigger the 1st response is the player that plays the card.\n \nBut let's wait for official rulling..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92444-who-draws-card-by-earendil/?do=findComment&comment=895182","commentId":895182,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1382548742,"content":"caleb's ruling (in short it is the player who gets the card, draws the card)\n\nHi Richard,\nA card does not enter play until after its costs have been paid. Once the card enters the game in its appropriate game state, then it has entered play. For example, once you pay the cost for Song of Earendil and you have attached it to a hero, then it has entered play.\nAt that time, the player who controls the hero it is attached to will control the attachment. Therefore, the player who can trigger its response is the player who controls the hero it is attached to.
