First question: you are commiting 3b quest card. It reads:\n\nForced: If there is no progress on this stage at the end of the round, the first player adds the topmost enemy in the discard pile to the staging area, if able.\n\nM1700.png [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Images/Cards/Medium/M1700.png]\n\nThe question is...: the last round you killed one enemy (Bodyguard of Bolg), it had one shadow card dealt. That shadow card was Dark Bats...\n\n \n\nM1677.png [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Images/Cards/Medium/M1677.png]   M1659.png [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Images/Cards/Medium/M1659.png]\n\n \n\nCan you chose which card is discarded first thinking in the forced of 3b (when there is no resources tokens on the quest card, of course)? Or must you discard first enemies and after the shadows?\n\n \n\n2. Second question: for example in 3b also. It has 2 progress tokens at the finish of the round, but there is the location Ruins of Dale, that reads: Forced: Remove 2 progress from stage 3B at the end of each round, if able.\n\n \n\n \n\nM1684.png [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Images/Cards/Medium/M1684.png]\n\n \n\nCan you chose which forced do first? First the 3b and no return any enemy, or first the location and after have to return one enemy?\n\n \n\nThanks for all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93114-the-battle-of-the-5-armies/?do=findComment&comment=903226","commentId":903226,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1383713206,"content":"I am pretty sure that whenever 2 or more cards would be discarded at the same time (e.g., an enemy and its shadow card, or all remaining shadow cards on surviving enemies at the end of the combat phase), you can choose the order in which they are discarded.\n\n \n\nAs for the second question, not sure really.  The way the Forced effect on 3B is worded, it sounds like it will have to trigger.  It sounds like a condition rather than a triggering effect, although a Forced effect is a discrete event that triggers at a specified time...  I would play as if the 3B Forced effect has to trigger, and that the order in which the effects resolve doesn't matter, although I don't have a good argument as to why!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93114-the-battle-of-the-5-armies/?do=findComment&comment=903300","commentId":903300,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1383727443,"content":"Forced effects that share a trigger come into effect at the discretion of the first player.\n\nI would say that you could choose 3b´s forced effect first; it does nothing and then the location removes progress as per it´s forced effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93114-the-battle-of-the-5-armies/?do=findComment&comment=904917","commentId":904917,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1383938159,"content":"> I am pretty sure that whenever 2 or more cards would be discarded at the same time (e.g., an enemy and its shadow card, or all remaining shadow cards on surviving enemies at the end of the combat phase), you can choose the order in which they are discarded.\n> \n>  \n> \n> As for the second question, not sure really.  The way the Forced effect on 3B is worded, it sounds like it will have to trigger.  It sounds like a condition rather than a triggering effect, although a Forced effect is a discrete event that triggers at a specified time...  I would play as if the 3B Forced effect has to trigger, and that the order in which the effects resolve doesn't matter, although I don't have a good argument as to why!\n\nI thing enemy discard first and after discard a shadow card. Since shadow cards cannot be discarded until enemy in play shadow card discard in the end of the combat. Since enemy is dead he go first to discard pile and then shadow card. That how i play it. Sounds logic for me"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93114-the-battle-of-the-5-armies/?do=findComment&comment=904980","commentId":904980,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1383946409,"content":"And...if there are several shadow cards with enemies that are alive, at finish of combat phase, can you discard the shadow cards in the order you want?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93114-the-battle-of-the-5-armies/?do=findComment&comment=905132","commentId":905132,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1383970897,"content":"> And...if there are several shadow cards with enemies that are alive, at finish of combat phase, can you discard the shadow cards in the order you want?\n\n \n\nyep, that much is certain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93114-the-battle-of-the-5-armies/?do=findComment&comment=905997","commentId":905997,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1384159201,"content":"From page 20 of rulebook:\n\n \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShadow Card Leaving Play\n\nShadow cards remain on the enemy to which they were\n\ndealt throughout the combat phase.
