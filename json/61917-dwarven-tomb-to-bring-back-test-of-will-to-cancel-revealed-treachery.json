Test of Will is always useful, and if you are near the end of the Quest, always presume that something bad will happen. In fact, Dwarven Tomb is an awesome card, but if you know you have something great in your discard pile, do not linger too long to get it back, otherwise, well, you know what happens (you need an Action window to play it since it's not a Response)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61917-dwarven-tomb-to-bring-back-test-of-will-to-cancel-revealed-treachery/?do=findComment&comment=606423","commentId":606423,"userName":"Boris_the_Dwarf","timestamp":1331909339,"content":" Events are not instants, like in Magic.

Then you'll be able to play Test of Will (and Dwarven Tomb won't be wasted) as usual. When you draw Necromancer's Reach you can only cancel its effect with a response effect because the effect of the treachery card takes place immediatly after it is drawn. Only a response may stop it, but never an action. That's why you always should read the card text carefully and you should keep in mind if it's an action or a response. Test of Will is a response.\n\n \n\nYou can't bring Gandalf back because he's neutral and does not possess a sphere. I also played it wrong in the beginning as the word \"can\" is implying that the condition is not a must (but it is). Yes, it doesn't makes sense at all.\n\n \n\nETA: ****, should have read the thread a bit further, as this has been already been answered..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61917-dwarven-tomb-to-bring-back-test-of-will-to-cancel-revealed-treachery/?do=findComment&comment=606465","commentId":606465,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1331918656,"content":" Happens to the best of us, friend :-)"}]}
