Their ability: Can spend their resources for any Card with the dwarf trait (or the dwarf keyword in its descriptive text).\n> \n> What do you think?\n\nIn point of fact, there actually were 12 named dwarves that were together for the events depicted in all six quests.  Except for Thorin's capture before \"Spider and Flies\", all thirteen named dwarves were together from the beginning of the book through the Batlle of Five Armies.\n\n \n\nHowever, with Kili, Fili, and Bofur missing from the hero ranks you are three short, two short if you include Thorin.  Of the other existing heroes, Gandalf, Beorn, Bard, and Dain Ironfoot are all named within the text of the Hobbit, though only Gandalf actually participated in a majority of the quests.\n\n \n\nFFG will not release generic heroes, and I for one would grudge the card if they did, since I want named heroes (even if invented) with specific and unique abilites.  I would certainly not object to see Bofur, Kili, and Fili heroes, though only Bofur has a chance.  That leaves you with several options:\n\n \n\n1) Use any hero card you want as the \"generic hero\" you desire.  Since you want a nameless generic dwarf with a generic ability and fixed stats any will do -- or you could just round up three copies of Brok Ironfist and use him as a 2/2/1/4 9-threat generic dwarf.\n\n \n\n2) Use the existing Bofur, Kili, and Fili cards to represent your hero versions of them.  You could choose to \"house rule\" them as 2/2/2/3 heroes, or just treat them as the hero version of their ally cards, though only TaBofur has an ability that would be useful in a hero.\n\n \n\n3) Use dwarves that *could have* participated in the Hobbit.  Gimli was an adult dwarf at the time of the Hobbit and certainly could have gone with his father, Thalin has no backstory, but given dwarvish lifespans (and the known fact that not all of Thorin's company were even of Durin's line), certainly could have gone as well.  Throw in Gimli, Thalin, and Thorin and you have twelve dwarves that *could have* participated in all six quests.  That's as thematic as you are likely to get.\n\n \n\nIf you don't like Gimli because he wasn't on the actual quest, I have bad news for your \"generic dwarf plan\" -- there were no unnamed dwarves on the quest, either.  In fact, these are the only permissible allies for your four dwarf decks in the current pool, if you want to be perfectly thematic:\n\n \n\nAll -- Kili, Fili, Bofur\n\nMust Away -- Gandalf\n\nMisty Mountains -- Elrond (stage one [counsel]), Gandalf\n\nDungeons Deep -- Gandalf, Eagles (stage 3)\n\nSpiders and Flies -- none\n\nLonely Mountain -- none (no Bard ally)\n\nBattle of Five Armies -- dwarves, Silvan elves, Dale/Woodman humans, Eagles, Beorn\n\n \n\nGiven that the dwarvish strategy in the game involves dwarven swarming, I don't think this approach will work very well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233341-we-need-un-unique-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=2475959","commentId":2475959,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1477507469,"content":"Yea, I know.
