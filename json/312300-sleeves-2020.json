I've read good reviews about them (they are apparently cut a little shorter and are more snug than the FFG clear ones were, but some claim that they are an even better fit because of that). "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312300-sleeves-2020/?do=findComment&comment=4010237","commentId":4010237,"userName":"chinviolet","timestamp":1604430248,"content":"Thanks both.  I'll try both I think."}]}
