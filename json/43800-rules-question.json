Can I attach this card only to heroes I control or also to heroes of the other player?\n\nThe same question for the second example. Am I able to play this event card when my partner declares a character as a defender, or only when I declare one of my characters as a defender?\n\nI am not quite sure, but I think I stumbled over a card that was explicitly limited to characters controled by you. That would strengthten my position that cards that are not explicitly limited to your character, can be also played on the characters of the second player.
