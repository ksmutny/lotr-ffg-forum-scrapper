Hopefully it's a lot harder than my previous efforts, which have occasionally been criticised as too easy. I also genuinely wanted to move the difficulty level up towards the level of Escape From Dol Guldur without being as 'impossible'.\n\nFYI - I tried it out originally with a 'Doom Track' of Resource Tokens on the scenario cards which indicated a set number of turns to complete it. But this proved to be either too hard or not relevant enough, and the balance was too difficult to attain. So as long as you're still keeping those Will of the West cards out of your deck you should have fun with it!\n\n \n\nHere it is:\n\n \n\njavascript:void(0);/*1307402358646*/ [http://ratdorg.blogspot.com/2011/06/lord-of-rings-card-game-scenario-5.html] \n\n \n\nEnjoy!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47997-ninjadorgs-scenario-5-ungoliants-lair/?do=findComment&comment=481450","commentId":481450,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1307394778,"content":"I've tried all your other scenarios at least once, with our only fail on The Old Forest, due more to deck choices than scenario strength.
