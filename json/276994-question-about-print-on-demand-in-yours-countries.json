I thought it might be because of the language since the nightmare quests are mostly released in English, but I can't even find them in the UK. It's strange because they have plenty of stock on US stores like miniature market, so I don't get why it's virtually impossible to find them in Europe. I'm tempted to make a massive order on a US store, but then I'd get murdered by custom fees so I'm not sure it's worth it !\n\nDoes anyone know if I'm missing some European website where the first PODs and nightmares are available ?\n\nCheers"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276994-question-about-print-on-demand-in-yours-countries/?do=findComment&comment=3356737","commentId":3356737,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1527844628,"content":"I'm for France too. In French there is only a few POD. Most of the GenCon and fellowship but only cycle 1 and hobbit for nightmare. And since they were released many years ago they are out of stock now.\n\nStores rarely planed to keep a stock for a product. It is not how the business work. They are supposed to buy, sell it quickly and then make another order. And there is many problem about that with the POD:\n\n- The french distributor (Asmodee since they control the whole system now) only sell the french product;\n\n- Many product, but even more for the POD, stay for long in an out of stock process;\n\n- Since they are adressed to a more expert population AND only in english POD are harder to sell than normal products.\n\n \n\nSo here is my advice timpwa if you want to have all: buy the recent stuff when they are online in French stores, try to get the french ones in France too but for the rest don't expect too much and order them in USA. There will be sending fees, and probably custom duties but this is the only way to get them. For the few I have seen UK have less nightmare in store than us.\n\nEdited June 1, 2018 by Rouxxor"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276994-question-about-print-on-demand-in-yours-countries/?do=findComment&comment=3356761","commentId":3356761,"userName":"timpwa","timestamp":1527847029,"content":"Thanks for the advice, I guess I'll have to order them from the US.\n\nDo you have any experience with customs when buying from the US ? I'll at least get the 20% VAT (ouch...), but since buying everything probably costs around 500$, there will probably be other fees from the customs.\n\nWould you recommend buying them little by little instead ? Just curious if you have any feedback in general concerning customs, as these extra fees really weigh into the balance when considering if it's worth it.

France's customs laws may differ a bit, but in Slovakia as an EU country we pay 20% VAT on every order worth more than 20€ and if above 150€, then an additional 3-11% customs tax as well. Check the customs office's rates and you'll see the exact numbers."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276994-question-about-print-on-demand-in-yours-countries/?do=findComment&comment=3359178","commentId":3359178,"userName":"timpwa","timestamp":1528055231,"content":"> 8 hours ago, klaymen_sk said:\n> \n> I'd say little by little.

I had a look and it's similar in France, we don't pay VAT for orders under 45€, so I'll make multiple small orders from the US\n\n "}]}
