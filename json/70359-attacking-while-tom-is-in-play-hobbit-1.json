The rules on page 20 state the player can only attack an enemy one time ( I know you can attack with more than one character at this time) but my question is with Toms text does that mean that the Trolls  can be only be attacked by only one character but  also then not attacked again that combat phase? Also I'm playing that if any troll dies its' printed constant ability it has is gone also."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70359-attacking-while-tom-is-in-play-hobbit-1/?do=findComment&comment=686741","commentId":686741,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1346629083,"content":"Correct on both counts.\n\nGenerally speaking, players may only attack a given enemy once per combat phase. While Tom is in play, you may only declare one character as an attacker vs. Troll enemies. So, during each combat phase, you get at most one attack with one character against each troll. As soon as Tom (or, for that matter, either of the other trolls) leaves play, his passive ability is no longer in effect.\n\nIn most cases, this makes Tom, Bert, and William very tough to kill. However, characters like Gimli and Erebor Battle Master make good solutions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70359-attacking-while-tom-is-in-play-hobbit-1/?do=findComment&comment=687734","commentId":687734,"userName":"raven614","timestamp":1346777772,"content":" Thanks for the reply. I have been playing that wrong. I just reread that rule I spoke of and thought I would run it past you guys.I was only attacking one character at a time but multiple times thanks for clearing that up.\n\nLove the game this is my first card game and I'm learning a lot from the forums. I don't think I would have started playing if not for the forums and the passion that other display when writing here. I haven't won this quest yet but am still trying. It dosn't bother me that I lose a lot, its a lot of fun thinking about how to adjust and put together another team."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70359-attacking-while-tom-is-in-play-hobbit-1/?do=findComment&comment=687753","commentId":687753,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1346779249,"content":"raven614 said:\n\n Thanks for the reply.
