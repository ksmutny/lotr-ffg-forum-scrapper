I've always enjoyed playing secrecy decks but have never really been able to get them to ring. Recently it seems there has been some decent secrecy support so I've started experimenting again.\n\nI'm finding that ironically, it seems to have become more viable as a cooperative play deck. I can usually get a pretty good resource curve going, quest pretty well, and find that Merry (who I thought woukd be the key) is much more potent and consistent at reducing threat in multi.\n\nI am struggling with secrecy decks in solo, primarily because I can't seem to find a good way to deal with enemies, and Merry's threat reduction is shakier and more costly (exhausting a hero is steep price in solo.\n\nAnybody else been experimenting with secrecy?

Secrecy is not supposed to be found in every card of the deck.

I mean, most of the secrecy cards are playable, but it's only a handful that are essential to this deck. Timely Aid and Resourceful are cards the deck depends on to be successful, while the other secrecy cards you don't really need them. The 1 cost events and most of the other secrecy cards are cool and useful, but they're not essential (except for Noiseless Movements in a secrecy Haldir deck). I do think the deck would benefit from Ithilien Lookout though, as he is an extremely good card in secrecy. But as I said, in this specific deck, as well as most secrecy decks, you only need a couple secrecy cards, the rest of the slots being used for must-have cards every other deck uses. For the Secrecy Dunhere deck you need Resourceful and a couple other Spirit secrecy cards (Out of Sight works great for those enemies that do get through), but you don't need to fill the deck with secrecy cards. In fact, in this deck you only need secrecy for the first couple of turns; after you've set up you don't care if your threat is above 20."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1849028","commentId":1849028,"userName":"Denison","timestamp":1444873338,"content":"I have so many high cost allies in my version of this deck (Sam/Merry/Pippen) that I threw in Taking Initiative.  38 of the cards trigger it in round 1.

I'm gonna try pure green damrod and mirlonde soon, too.\n\nEdited October 16, 2015 by camacazio"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1853751","commentId":1853751,"userName":"mjd83","timestamp":1445185416,"content":"Thanks to the outstanding community here contributing advice, I think I finally crafted a solo secrecy deck that is both potent and thematically satisfying.\n\nI decided to go with the Haldir angle. Yes, I unfortunately do need Glorfindel, but by making it an all elven secrecy deck, he goes from being a crutch to a thematic inclusion.\n\nI decided to drop out Merry and get access to tactics through one of my oft overlooked and forgotten all time favorites, my old friend the Rivendell minstrel. The other cool part about this decision is the replacement with Mirlonde allows me to play on the rivendell/lorien theme. There is not a single non thematic card in this deck, as I've purposely left out power includes like quick beam because I can't stand the thought of ents in Moria and frankly don't think I need him. This deck is all about fixing enemies in the staging area and destroying them with Haldir while questing with strong wp ally support.\n\nThe other nice thing is that about a third of the deck is either secrecy or secrecy related cards, so it actually feels like a secrecy deck and not just a dash of secrecy thrown in. I think I've covered all of my bases except the use Glorfindel, and I've even found a way to minimize the pain of using him by making him thematic. This was all based on the suggestions people made on this thread so Thanks!\n\nTime to go up against my favorite deck tester (and some of my favorite quests to date BTW), the nightmare Khazad Dum quests.\n\nI'm sure there will be some fine tuning, but I'll report back how my secrecy experimenting is going."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1855367","commentId":1855367,"userName":"UK1968","timestamp":1445280488,"content":"Hi you all.I'm a long time player of meccg but i play this game right from the start.I got every expensions up to date and waiting for The Land of Shadows now.This is my first post but a long time follower of this Forum.I only play Dwarf/Hobbit decks because i don't get much time to build new decks so i stick to 2 decks and modify them.So@Duke:Could you please post the decklist of that Dwarf/secrecy deck?With Hobbits secrecy is logic but Dwarves sounds too cool."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1856311","commentId":1856311,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1445325577,"content":"Dwarf Secrecy [http://ddddirk.github.io/lotrdb/#/%23NoIgIg7ghgTgZgAgMoFMDGN0E8QBpRR4DMuAjALr4iG4AsZloARnvRVTQGwNUu7ftgJAOwBOHsGH9cRRiD4AOCdTxTBAJlzjZvVRIAMuAKzj1jTaVIzGhzlbNUUrCSQGMjZWlZ3BDwkj4kpPrcDr78hoJWwdb4mkGMrvGJ-N42dNyBMsn4Qeqm6bQF5EA]\n\nTotal Cards: 50\n\nHeroes (starting threat: 25)\n\nNori [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Nori-thohauh] (Over Hill and Under Hill)\n\nOin [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Oin-thotd] (On the Doorstep)\n\nOri [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Ori-thohauh] (Over Hill and Under Hill)\n\nAllies (30)\n\n1x Fili [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Fili-thohauh] (Over Hill and Under Hill)\n\n1x Gimli [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Gimli-tos] (The Treason of Saruman)\n\n1x Glóin [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Gloin-thotd] (On the Doorstep)\n\n1x Erebor Battle Master [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Erebor-Battle-Master-tld] (The Long Dark)\n\n3x Blue Mountain Trader [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Blue-Mountain-Trader-tdt] (The Dunland Trap)\n\n1x Bofur [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Bofur-trg] (The Redhorn Gate)\n\n1x Dwalin [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Dwalin-thotd] (On the Doorstep)\n\n2x Imladris Stargazer [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Imladris-Stargazer-fos] (Foundations of Stone)\n\n1x Kili [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Kili-thohauh] (Over Hill and Under Hill)\n\n3x Zigil Miner [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Zigil-Miner-kd] (Khazad-Dûm)\n\n1x Bifur [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Bifur-thotd] (On the Doorstep)\n\n2x Erebor Hammersmith [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Erebor-Hammersmith-core] (Core Set) 3x Erebor Record Keeper [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Erebor-Record-Keeper-kd] (Khazad-Dûm)\n\n3x Ered Nimrais Prospector [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Ered-Nimrais-Prospector-tmv] (The Morgul Vale)\n\n1x Henamarth Riversong [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Henamarth-Riversong-core] (Core Set) 2x Miner of the Iron Hills [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Miner-of-the-Iron-Hills-core] (Core Set)\n\n3x Gandalf [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Gandalf-core] (Core Set)\n\nAttachments (10)\n\n1x Narvi's Belt [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Narvis-Belt-kd] (Khazad-Dûm)\n\n3x Legacy of Durin [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Legacy-of-Durin-twitw] (The Watcher in the Water)\n\n3x Resourceful [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Resourceful-twitw] (The Watcher in the Water)\n\n3x Song of Kings [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Song-of-Kings-thfg] (The Hunt for Gollum)\n\nEvents (10)\n\n2x We Are Not Idle [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/We-Are-Not-Idle-saf] (Shadow and Flame)\n\n3x Hail of Stones [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Hail-of-Stones-rtr] (Road to Rivendell)\n\n3x The Galadhrim's Greeting [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/The-Galadhrims-Greeting-core] (Core Set)\n\n2x Will of the West [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Will-of-the-West-core] (Core Set)\n\nEdited October 20, 2015 by DukeWellington"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1856323","commentId":1856323,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1445326716,"content":"I have made a dozen version s of the deck, but that is one. I call it a secrecy deck, but really Resourceful is the only secrecy card. The deck is really about drawing crazy cards off LoD and Ori, then playing lots of dwarves to drop below 20, using we are not idle, zigil miner, and resourceful to generate resoures. You want to chump block and use WotW to recycle and repeat. Once you are rolling, hail of stones is amazing, killing enemies in staging area and erebor battle master finishes off bosses. The deck is slow, but has a very high potential.

It has a starting threat of 26, but it's easy to get it below 20. Decksize is at 64 atm, but with 3 card draws each turn (as a solo player) that really doesn't matter. Galadriel's Mirror could give you even another card draw. I'm posting the deck once I have it optimized. So far it includes 13 secrecy cards, but I'm probably going to increase the deck size for some more."}]}
