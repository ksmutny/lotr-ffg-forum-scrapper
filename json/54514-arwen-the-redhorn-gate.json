It's a good thing, with these numbers you know when you're missing an encounter card. Especially if you don't know the number of copies of a single card.

If the new number wouldn't be increased with every copy of a card, it would just be the old number, only shifted by an offset (here 13), and not very much useful... And 29 is also roughly the numbers of the encounter cards in previous AP (29 in HfG, 30 in CatC, 29 in AJtR, if I didn't make a mistake).\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54514-arwen-the-redhorn-gate/?do=findComment&comment=539966","commentId":539966,"userName":"Vyron2","timestamp":1318266528,"content":" I just wanna say - returning back to the thread's eponym - Arwen is beautiful... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] also in the movies...
