Thank you Nate! Anyway, those were 3 topics that were not clear to me and I think that some people may find the below useful.\n\n \n\n1. In Hills Of Emyn Muil quest, treacheries can gain extra surge effect if there are no locations in play. What if I draw a treachery like impassable chasm which has its own surge effect? Does surge stack so I have to resolve 2x surge and draw 2 more cards from encounter deck? I suspect that this may be a case because as per FAQ, some effects like Caught in the web are stackable (and this situation looks similar to me). Can you please confirm?\n\nResponse (quote)\n\nYes,\n\nIf a card has multiple instances of the surge keyword, each instance should be resolved.\n\n \n\n2. The impassable bog reads: when revelead, add 1 token to gollum for every location in the staging area. When this text is triggered, is the just-revealed Bog considered in the staging area? In other words, does the Bog count itself as a location in the staging area?\n\nResponse (quote)\n\nEncounter cards are revealed from the encounter deck, their \"When Revealed\" effects are resolved, and the card is then placed in the staging area. So the Bog has not yet entered the staging area when its effects resolve.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Is active location considered in the staging area?\n\nResponse (quote)\n\nAn active location is not considered in the staging area.\n \n\nEdit: I asked question number 3 because in Khazad Dum there are some location that grant +1 attack to all enemies when the location is in the staging area. I was not sure if this effect still works after we travel to such location.\n\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58753-3-questions-to-ffg-and-official-responses/?do=findComment&comment=577441","commentId":577441,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1326194359,"content":"I played #2 wrong when I played Dead Marshes, but didn't change the results, still won all my games."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58753-3-questions-to-ffg-and-official-responses/?do=findComment&comment=577772","commentId":577772,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1326235671,"content":" Thanks for getting some answers for us!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58753-3-questions-to-ffg-and-official-responses/?do=findComment&comment=577841","commentId":577841,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1326251869,"content":"Yep, thanks for getting those answers!\n\nParticularly #1 is utterly surprising to me.

As in if you run 3 cards, can you use that ability 3 times, one for each card.\n\nAlso, if 2 players use Landroval, then can both players can activate their Landroval cards separately? I know you can only have 1 on the table at a time, but dose the \"once per game\" thing cover ALL players or only the player that controls the card.\n\nLastly, we know that going into your hand dose not reset the \"once per game\" rule, but dose playing the card form your gravyard also not reset the ability?\n\nThanks as always for giving us a defiant answer.\n\n \n\nA - Limits are player specific, each player can reach the limit.\n\n\"Per game\" limits are not card specific, they refer to any copy of the effect under that player's control.

Frodo is useless in this situation or i get it wrong???\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nyea this is how I read it as well..\n\n\n\nThis is correct. If you assign excess damage to Frodo, you do so one point at a time. His ability will only be able to cancel one point of damage in this scenario.\n\nIf, however, you defend against the troll with Frodo, he can cancel all damage he would receive from the troll's attack (4, barring other card effects). \n\nSo, Frodo is not very useful to soak up overkill damage, but he is exceptional as the actual defender."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58753-3-questions-to-ffg-and-official-responses/?do=findComment&comment=586412","commentId":586412,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1327795497,"content":"Yeah.. obvious.. but probably needed to be said :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI wonder if this will finally be able to convince people that Frodo is one of the best Plate and Warning targets in the game?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58753-3-questions-to-ffg-and-official-responses/?do=findComment&comment=590508","commentId":590508,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1328530296,"content":"Question\nThere is a number of effects that say \"Search the Encounter Deck and the Discard Pile for x\" Dose this command imply a order.. as in search the encounter deck 1st, then the discard pile or dose it mean you can simply choose witch one you want to search in?
