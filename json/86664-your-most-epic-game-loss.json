The first time I played it, the first round of facing Smaug, he attacked 7 times in a row and killed all of my heroes. The best part is, I had an awesome draw and was totally thinking I had the scenario in the bag. I was so mad that I kept drawing through the deck, just to see how many more attacks he would have made. Of the top 10 cards on the encounter deck, I think 9 of them had burgle effects. That scenario is kinda ridiculous. Lately, I've been sadistic enough to attempt Escape from Dol Guldur Nightmare solo. Typically one or two rounds in, it is obvious that I have lost the game, in some case horribly. It is a welcome change after stomping some of the Against the Shadows scenarios."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86664-your-most-epic-game-loss/?do=findComment&comment=825696","commentId":825696,"userName":"Shtanky","timestamp":1375117595,"content":"Shadow and Flame\n\n \n\nWe had what we thought were fantastic draws to be ready for the turn 2 assault, but the first Shadow card was \"Doomed 1\", so out came Mr Happypants, which wouldn't have even killed anything, but the 2nd Shadow card was his +3 Attack Sword. \n\n \n\nTurn 1 slaughter. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86664-your-most-epic-game-loss/?do=findComment&comment=826040","commentId":826040,"userName":"Crabble","timestamp":1375137704,"content":"Solo Road to Rivendell, turn 4 or 5.
