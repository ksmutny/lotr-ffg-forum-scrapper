Is it really fair to raise other players threats with the cards you play? It seems to fly in the face of the spirit of a cooperative game to me. I won't lie - I fear getting slapped in the face when I tell my wife to raise her threat by 2 and draw 2 cards, lol.\n\nI love the cards for solo play, for the most part. The spirit card is very situational, but otherwise.\n\nI'm curious what others' experiences have been with this cycle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100546-doomed-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1002666","commentId":1002666,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1393962443,"content":"I think it's \"fair,\" but sometimes it doesn't really work out in your favor. For example, I don't think I will ever use Saruman if I'm playing two handed, as I know my combat deck can't handle that kind of threat increase. I think some of the cards are worth it, like the card draw for 2 or the condition removal for 2, but even then it hurts. The cards do what I think they were very much intended to: be very useful, cheap, but come with a different cost. But I second what you say, solo these would be easier to swallow, doomed being universal really hurts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100546-doomed-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1002674","commentId":1002674,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1393962884,"content":"I only play solo, but for cooperative it really must be something that everyone gamed for.  If all the decks in play aren't ready for the doomed effects then I can totally see someone getting blindsided.\n\n \n\nBut as a solo player I love the Spirit card the best.  Conditional attachment removal at event speed.  Woohoo!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100546-doomed-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1002760","commentId":1002760,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1393966271,"content":"Bring the Loragorn with the Desperate Alliance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100546-doomed-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1002889","commentId":1002889,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1393972609,"content":"This is a good opportunity to remember that rules are important, but you are playing the game with actual people.  Doomed cards are mostly made to help the whole group so far (Grima and that deck search card are exceptions), but definitely this is a time where you should be saying \"How do you feel about raising your threat right now?\" if you are acting as part of a team."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100546-doomed-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1002895","commentId":1002895,"userName":"chrsjxn","timestamp":1393972852,"content":"All of the doomed cards currently benefit everyone.
