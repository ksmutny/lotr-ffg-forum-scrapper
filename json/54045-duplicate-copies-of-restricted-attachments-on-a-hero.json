Restricted attachments says only two can be attached on a hero/character.  No hero should have two Citadel Plates (restricted item) attachments on him (and get +8 hitpoints).   Same thing with 2 Blades of Gondolin or 2 Dwarven Axes on 1 hero (though possible with 2 hands, Blades' response triggers of putting progress token also duplicated w/c is kind of weird)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54045-duplicate-copies-of-restricted-attachments-on-a-hero/?do=findComment&comment=535730","commentId":535730,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1317515550,"content":"If your issue is with the fact that it doesn't make sense to be wearing 2 sets of armor or something, then I believe it even says in the rulebook something along the lines of thinking of it as having 1 set of improved armor rather than 2 different sets.\n\nOtherwise, they can simply make an attachment unique if they don't want multiple copies in play."}]}
