If you push a card into the staging area, then it dose not attack.

Like Dark Knowledge.. sure you can use it.. but dose anyone use it? Ziggy has been so baldly stuffed that it is now a completely irrelevant card that no one will ever use. They had a ton of options… even a strait up banning would have been better than what they did. They still haven't made a \"restricted\" list so they could have started there, they could have made it a single copy a deck, they could have made him unique so only one goes on the table. They could have done a lot of things to \"fix\" this card..\n\nThink about what this card dose now.. it discards 2 cards to gain at the most 2 resources, and in all truth most likely you will only ever be pulling 1. With SoG, Resourceful, the other resource engines and not even counting the Hero and Song splash cards.. why would ANYONE ever play this card now.. 1 resource is just no worth it. It has discard sure, but when you stack that vs the new \"draw a card\" leadership guy or the 2 discard to block / attack allies… well again.. if your looking for a discard effect… there are better options.\n\nZiggy wasn't fixed… he was simple made unplayable.. they ****** up twice with this guy…  really terrible."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68354-new-faq-13-pro-glaurung/?do=findComment&comment=666757","commentId":666757,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1343770965,"content":"The Janitor said:\n\nTwo unneeded errata, and Zigil Miner getting hit way harder then it had to.

Now Zigil is more like Horn of Gondor: a nice addition, but not as good as the card of the sphere which focuses on that theme.

ANY card can be played as a body to be used as a blocker or a small quester.. Keen Eyed Took for example.. can be played like this.. BUT it is the card ability that makes it unique and decides if a card has value to a deck construction idea. We are talking about his ability not his function as a blocker or an ally as this hasn't been changed at all. You could compleatly blank his text box and what you are saying would still be true.

I never got UC out, so Beravor only ever used her ability once per round anyway. I got Zigil Miner out on the very last round but had Steward of Gondor anyway so didn't need Zigil Miner's resources.
