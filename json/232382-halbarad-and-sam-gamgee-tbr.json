(Assuming you don't use an effect that causes him to exhaust in between engaging the first and second enemy.)\n\n \n\n2) For the Halbarad ally from Flame of the West: If I engage an enemy with engagement cost that is 5 lower than my threat, does Sam Gamgee's effect still trigger given that Halbarad increases the engagement cost of all enemies engaged with you by 10, thus putting the engagement cost of the enemy you just engaged at 5 higher than your threat? Or does Halbarad's effect only start applying after the window in which Sam Gamgee's effect can be triggered has already closed?\n\n \n\nThanks for any insights!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232382-halbarad-and-sam-gamgee-tbr/?do=findComment&comment=2457114","commentId":2457114,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1476462828,"content":"1.
