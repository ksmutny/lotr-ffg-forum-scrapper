When making a post, all the buttons along the top have Spanish labels etc, which I thought was exotic at the time, and managed to guess my way into making a post, but just made a post in the \"game night kits\" thread only for it to just not work (it was a wonderful post, too - a loss to mankind, I dare say).

To tell the truth if not for all of you I would be gone already. I am also disappointed with FFG's lack of news and statement or even response to my e-mail about this problem. Since their participation in this forum is zero as far as can tell I do not see much advantage of using it.  \n \nDon't get me wrong I still like the company and their products but my rating of their customer/community support dropped down quite a few notches. \n \nAs for problems:\nI have Spanish descriptions of all the icons in the edit window - it loads slowly but works.

I live in Norway and have experienced the same things. Think it might have something to do with FFG updating the forum. Maybe with stuff only a specific version of java can run or something like that. And depending on who gets the updates at what time it'll start working again maybe.

I tried it four times consecutively, and got all sorts of weird and wonderful mishaps. I checked the Warhammer forum, it was fine, I came back here, and just had a blank grey page.
