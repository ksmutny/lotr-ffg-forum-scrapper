Am I right in assuming that if I just clear the 2 cards, that I've won the game? Just because there is now XXXXX players win the game, as was in every core set quest and HfG...\n\n \n\nthanks a lot, see you guys around "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52755-conflict-at-the-carrock-only-two-stage-cards-victory-condition/?do=findComment&comment=524724","commentId":524724,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1315303606,"content":"Correct.

I kill all the trolls but have 1 Brown land as active location and another on the staging area. Zero tokens on quest. And cards is coming and comings all locations. My threat level was really high!!! I cwnnot get trough locations and start ti give up tnen tracker come and change everything. I finish with 2 cards left in Encounter deck: 2 sucked cards. Lucky!!!\n\nCarrock actually is really tricky specially when you play Coop games. You feel like everything is under control then boom and your threat level is go up and 4 nasty trolls engage you. If they coming all 4 most of the time is the end. When you start to get 3 threat after each troll attack you doomed.\n\nBut if you can manage trolls  1 by 1 is can be really boring sometimes........"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52755-conflict-at-the-carrock-only-two-stage-cards-victory-condition/?do=findComment&comment=527420","commentId":527420,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1315890536,"content":" Finally got Conflict at the Carrock yesterday.  Great scenario.  Managed to see off those Trolls with my Lore/Spirit deck.  I had Dunhere with three Marks of the Dunedain, plus Berevor with Steward of Gondor and 2 Unexpected Courage, Denethor with a Burning Brand.  With Grimbeorn added to my many allies those Trolls had no chance!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52755-conflict-at-the-carrock-only-two-stage-cards-victory-condition/?do=findComment&comment=527421","commentId":527421,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1315890798,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nCarrock actually is really tricky specially when you play Coop games.

He killed both of his trolls that same turn they engaged (angry Gimli, angry Beorn and Grimbeorn among his characters), while I threw two Snowborn Scout to mine, Forest Snared one, then grind them out over the following turn. All we had in terms of threat reduction was 2x Gandalf for me and he used 1x Gandalf, 1x Greeting."}]}
