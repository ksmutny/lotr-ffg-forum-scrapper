According to FAQ 1.1 should be quite hard.\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease,  post the deck that beat Osgiliath 90% of the time!\n\n\n\nOk i donth have a deck list with me but i can explain how its works. There is 2 decks.\n\n1. is  Beravur, Eowyn, Eleanor. Purpose of this deck is Cancel revealed effect and draw card and support whit some cool atachments as well. Like : Burning Brand and so on. There is lot of allies in this deck: River song(very important to know shadow card of the first enemy) Nimrodel , Miner and so on.\n\nThis deck usually not engage the enemies and dont fight much.\n\n 2. Second deck is Gimly, Theodred, Thalin. This is fighting deck. There is many eagles as well. Dunedian warning, marks and all this stuff include sneak attack and Gandalf of course. + feint , first strike and all cards for fighting. This deck take all enemies on him and kill them.\n\nSteward included in this deck you play on Eowyn first deck never on this deck heroes. And anohter deck play song of wisdom on Thalin and after  B Brand on him to cancel all shadow effect.\n\nThe most problem is survive first 3 rounds. If you survive the heroes start to get attachments and events (By Beravur) they already strong enough to kill most of the enemies.  Now you need Ranger of Ithilien. In 2 player game you get it for sure. Dont rush to much and try to play as much allies as you can+ Faramir.Then you cross the river.\n\nNow time for  Faramir job. First deck have a lot of allies and second deck have some too. On the last stage you dont care about Witch-King you just engage him play feint or some ally can die add 3 threat and next turn you quests with all allies + Faramir can be around 40-50 will power.\n\nFinish you win.Is more easy then you can think sometimes.\n\nI will post the decks list later.\n\nOf course in solo game is not so easy but this 2 decks works perfect against any quest for now. That why we decide to play  nightmare from now.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54872-new-card-in-dead-marshes-useless-for-solo-players/?do=findComment&comment=543585","commentId":543585,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1318916433,"content":" Yeah Richsabre, I can see where you're coming from as I am also a solo player primarily.

We have 2 very good working together decks. Quest/draw/cancel effect deck Beravur/Eowyn/Eleanor  and fighting deck Gimly/Theodred/Thalin.\n\nIn this thread before i use to explain how those 2 decks very good work together against any quest even against Osgiliath so here is my report about how is work in Nightmare.\n\nFirst,  big surprise for us nightmare with even new FAQ 1.1 rules is more easy and annoy then just solo game. Why???? Cose in this game you can control what kind of cards you have in your deck on the beginnig of every quest session. For example:  In the first game by Beravur we both take all our deck in hands. Than When you come to the last stage of the quest you heal all your wounds, reduce your threat and discard to discard pile all the cards(by Protector of Lorien) which you dont need in the next Quest (in our case next one is Carrock). So then when you finish the first quest you start second one with the best cards in  you draw deck. you can even discard all the cards keep only 7 and exactly manage your best starting hands!!! And Beravur deck get in starting hand dwarven tomb and Will of the west so you always can get your deck back from discard pike later for both players when you need it. So you can Choose your staring hand from quest to quest easy!!!!! This is amazing!!!! This advantage you can never get in normal game. So i dont tnink need to explain the encounter deck cannot do nothing against you. So you can manage your staring hand, You always have resources to pay for your cards(steward) you always have enough cards in both players hands so you can answer on any card in encounter deck and you always have advantage cose  encouner deck still reveal only 2 cards per turn.\n\nPoor baby encounter deck!!!! I feel pity for him!!!! Ohh my god!!!! This is what  Nate French develop for this game?????Sorry but something wrong here.\n\nI hope my english is good enough and every one undestand what i mean and you can always try this by yourself!!!!

I have a Lore/Spirit deck with Beravor, Unexpected courage, Ancient Mathom and Ereborn Hammersmith to get those back. Even with only one Unexpected Courage on Beravor you draw roughly 6 cards in average per turn (including Ancient Mathom etc) even more if you have two Courages on her. Then you blast your way through the quests with Protector of Lorien. Its very efficient but not very entertaining.\n\nIn a nutshell: If you wanna draw your whole deck its pretty well doable with the current card pool"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54872-new-card-in-dead-marshes-useless-for-solo-players/?do=findComment&comment=546023","commentId":546023,"userName":"Untergeher","timestamp":1319354276,"content":"@Glaurung: Congratulations, you broke the game.

Beravor + multiple Courage is a nice combo, but does not break the game, it makes you win more and the victory is more overwhelming. Drawing 5 cards per turn does NOT win you the game.\n\nThe thing that counts is the victory and not \"the style\". If the deck focuses too much resources on card drawing, it may lose the game while the board is not stabilized yet. If the board is no more threatening to you, you may pull off a combo like \"draw entire deck\", but the point is, drawing entire deck did not help you at all, you already won the game before you started putting 2nd and 3rd courage on beravor. When the encounter deck is not capable of doing anything against you, it does not matter AT ALL if you draw 1, 3 or 100 cards per turn.\n\nThere is only one main reason to put courage on beravor that really helps the player. It is to make her useful in questing/attacking//defending (while still drawing 2 extra cards per turn).\n\nSo to summarize (if you have beravor + multiple UC) , drawing entire deck does not make you win the game. Instead, winning a game makes you draw entire deck.

He is ranged and there is some flying enemies already + his will power 2 quite cool for tactic hero and attact Defense , hit points + threat cost is quite good.

Absolutely correct. If you're playing to win, you'll exploit every loophole in the rules (or bugs if you're into competitive video games). It's not about fun, it's about winning consistently.\n\nCheck out Sirlin's homepage to get an idea about the mind of a pro player:\n\nwww.sirlin.net/ptw [http://www.sirlin.net/ptw]\n\nEven after over ten years it's still extremely relevant and explains quite well why pro players (like Glaurung) often make such a obnoxious impression to non-competitive or casual players."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54872-new-card-in-dead-marshes-useless-for-solo-players/?do=findComment&comment=546926","commentId":546926,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1319514640,"content":"A great read.
