Any game, not just LOTR LCG.\n\nEveryone knows that those are just games and most of this stuff is irrelevant (because games are for fun). You just play and don't analyze the world. But some people are very selective and they claim that: horse in the dungeon = bad game, no horse is the dungeon = good game.\n\nThere would be no fun, if for every rule there was a ton of exceptions. This axe gives +2 attack. But only 1 if you are a woman, or a hobbit. Woman hobbit can't wield it. Exception: if you are an orc woman, +2 bonus applies. Also woman blacksmith gets full bonus. If you are on horseback, there is 1/6 chance that Axe will give double damage. But only if the horse has been trained to have a rider. Otherwise, no bonus. Also, if the horse is trained, but you are charging during a rain or snow, make this bonus to just 1/12. If the average wind speed is above 70 km per hours (or miles if you prefer), than having such axe is a big risk and can result in some random damage if you don't wear greaves. Horse can't be brought to the dungeon. Exception: if horse has been trained whole life and it's size is ok (so the dungeon is very wide), horse can go. But you can't charge on its back if it is really dark. Unless the hall is very high and horse feels safe. Most importantly, whenever you enter a dungeon room, you need to check if horse will be able to rotate freely, it depends on the dungeon room of course. Oh , and no eagles in the dungeon. Dragons obviously CAN be in the dungeon, because we are all used to this and don't question it.

I have been trying to express this all along. Of course there are characters more important to the story, and the beauty of the story is that the most ordinary (even though that is very relative) characters can do great things. But as far as the most powerful characters go (at the end of Third Age Middle-earth) Glorfindel is surely among them.

My experience with Outlands decks is that card draw is THE KEY to winning, so I'll give the lady of Lorien a try. My vulnerability in early game survivability is mitigated by 3 Envoys of Pelargir plus 3 Westfold Horse-breeders, while Galadriel's 4 HP can normally absorb at least 1 undefended hit, while this deck's card draw is insane to get all required pieces asap and get the engine running: Beravor, Galadriel, 3 Hunters of Lamedon, 3 Daeron's Runes, 3 Deep Knowledge, not to mention 3 Gandalfs and 3 Sneak Attacks in desperate cases.\n\n \n\nSo my question is this: does a copy of Asfaloth attached to Galadriel merits a spot in that deck? Placing just 1 progress token in a location is slow and Asfaloth costs 2. Still, it's better than nothing and, with 3 Horse-breeders in the deck, chances are good that the mount will come into my hand, thinning my deck all the while. What do you guys think? Shall I include him? The other cards that fight with him for the 50th spot are: 1 Gleowine (perhaps a little redundant in my deck, since I already sport much draw), 1 Power of Orthanc (silver bullet in specific quests - a potential discard with Daeron's Runes in most cases), 1 Henamarth Riversong (strangely, not for his ability, but mainly for being a cheap chump blocker till the Outlands machine gets going), 1 Nenya (though Galadriel's ability is so much better and I have no means of standing heroes in my deck - I simply have no use of one) or 1 Will of the West (torn about this in a deck that needs to draw Outlands asap).\n\n \n\nIf we were back in the Mirkwood and Dwarrowdelf days, I wouldn't have asked you that question; Asfaloth would surely be in, since most locations had few quest points. This is no longer the case and Asfaloth without Glorfindel is too slow and expensive for what he does. He adds an element that my deck is lacking however.\n\n \n\nYour suggestions?\n\nEdited November 29, 2014 by Serazu"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65242-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=1351013","commentId":1351013,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1417285438,"content":"My suggestion?

Yeah, your right.. it is not really needed so to speak if you use him in the \"old way\". Back in the day it was as a way to remove locations completely from the staging area before you travel to them. Now with penalties for having progress tokens hanging about in the staging area and large quest count locations this method of clearing is no longer the best approach in many quests. Far better is to try and clear a traveled location every round. This keeps the staging area low and you find that it is a accumulative effect. This is why the Lorien Guide is making a comeback. Asfaloth can be used in this exact same manner. To add tokens to the traveled location regardless of if you quest successfully or not. The Guides and Asfaloth are among the only real options you have if you are under questing, as when that location is removed, you drop the entire staging area threat.\n\n \n\nSo like all things it really depends on the quest and more importantly on your deck.

It is a massive investment in your deck design to run him, usually a minimum of  3 deck slots (3x Light of Valinor) and often 5 (+2x Asfaloth) Then if your running that 5, you might be forcing a Lore leader and I have even seen people put in Master of the Forge to speed up the attachment fetches.\n\n \n\nSo on a bad build you might be looking at 9 deck slots just to field him, and his hero has no native ability. Just stats.\n\n \n\nNow I am not saying he is a bad hero, he is very strong, but he heavily affects your deck build due to the amount of support he needs taking up your deck slots.
