Voice of Isengard was announced last August with the release for Xmas. Then it was late January I believe but I still believed at least the adventure packs would start coming out regularly with only a slight delay after the deluxe. Their opening pack, Dunland Trap, was announced to be out early Q2, this was still early in the year, so I again had a false belief that such a feat was more than achievable. Yet, May is now quickly waning and Dunland Trap is not out. The Road Darkens has for some time now been scheduled for Q2 but an experienced buyer of the game can hardly believe ffg to ever keep their release promises.\n\n \n\nAre you, as me, down-hearted by this?

And three would be enough I say: one announcement, one about the story for example, and one show-casing new strategy (with given player card or two). That way you can still spoil no more than three or four player cards and a few encounters and everybody is happy, or happier.

At least according to English as we know it, the definition of lying is exactly: Not telling the truth.\n> \n> I coppied the text from the Oxford dictionary. Sometimes it is better not to make up stuff either.\n\nExcuse me, but what definition from the Oxford Dictionary did you find? \n\nMy oxford dictionary says this for the first meaning of lying: An intentionally false statement\n\nThe only statement I can find that matches yours is the use of lying as an adjective, on the merriam-webster dictionary website (who I don't really rate, as I find most of their word definitions are too simplistic and actually miss out a lot of meaning).\n\nI have found no instances of lie (noun, verb) which do not refer to intent as well as being factually wrong,and I will go further than that and state categorically that such an instance will not exist. A lie is defined as intentional deception (synonyms: dishonest). This is English as we know it.\n\nJust being wrong (without intent to deceive) is NOT lying.\n\nI was merely saying that I didn't think FFG were lying; I think they're wrong. They provide the information to us in good faith. I really don't think they will change anything on their scheduling from any complaints. It does look like Q2 will prove to be incorrect this time as they only have two weeks to hit that deadline.\n\nOn the other hand the entirety of the upcoming section of the ffg website is predicated with the word expected: so none of it is actually a hard and fast commitment.\n\nSo in actual fact I think FFG can't actually miss them; it's like a plumber giving you an estimate for the cost of work,it's a guideline. It isn't the same as a salesman telling you the cost of an item and then charging you something different. The product will be what they say it is, and within a reasonable time-frame of their estimate.\n\n \n\nEdit: Also I think that these forums are for discussion in general, I would be happy to discuss the finer points of lying and truth on them if people wished to do so. I respect the people on this forum and think the conversation could be respectful and interesting - although it isn't game related. \n\nWe could relate it to the game by discussing it in relation to the nebulous table talk rules.\n\n \n\nEdited May 20, 2014 by Rapier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106617-so-are-they-ever-coming-out/?do=findComment&comment=1092960","commentId":1092960,"userName":"asfaloth","timestamp":1400686073,"content":"What is really annoying about this matter is the lack of information.

We began as cheerful and bright-eyed as the happiest of Shire-folk, eager to deliver the first Adventure Pack and its new cards, but our journey wouldn’t prove easy. Along the way, we suffered our first setback with problems at the printer. Once the cards left the printer, the Dark Lord turned his watchful eye toward us. As he sought our shipment, we were delayed not by one, but two random custom checks! Chances are greater we’d meet Master Underhill heading down the Ephel Dúath than we would ever again face two random custom checks on the same shipment. As agents carefully inspected the cards, we could do little but eat our lembas, keep our heads low in our elvish robes, and wait. At length, everything was found in proper order. Now, we have The Hunt for Gollum in our warehouse and have started shipping it to our distributors!\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106617-so-are-they-ever-coming-out/?do=findComment&comment=1094009","commentId":1094009,"userName":"ana4","timestamp":1400739148,"content":">  \n> \n> > Sorry Rapier, but you are lying as well.

It isn't the same as a salesman telling you the cost of an item and then charging you something different. The product will be what they say it is, and within a reasonable time-frame of their estimate.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Edit: Also I think that these forums are for discussion in general, I would be happy to discuss the finer points of lying and truth on them if people wished to do so.

Having read your first claim about lying I did went on to browse for the \"official\" definition in Oxford Dictionary and I did copy and paste what was there. Perhaps I was too quick and I did use the adjective line, or perhaps we have different navigations. But I see, your citation makes sense. But it was not me who went for the philosophy about lying in the first place.\n\nOne more linguistic detail, before I am off. I would not mention this to a non-native speakers but someone as sophisticated as you should not be using \"it's\" as a pronoun, as you almost always seem to be doing, \"it's\" only abbreviates \"it is\" or \"it has\" whilst the pronoun is \"its\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106617-so-are-they-ever-coming-out/?do=findComment&comment=1100558","commentId":1100558,"userName":"VladVoivode","timestamp":1401289995,"content":"I simply cannot believe all of the infantile whining I've read in this thread.

I am a professional musician and magician and I would have loved having my instruments and books with me on the day I landed here. But the cost to ship it all was in the five figure range by air! By sea, the whole thing cost just over 3,000 USD door to door and that included packing and insurance. The downside was that I had ti wait five weeks for my stuff to arrive.\n\n \n\nLOTR has become a huge game. The number of blogs and other resources for the game seem to only be rivaled by MTG.
