You don't lose anything, except maybe a few packs they still gonna maybe release after those already planned? And judging by FFG's other edition improvements, what you are saying is not a possibility, every existing new edition for a past game that I am aware of was a tremendous improvement, be it LCG or a board game.  So, if we used the selfishness scale for this situation, you're selfish by around 99/100, while I'm selfish by 1/100. I have most of the first edition purchased too, you know. I will too \"lose\" if they were to decide to release second edition.

I think there is much more reasons behind not doing second edition than simple \"0.001% of the playerbase that are vocal on the forums don't want it\". If I was a betting man, my money would be on the risk of it not returning as much profit and/or licensing issues being the actual main reason for that.\n\nI don't know how they can \"reiterate\" the game with so many cards being designed around the old rules.

39 months after release of core):\n\nEagles --  fully formed but weak; it would take Hirgon/TaEowyn to take it to the next step.\n\nDwarves -- fully formed and likely more powerful than now, thanks to errata [Dwarrowdelf/Hobbit]\n\nGondor -- fully formed [AtS]\n\nOutlands -- fully formed [AtS]\n\nHobbit -- viable for hobbit heroes [Black Riders], non-existent for allies\n\nRohan -- fair amount of cards, but needing SpTheoden\n\nSilvan -- Celeborn/Tree People released, no O Lorien and enter-plays Silvans thin on the ground\n\nEnt -- no Ents released at all\n\nDunedain -- no unifying principle, let alone enablers\n\nNoldor -- no unifying principle, let alone enablers\n\nHarad -- non-existent\n\nDale -- one hero and one overpriced, useless ally\n\nWoodmen -- non-existent\n\nBeorning -- Beorn hero, Beorn ally, and the overpriced coaster Beorning Beekeeper\n\nSo after three years, three months there were five viable tribal decks, and two years from core release (Heirs of Numenor) there were just three.  A \"second iteration\" that can draw from the existing card pool can create new archtypes with a single card (see contracts).  The most recent cycle created three new tribal archtypes while simultaneously giving *major* support to Eagles, Silvans, and Hobbits.  A reboot *plus* a complete cycle might get you to the point where you can build a decent 50-card deck, as long as it's not monosphere.\n\nOf course, since a second reboot isn't constrained by compatibility, it could abandon entirely the idea of mix-n-match heroes and cards, instead focusing around self-contained heroes that carry their own decks with them -- this would let them create viable decks from day one -- it would also fundamentally change one of the greatest attractions of the current game -- it wouldn't be an incompatible \"better version\" of the current game, it would be a completely different game sharing theme and artwork.\n\nFFG has already made an incompatible version sharing artwork, theme, and some mechanical elements for the  computer.  How many players of this game have abandoned this to play it instead?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299409-ffg-ama-with-andrew-navarro/?do=findComment&comment=3775155","commentId":3775155,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1567263500,"content":"> 23 minutes ago, John Constantine said:\n> \n> I'm not judging by how it used to release at the beginning, I'm juding by how other fresh LCG releases come out now.\n\nWhy?  Are there any second editions of cooperative LCGs to compare to?\n\nIf you imagine a second edition would release at the same pace as a brand new cooperative LCG, we know the Marvel Champions has an *intended* release schedule of once per month, with the majority being hero packs and minority being scenario packs, with no announced schedule for \"Campaign expansions\".  Sounds very much like the *intended* release schedule for LOTR to me.  The significant difference to me is the separation of player cards from scenarios, and the alteration of deckbuilding to make heroes come with synergistic deck element, at the expense of the combinations possible in LOTR LCG."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299409-ffg-ama-with-andrew-navarro/?do=findComment&comment=3775213","commentId":3775213,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1567270142,"content":"I have now watched the video and put myself in the “cautiously optimistic “ category.  Caleb has talked about bringing more of a story telling or saga style element into the game and maybe that’s what’s being envisioned here.\n\nRegarding the 2.0 vs 1b argument, put me firmly in the 1b category.  I’m not saying the game is perfect, but I don’t believe the game’s problems are structural.  Yes, Spirit and Lore got too much of the color pie and Tactics and Leadership didn’t get enough, but I don’t believe that can’t be handled with errata or future cards.  I do not want to go back to the very limited card pool we had for so many years.  Furthermore, if there was a complete reboot people would be wanting the sagas all over and I don’t think the designers really want to go back there again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299409-ffg-ama-with-andrew-navarro/?do=findComment&comment=3775401","commentId":3775401,"userName":"soullos","timestamp":1567289814,"content":"So, lately I've been reading my older D&D books, mainly 3e.

I have friends struggling to find deluxe sets in the UK. FFG reprint quest packs from time to time but what's the point when there's not enough deluxe sets out there that the quest packs require. Buying a quest pack for the player cards only (because you cant play the quest without the deluxe counterpart) is poor. The deluxe to quest pack tie-in model only really works if you can guarantee market supply and demand of the deluxe enabler. \n\nThe LCG model was a new innovation in card gaming for those burnt out on the rare-chasing nature of previous collectable trading games. FFG boasted no rares to chase... everyone gets everything in the pack. But by the lack of reprints coming they've made cards extremely rare and chaseable as people in the second hand market puts these sets on sale at ridiculously expensive prices and are now even selling singles for stupid prices. The game as become that horrible collectors nightmare that LCGs were created to not be.. \n\nSo I hope a second or new iteration firstly solves this problem and creates exciting jumping on points for new players.\n\n \n\nI'd like to see a completely new core set (that's not a second edition) but the start of a new campaign with player new cards in it and army/faction cards and treasures and player card locations. Clarified and explained rules. Then the packs can be like the new marvel releases- one pack is one complete scenario focusing on a lieutenant or location. And hero packs that focus on a hero his/her race, Havens, factions, events, contracts and equipment.\n\nEasy mode, and nightmare need to be better incorporated into the game rather than separate nightmare packs too. \n\n****, I'd even love for a silmarilion version of the game that's compatible.\n\nI love this game and have everything but I have friends desperate to spend their cash on this game but cant get packs and deluxes for love nor money. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299409-ffg-ama-with-andrew-navarro/?do=findComment&comment=3777036","commentId":3777036,"userName":"Tyrion Gru","timestamp":1567542018,"content":"Maybe it's time to speculate on what might be arriving in this Cycle, before the development break in LOTR LCG.
