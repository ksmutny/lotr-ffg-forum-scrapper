This is why we are going to play it against easier scenarios and we may even be using Easy Mode. This format was never intended for scenarios like Into Ithilien or Helm's Deep. This is all just theory right now, but I will report back after I run this at the local Austin LotR group next week."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178628-a-draft-format-for-the-grey-company-listener-event-at-gencon-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1642273","commentId":1642273,"userName":"Qaanaaq","timestamp":1433007702,"content":"fascinating idea. it kind of brings in a bit of competitivity by including the deckbuilding skill into the play experience, and thus allowing the showcasing of mastery, yet still retains the cooperative aspect too. pity im half a globe away."}]}
