Mirlonde died early on from an In Need of Rest. I got to stage 2B where I shuffled all my discarded cards back into my draw deck. Now.. I had Vilya on Elrond and was thinking: what would happen if Mirlonde was the revealed card, would I be able to put her back into play?\n\n \n\nSimply, can Vilya put a hero back into play after they got shuffled back into your deck?? I would say yes since there is nothing limiting you from putting into play that hero card through Vilya's ability. And if this is so, that could be pretty powerful if you use Will of the West or The White Counsil to then use Vilya and revive a hero but of course there is still a lot of chance and it would be rare to actually pull this off.\n\n \n\nSorry if this has already been discussed, I couldn't find a previous answer though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112635-vilya-to-bring-a-hero-back/?do=findComment&comment=1186652","commentId":1186652,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1407367552,"content":"Sorry but no...\n\n \n\nFrom Core Rules:\n\nNote that hero cards that are defeated are placed in their owner’s discard pile.

I don't know what happens to the X - values of the Nameless, but after he is defeated you're hero is a goner as well.\n\nGreetz\n\nPS: I'll make a topic for this perticular case"}]}
