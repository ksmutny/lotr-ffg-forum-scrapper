Or if you prefer a more thematic experience play on easy mode or just starting with an extra resource and then more heroes/decks become viable then just he too handful of power ones. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301497-one-deck-to-rule-them-all/?do=findComment&comment=3814668","commentId":3814668,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1572012712,"content":"> 21 hours ago, Markspinner said:\n> \n>  \n> \n> The way I approach Arkham Horror LCG deckbuilding is to create one deck only from that cycle's campaign.  Is that viable in this game (or even including the entire card pool)?\n\nPossible? Yes. Viable . . . ? Only if you're a veteran."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301497-one-deck-to-rule-them-all/?do=findComment&comment=3814690","commentId":3814690,"userName":"AllWingsStandyingBy","timestamp":1572014117,"content":"> 19 hours ago, Markspinner said:\n> \n> I guess I should mention that I only been playing one handed and maybe that is why I'm getting spanked...\n\n\nWhen I am testing decks (playing solo), I also play 1-Handed Solo.  I use Passage Through Mirkwood (Core Quest #1) and Journey Down the Anduin (Core Quest #2) as the benchmarks.  That said, I don't necessarily look at these as things a deck has to \"beat\" solo in order to be a good deck or even a good experience.  Even my best decks probably average about 50/50 against the Anduin River in 1-Handed Solo, but a deck can show off its chops even in a loss to that quest: how were it's starting hand draws?  How was it's economy in the early rounds?  What did it do well?  What did it struggle with?  Were there any cards/combos that seemed really useful, or some that seemed to be useless?  These all give a better and better picture about a deck and can help tweak and refine it.\n\nWhile the game does an overall admirable job of scaling up or down for the number of players, some quests are just much harder in true (read: 1-Handed) solo than with two decks.  The Anduin river is one such quest.  In 1-Handed, players are responsible for 100% of a Hill Troll, versus just 50% in 2 Player (or 25% in 4-Player).  Same goes for Stage 2B, where you reveal an extra card.  In one player, that means 2 Encounter Cards per player.  In 2 Player its only 1.5 cards per player (and only 1.25 cards per player in 4-Player).\n\nIt is possible to solo it (and it's a great feeling when you do), but I'd encourage also finding a mindset that can find a lot of value and enjoyment in games that are losses as well (I certainly have almost as much fun playing whether I win or lose)."}]}
