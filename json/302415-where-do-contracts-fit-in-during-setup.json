Place heroes\" and looking at Heroes that had a Setup:\n\nDenethor (Leadership): Setup: Add 2 resources to Denethor's resource pool.\n\nEowyn (Tactics): Setup: Reduce your threat by 3.\n\nSmeagol: Setup: Shuffle 2 copies of Stinker into the encounter deck.\n\nThurindir: Setup: Search your deck for a side quest and add it to your hand. Shuffle your deck.\n\nAs heroes go, Thurindir is probably the closest in question. Do I:\n\n2) Place Thurindir and execute his Setup, adding a side quest to my \"empty\" hand, then\n\n5) Draw Starting Hand\n\nMy questions of when and timing stem from the The Grey Wanderer contract. Can the Setup of The Grey Wanderer contract be played after \"5. Draw Starting Hand\"? I would like to find out what is in my starting hand before \"Search your deck for an attachment ...\" If the answer is No, the Setup must be played before drawing your starting hand, The Grey Wanderer contract creates a dilemma the way it is printed. It does not say \"Shuffle your deck\" after searching. Therefore you get the chance to \"see\" your starting hand as you are searching for the attachment.\n\n> 3 hours ago, sappidus said:\n> \n> (This raises the question of what exactly happens if you choose a Guarded (X) attachment for the Grey Wanderer contract, as the encounter deck isn't really set up at that point to grab a guarding card from…)\n\nI had a similar question of \"can we use a Guarded (X) card without needing to guard it?\" Looking at Guarded (X), it says \"enters play\" and the The Grey Wanderer contract says \"put it into play\", so I assume that might mean we still have to guard it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302415-where-do-contracts-fit-in-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3831179","commentId":3831179,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1574054956,"content":"You have touched on several different points here. I will try to address the big ones.\n\n> 5 hours ago, bdavis969 said:\n> \n> As heroes go, Thurindir is probably the closest in question.
