Grima's ability takes place before you need to pay the cost of the next card ( Grima's ability and paying is 2 different things) also it doesn't negate (i don't see any \"does not\" there) the need to pay any amount of spirit (or any spheres) resources its just lowers the cost.

This applies to you too iznax.\n\n \n\n--------\n\n \n\niznax, you're not seeing the point we're trying to make. Generally a sensible person would consider exhausting to be the cost of questing, attacking, and defending. The rules say:\n \n\n>  \n> \n> An exhausted card cannot exhaust again (and therefore cannot partake in any action that requires exhaustion).\n\n \n\nBut Light of Valinor and Beorn say that you DO NOT EXHAUST to quest/defend (we are not exhausting again, which is what this rule is talking about). Therefore the exhaust cost is removed, making questing/defending just like any Action keyword on a card that doesn't require you to exhaust. An exhausted Lore Glorfindel can use his healing ability just fine because it does not require him to exhaust. The only difference is that committing to the quest and attacking and defending happen at very specific times and don't require you to have a card to do them.\n\n \n\nCaleb's reply is odd to me. He says:\n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> The intent of this rule is a core mechanic of the game: exhausted heroes cannot perform actions. They cannot quest, attack, or defend.\n\n \n\nBut exhausted heroes CAN perform actions! As long as that action does not require exhausting, which is exactly what LoV does for questing. He then says \"They cannot quest, attack, or defend,\" which, combined with \"the intent of this rule is a core mechanic of the game\" makes it sound like he's saying \"since we made questing/attacking/defending a core part of the game instead of being actions on the cards, we can twist the rules to say that you can't be exhausted, even if the requirement of exhausting is removed.\"\n\n \n\nI don't know. Just seems like he's trying to make up excuses to have the ruling applied the way he thinks it should be applied. The only thing in what he said that makes me care about listening to him is the word \"intent\". I'm well aware that the people who write the rules can't/don't always think of everything when they write the rules down. Therefore, if he knows that the intent of the rules was that we shouldn't be able to do this if we're already exhausted, then I'm ok with it, but the rules then need to be rewritten in a way that explains:\n\n \n\n\"If a character is exhausted, it may not perform an action that normally requires it to exhaust, even if the requirement to exhaust has been removed by a card effect.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107188-one-little-thing-that-eluded-my-mind/?do=findComment&comment=1100469","commentId":1100469,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1401287435,"content":"Forums is not privilege.

However that doesn't mean the action loses that requirement.\n\nSo you can Quest first then do other things - as you don't pay the exhaustion cost for the first action. Similarly Beorn can defend first.\n\nEach time the order of operations is:\n\n1) Check for character exhaustion. (You're not permitted to perform another action that requires exhaustion if you fail this check).\n\n2) Exhaust the character.\n\n3) Perform the action.\n\n \n\nLov and Beorn ignore step 2. Therefore they can continue to meat the not being exhausted requirement (per the rule quoted in the first post), and can act again.\n\nHowever to have a case where  character that was previously exhausted could still attack or defend would require you to ignore step 1 not step 2.\n\nPeople seem to think that \"does not exhaust\" is the same as saying \"the action no longer requires exhaustion\" and these are not the same.\n\nThe first one (the one we have) allows you to ignore one step, the other would fundamentally change the way one action operated in line with the rest of the game.

It's not written out as clearly as that in the rules. I was furthering my argument that Caleb has not been inconsistent. The fact that it should be clarrified to avoid confusion i completely agree with.\n\nAs for the addition of the passive effect as step 1, it could go there - but I would argue that passive effects would not be covered by an operation, rather they would be covered by a layer type effect. (The passive effect layer would be above the active layer).\n\nYou could have Check passive effects as additional steps but it would have to be written before and after every other step to reflect how they work in the game (which is why I would use a different logical layout for them).\n\nHowever, even if step 1 said, you don't have to exhaust (Which would be written as ignore step 3) you would 'still'  need to do step two. \n\nThe fact is that people are conflating two different things.\n\nDoes not exhaust - means ignore the exhausting aspect of a specific instance (defence, attack, quest)\n\nAn action requires exhaustion if that action has exhaustion as part of it's requirements.\n\nIf you do not have to exhaust that does not mean that exhaustion is not a requirement, it just means you don't have to pay that requirement when you normally would/\n\nHowever to perform an action that requires exhaustion you have to not already be exhausted, hence LoV and Beorn can do their specials first and then another action but cannot do it in reverse.\n\nThe reverse version would need to be written from the other point of view: \"This character can be declared as a defender even when exhausted\"\n\nThis is because rules are restrictive in nature, you need a rule that allows something to occur, otherwise it can't.\n\n\n\n \n\n> People seem to think that \"does not exhaust\" is the same as saying \"the action no longer requires exhaustion\" and these are not the same.\n> \n>  \n\nThat's because the rulebokk doesn't make that difference either.\n\n \n\nWhile I agree the rulebook could have been written better. I think you're asking a bit much if you want them to spell this out - I mean no one in this thread has presented an argument that these two statements are actually synonyms. They're clearly not the same.\n\nThe rulebook doesn't expressly call out a lot of differences that are in plain english - maybe it should (In a Magic the Gathering full rules style) but I also think this game isn't worth that amount of effort the way that Magic is."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107188-one-little-thing-that-eluded-my-mind/?do=findComment&comment=1101884","commentId":1101884,"userName":"Demoncow","timestamp":1401376431,"content":"From guide to forum use:\n\ncommunity.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/33517-guide-to-forum-use/\n\n\"Treat everyone (users or not) with respect, while enjoying the freedom to disagree with their ideas.\"\n\n \n\nHow bout it?\n\nEdited May 29, 2014 by Demoncow"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107188-one-little-thing-that-eluded-my-mind/?do=findComment&comment=1101903","commentId":1101903,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1401376890,"content":"> ...\n> \n> Each time the order of operations is:\n> \n> 1) Check for character exhaustion.

That doesn't actually model how the game works when it comes to performing actions, the system you've laid out would treat actions and paying for cards as identical, but the game isn't like that.\n\nTherefore you need to have a more detailed model. The model for paying for a card (with resources) wouldn't have a check on the resources as a separate step , because it isn't a \"state\"\n\n1) Choose a card to play\n\n2) Check the card is allowed to be played at this time\n\n3) Pay resources equal to the cards cost\n\n4) Apply card effects to game state.\n\nThere's a distinction between having to check that resources exist and having to actually pay the cost. If you split them up as you wanted to do in your example then you would have effects that checked that you could pay (but then made it so you didn't have too).\n\nHowever the resource payment is instantaneous in this game so they must share a step.\n\nThis is different from exhaustion.\n\nExhaustion is a binary state Ready/Exhausted which applies to all player cards that are in play. At any time a player card must be in one of these two states.\n\nThey are a fundamental game mechanic not a cost. To be able to perform any action in the game that leads to the card changing from Ready to Exhausted, you must begin Ready. (Instances when an Exhausted card can do ~anything~ are explicit in the rules and clearly call out cards in the Exhausted state - such as ready an exhausted card).\n\nLoV makes no reference to exhausted cards. It says that you can perform an action without becoming exhausted. (This leaves the card in the ready state, therefore it can perform another action).\n\nThis is NOT the same as saying, this card can do something while exhausted. (A model of the wording that the game would use for this doesn't actually exist because there are no game effects of this kind yet, I propose, this card can defend while exhausted - but they may word it differently).\n\nI could try to re-write my order of operations example as a series of  if > then statements if that would be clearer for people."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107188-one-little-thing-that-eluded-my-mind/?do=findComment&comment=1101956","commentId":1101956,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1401378873,"content":"My biggest problem is that we don't consider being required to exhaust a card as part of the cost.

When you're exhausted you can perform any action that doesn't require you to exhaust. For example, Westfold Horse-Breaker can discard himself regardless of being exhausted. Since they keep being called \"actions\", Questing, Attacking, and Defending should be treated just like any other actions with the exception that they can only happen at very specific points during each round.\n\n\n\n> To my mind that isn't the case.\n> \n> What would you prefer it to say to make it clearer for you?\n\nI would like it to actually say that being ready is a requirement. The rules say:\n\n \n\n\n\n> An exhausted card cannot exhaust again (and therefore cannot partake in any action that requires exhaustion).\n\nThe rules do not say \"A character must be ready in order quest, attack, defend, or perform an action that requires exhaustion.\" I'm not exhausting again, so therefore the existing rule here doesn't apply. The word \"therefore\" in that quote means that it is directly referring to exhausting again and is just a clarification, not a separate rule. Even if it was a separate rule, I \"do not exhaust,\" therefore I'm not required to exhaust.\n\nI'm totally not against changing the rules to say this. I think it's a good idea that we should be ready despite LoV, Beorn, Galadriel, Gandalf, Naith Guide, etc telling us \"do(es) not exhaust,\" because I think that may be a little too powerful. I just want the rules to actually say it.\n\nEdited May 29, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107188-one-little-thing-that-eluded-my-mind/?do=findComment&comment=1102780","commentId":1102780,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1401433014,"content":"> Lol, this person is either an extremely fat troll or is utterly retarded  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]\n> \n> Reminds me of Nerdmeister.\n\nWow... simply just wow.\n\nLast time we had a \"discussion\" (or however you would prefer to classify it) we seemed to arrive at the conclusion that neither of us were going to give each other attention anymore (not that it has kept you out of my threads as you prefer I keep out of yours)\n\n \n\nI have not even remotely approached this thread and still you feel the need to take a punch? Are you really that insecure?\n\n \n\nFact of the matter about this whole topic is that most people think it is obvious that LoV does not work when a character is exhausted and both previous and current responses from the design team has collaborated this viewpoint.\n\nThe argument that it is not in the FAQ is also a stretch since the ruling (both previous and oc current) are known to almost everyone. As well as the fact that it is a coop and not a competitive game and you can play it (cheat yourself if you prefer that wording) however you like.\n\nYou need to get over the fact that you were wrong on all accounts, both on your logic and your reasoning. Though when someone uses a reasoning like \"well you are just like this other guy I don´t like so therefore you are wrong\" that is perhaps too long a stretch?\n\n \n\nYour way of reasoning reminds me of a veiled version of Godwin´s Law (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law] in case you don´t know what that is). Just substitute \"Hitler\" for \"retards\" or any other of your preferred phrases.\n\n \n\nI won´t tell you to stop your baseless slander, because I have come to realize that you are probably incapable of restraint in any way and I won´t waste my time when you obviously will not listen. It seems that every time you are counter-argumented (or people just don´t agree with you 100%) you go to your mental safezone of calling people retards. Funny though: either the whole world except you is retarded... or maybe there is another answer; that the whole world (at large) is right-thinking. Though that would mean there would have to be something wrong with whoever made the claim in the first place. Any thoughts on what that might be?\n\nEdited May 30, 2014 by Nerdmeister"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107188-one-little-thing-that-eluded-my-mind/?do=findComment&comment=1102813","commentId":1102813,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1401435445,"content":">  \n> \n> > I think Caleb's answer is already clarifying the problem. \"exhausted heroes cannot perform actions\".\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > That's even short enough to get the attention of Trololo. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n> \n> Except that's not true.
