One character is exhausted\nto pay for the cost of Quick Strike, and the effect is that\nthe exhausted character is immediately declared as an\nattacker against the target enemy. The card’s resolution\ndoes not allow for a standard declaration step in which\nother characters can declare.\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84511-a-few-doubt-to-clarify/?do=findComment&comment=800357","commentId":800357,"userName":"tamtamnoob","timestamp":1369915946,"content":"Thanks for the quick reply.
