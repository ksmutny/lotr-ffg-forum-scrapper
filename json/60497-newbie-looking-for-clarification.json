This is a major part of the game and I think you should really experiment with this stuff yourself. Still ALL spheres work well with any other sphere. In a 2+ player game as you can cast spells to benefit your partner, the sphere combination is nearly meaningless.\n\nIf you are playing solo though you soon learn that there are some spheres that are a bit weak, due to solo decks needing to handle everything at once. Most people tend to have the best success with tri sphere decks.. so 2 spheres and a splash though the belt or song.\n\nAs for your other things.. You can never attack the same enemy twice with the same character, ever.
