For some reason I don't really feel like I've explored thoroughly Middle-earth, even though we've been to almost everywhere... But I still feel we should return to Mirkwood and that area, it still doesn't feel explored (and we've been there twice). I'd like to see less totally desolate forests and more towns of the Woodmen, the elven city, even though I don't know what could be going on but it should be possible to have more \"good\" places (civilized) in the game. Areas and sites like that should be more visited, the problem is that basically each scenario takes place in one place, like Caradhras, druadan forest, Osgiliath, etc We are not allowed much travel in the game (although it's for a pretty good reason, we're on a quest). But still I'd like to visit the good places more. Maybe to get some item, heal, or something like that. A mechanic such as that I would totally love, even though the hard-core high difficulty players would not like it, lol   "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106418-cool-idea-for-the-next-cycle/?do=findComment&comment=1087500","commentId":1087500,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1400272445,"content":"I'd rather have a journey somewhere else.

In my mind, Sagas are separate from the main game, and were basically an afterthought to the original concept, so the Sagas ending won't really have an impact on the lifespan of the game.
