Just because double sided encounter cards use this logic. Rules for double sided locations in the Grey Havens and following cycle say something like these locations are double sided and “therefore can never be shuffled into the encounter deck.”  So I would suppose the prevailing logic is that being double sided precludes a card from being able to be shuffled into a deck.\n\nWould also apply to having Sméagol in Escape from Mount Gram. Guess he has to be your starting hero if you use him?"}]}
