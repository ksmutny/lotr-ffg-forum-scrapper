The wording of Reforged it's different for example, since it clearly says \"any sphere\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307772-master-ironsmith-and-off-sphere-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=3928492","commentId":3928492,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1587148637,"content":"If it said \"play,\" you MIGHT be in trouble but since it just says \"attach,\" you're good.Â  You only have to have a resource match when you \"play\" a card.\n\nEven if it did say play, you might still be OK, since you're actually not paying the cost anyway. If it did say \"play for 0 cost,\" then you WOULD need a match."}]}
