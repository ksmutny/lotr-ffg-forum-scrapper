If a player is eliminated in action window 3.1A or 3.2A, does that player still count towards the number of cards to be flipped during staging?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306359-when-do-you-determine-the-number-of-players-for-staging/?do=findComment&comment=3904057","commentId":3904057,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1582897741,"content":"AFAIK, the # of cards revealed is determined at the outset of framework step 3.3. So, while it is known that player elimination during staging does not change the # of encounter cards—e.g., this ruling [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/736250/article/8484232#8484232]—I think elimination beforehand means that fewer are revealed.\n\n(BTW, that shorthand of \"3.1A\" is excellent, and I will adopt it from now on.)"}]}
