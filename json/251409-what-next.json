I don't want to spend a lot of money on this game, but I could see myself having a big box or two plus some small expansions by the end of 2017. My question is what are the best expansions that are easily available? I love Middle Earth, so theme is not a concern."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251409-what-next/?do=findComment&comment=2821622","commentId":2821622,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1496636088,"content":"Since the first cycle is now available try the adventures in order."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251409-what-next/?do=findComment&comment=2821775","commentId":2821775,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1496653871,"content":"If you're budget limited, I would hang on for Khazad-Dum and the Dwarrowdelf cycle. This should be available in the next 4 or so weeks, and in my opinion has much better player cards and adventures.\n\nThe Hunt for Gollum cycle was the first, and whilst it is perfectly OK the designers had really got into their stride by Khazad-Dum."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251409-what-next/?do=findComment&comment=2822051","commentId":2822051,"userName":"Felswrath","timestamp":1496671552,"content":"Thanks for the replies! I love this game, but either I'm not very good at it yet, or the core doesn't provide enough cards to actually beat any of the scenarios. I know my skills will improve in time, but it seems like I don't have a very good chance when I can have 2/3 of my heroes be from 1 sphere, but only half of my deck can be from that sphere!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251409-what-next/?do=findComment&comment=2822118","commentId":2822118,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1496673178,"content":"This'll help with regard to purchases:\n\nhttps://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/ [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/]\n\nThis'll help with constructing decent decks with just one core:\n\nhttps://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1108855/back-basics-killer-deck-using-only-cards-single-co/page/1 [https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1108855/back-basics-killer-deck-using-only-cards-single-co/page/1] \n\nBGG in particular is an excellent resource for new players.\n\nHope this helps"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251409-what-next/?do=findComment&comment=2822237","commentId":2822237,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1496677022,"content":"The first two scenarios CAN be beaten with core only decks.  The third... takes a lot."}]}
