Last time we played we saw a 18 threat increase over 4 rounds and a buckload of treacheries we could not respond to, due to it being Night, that really wrecked us."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312665-wastes-of-eriador-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=4017141","commentId":4017141,"userName":"TrueLolzor","timestamp":1605829603,"content":"Interesting. While playing it solo, I was under impression that this quest becomes easier with the player count, due to there being only 1 extra encounter card from night regardless of the number of players, so if in solo you're basically drawing twice the number of encounter cards during the night turn, in 4 player you're drawing just 25% more encounter cards, therefore less pressure."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312665-wastes-of-eriador-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=4017160","commentId":4017160,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1605830828,"content":"> 20 minutes ago, TrueLolzor said:\n> \n> Interesting.

The same can be said for Eriador Wastes (though a well timed Thror's Key can help there)\n\nThe extra encounter card from the Night shift was often less of a problem since there are at least a couple of treacheries that basically do nothing (Biting Winds and Freezing Blast, doomed aside of course).\n\nEdited November 20 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312665-wastes-of-eriador-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=4017582","commentId":4017582,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1605890593,"content":"> 19 hours ago, Alonewolf87 said:\n> \n> I am the only one who finds The Wastes of Eriador exceedingly difficult in 4 players?\n\nI think it is understating it to say: no.

This continued into the later cycles as well, but in general treacheries were a little less \"game-ending\" for 4-player games in the later scenarios."}]}
