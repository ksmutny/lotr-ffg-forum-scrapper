I added a copy of Ithilien Lookout, Boromir (who is amazing in this deck), Wandering Ent and Treebeard. The basic engine of the deck remains the same. Use Secrecy cards in the early game to muster as many allies as quickly as you can. Pippin, Gleowine and Daeron's Runes provide card drawing, while Resourceful and Steward of Gondor provide resource acceleration. I also added 1 copy Protector of Lorien and Hobbit Cloak for Sam. Lastly one copy of Stand and Fight gives me another means for getting a Tactics ally into play (since none of the heroes have that sphere). I have posted the full deck list on the Grey Company Podcast Facebook page, but if you need me to I can track it down and repost it here.\n\nEdited February 10, 2015 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1443297","commentId":1443297,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1423587044,"content":"Heh, 13nrv doesn't pop up in here often, but when he does he always brings some good deck ideas or combos with him.\n\nYou should post your finds more often mate!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134384-quiz/?do=findComment&comment=1443301","commentId":1443301,"userName":"13nrv","timestamp":1423587166,"content":">  \n> \n> > Sorry, i'm french ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n> > \n> > I have forgotten to translate some cards.\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > You're right for envoy of Pelargir and Sylvebarbe (french name) is Treebeard.\n> \n>  \n> \n> 13nrv, part of me really wanted you to make up a story about the different card names, and act like they were exclusive player cards that most people haven't heard of.\n> \n> \"What, you don't use Pelargir Emissary in your decks?
