Non-Rohan characters cannot participate in these attacks, but you may declare any number of Rohan heroes you control as attackers against a single enemy in the staging area. Your friends cannot commit their Rohan heroes to your attack because it's not their attack window. The Ranged keyword does not work during these attacks because the rules for Ranged only apply to enemies engaged with a player.\nHope you enjoy riding down your enemies with the new Rohan player cards!\nCheers,\nCaleb\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100245-forth-eolingas-elaborated/?do=findComment&comment=998574","commentId":998574,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1393582592,"content":"Well that sucks.\n\nKind of thought it was the other way around.\n\nGreatly diminishes the utility of the card IMO.\n\nAnyway, thanks for pointing it out Danny."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100245-forth-eolingas-elaborated/?do=findComment&comment=998641","commentId":998641,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1393591117,"content":"Hama and Theoden are the only one that are great with this event, Theodred and Eowyn should quest and are not that great in combat, Dunhere is better left alone than using this card... so the card suffer from very limited card pool for now.\n\nYou can always put Nor I Am a Stranger on Boromir or Aragorn or Glorfindel or Elladan but guys with ranged might be better with great yew bow.\n\n \n\nSad news is, it must also be the same ruling for ithilien pit."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100245-forth-eolingas-elaborated/?do=findComment&comment=998773","commentId":998773,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1393601523,"content":">  \n> \n> You can always put Nor I Am a Stranger on Boromir or Aragorn or Glorfindel or Elladan but guys with ranged might be better with great yew bow.\n> \n>  \n\nThe point with Nor Am I a Stranger is fine but what does Great Yew Bow ad to Forth Eorlingas?\n\n \n\nYou can also ad even more characters to the mix with\n\n \n\nmed_mutual-accord-hon.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_mutual-accord-hon.jpg]\n\nSeems to me there are ways to take advantage of Forth Eorlingas already"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100245-forth-eolingas-elaborated/?do=findComment&comment=998819","commentId":998819,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1393605671,"content":"> Sad news is, it must also be the same ruling for ithilien pit.\n\nWut?\n\nThat can't be right...."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100245-forth-eolingas-elaborated/?do=findComment&comment=998849","commentId":998849,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1393607771,"content":"@noccus : same reason to me... but Caleb might answer something different ?\n\n \n\n@nerdmeister : I said that great yew bow is better than forth eorlingas if you are playing with ranged character and want to deckbuild to attack the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100245-forth-eolingas-elaborated/?do=findComment&comment=998865","commentId":998865,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1393608876,"content":"> @nerdmeister : I said that great yew bow is better than forth eorlingas if you are playing with ranged character and want to deckbuild to attack the staging area.\n\nAh ok, that was not entirely clear.\n\nWell yes if you want to deckbuild for attacking the staging area.\n\nIf you want to deckbuild for Rohan/Gondor synergy then it is another matter."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100245-forth-eolingas-elaborated/?do=findComment&comment=998917","commentId":998917,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1393612856,"content":"> @noccus : same reason to me... but Caleb might answer something different ?\n\nCan I read in this that you asked for a ruling?\n\nIf not, my take on the pit is that it does work; as the wording is quite different.\n\nIt says ANY character.
