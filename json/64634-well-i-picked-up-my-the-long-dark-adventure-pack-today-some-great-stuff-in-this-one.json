I would just put in a bunch of cheap 1-cost tactics events and a handful of Tactics allies who are geared specifically toward blocking. With a Rohan centered theme, a lot of event cards I don't normally play would suddenly find themselves as the centerpiece of their very own deck concept. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI don't buy the complaints about not being able to block if you have more than one enemy and are repeatedly throwing Feint at one of them. No smart player who has the option would be blocking with a hero anyway, unless of course he/she is in control of the specific combat situation (ie a Lore character with a 2 defense with Burning Brand on it blocking a 2 attack enemy, or Hasty Stroke in his/her hand when he/she blocks with the hero). If you are having blocking issues, put more allies in your deck.\n\nCurious to know what else is in this set, if anyone has time to post the cards. Player cards I mean, not encounter cards.
