WRL ought to be numbered SoM 121 (it seems), while Eomund is correctly numbered SoM 30. This kind of misprint isn't terribly frustrating (it seems to me), what really bugs me is a when a (well-known) direct quote is misspelled. This is the case on Dwarrowdelf 132 which reads \"O Elbereth! Gilthonial!\" rather than \"A Elbereth! Gilthoniel!\" I mean it's a direct quote (that is repeated several times) from an Elvish hymn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70310-misprint/?do=findComment&comment=686294","commentId":686294,"userName":"NotAZombie","timestamp":1346535541,"content":" Ah, didn't know about the alternate spelling.
