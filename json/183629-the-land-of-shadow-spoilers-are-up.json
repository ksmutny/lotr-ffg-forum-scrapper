You always end up with an empty hand thanks to Theoden's discount, and the lack of card draw in those spheres means you won't be able to play more allies consistently. Gamling takes care of that, thematically enough. It's kind of a bummer that you have to exhaust him, but when you have a deck full of Escort from Edoras, Westfold Horse breaker, Helm! Helm! Ride to Ruin, Hama, etc, he could really be invaluable. I really feel that now the Rohan trait has come full circle. Maybe it's not as powerful as Silvan or other such decks, but it really feels powerful now.\n\n \n\nEnts are bonkers, and will be even more bonkers in the future. Glad to see that trait developed.\n\n \n\nI wonder how effective this whole \"higher engagement threat\" mechanic will be in non-hobbit decks. The staff will be awesome for Sam obviously, but for the rangers of Ithilien... I don't know. With a starting threat of at least 20 with Faramir and Damrod (again, I'm thinking in solo), that mechanic seems like it could fizzle easily.
