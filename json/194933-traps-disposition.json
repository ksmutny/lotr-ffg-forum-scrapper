The idea is that you might want a different type of trap before a trap already in place for strategic reasons.\n\n \n\n2-when an enemy enters into the staging area, must you attach it to the first trap to the left of the staging area or, if you have different types of traps in play, can you choose to what trap you're gonna attach the enemy?\n\n \n\nThanx! \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n** Actually, Ranger spikes on those trolls is legal... from an old ruling in this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79258-trolls-and-ranger-spikes/?hl=%2Btroll+%2Branger+%2Bspikes]:\n\n \n\n\"You are correct. The Ranger Spikes are played into the staging area and not on the trolls. Therefore, the troll's game text 'Players cannot play attachmentson Troll enemies' does not apply.

Makes sense, thematically.\n\nEdited December 4, 2015 by Lecitadin"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194933-traps-disposition/?do=findComment&comment=2445764","commentId":2445764,"userName":"Laco","timestamp":1475771708,"content":"Rules Question:\n> Hello! How is it with multiple traps in staging area and multiple enemies incoming here at the same time? Like trolls in We Must Away, Ere Break of Day scenario, or trolls in Conflict at the Carrock scenario. Can I choose which enemy goes to witch trap? Or one enemy goes to all trap? Thanks for your answer. Laco.\n\n \n\nHi Laco,\n\nWhenever several effects resolve simultaneously, it is up to the first player to decide how they resolve. If you have multiple traps in the staging area when you advance to stage 2 of Conflict at the Carrock and add 4 Troll enemies to the staging area, the first player will decide which enemy to attach each trap to because they are all valid targets.\nNow if there were multiple traps in the staging area when just 1 enemy was added to the staging area, then each trap would be attached to that enemy.\nCheers,\nCaleb"}]}
