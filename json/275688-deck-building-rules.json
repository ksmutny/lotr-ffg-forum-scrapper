Is it ok to use any player cards from any expansion pack for any quest? Is it ok to use player cards from saga expansions and delux expansions in the same deck? Are there any restrictions or recommendations? Thanks. Dave. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/275688-deck-building-rules/?do=findComment&comment=3326635","commentId":3326635,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1525989703,"content":"It is OK to use any neutral/leadership/lore/spirit/tactics cards from any expansion against any quest, unless it's explicitly disallowed by the rules.  (For example, you can't use Faramir for a couple of quests because he's already in them).  The sagas also have some player cards that are confined to that particular saga in the \"Baggins\" or \"Fellowship\" spheres.\n\nYou may not have more than three copies of a card with the same name in a single deck.  To be \"tournament legal\" you must have at least 50 cards in your deck -- there's no tournaments, but treat this as a firm rule once you get a decent amount of cards (at least core + one cycle).\n\nCards with a unique symbol may only have one copy in play -- you may have three copies in your deck, but unless the card is critical you may not want to, since only one will ordinarily be played."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/275688-deck-building-rules/?do=findComment&comment=3326656","commentId":3326656,"userName":"daverayjord","timestamp":1525990376,"content":"> 9 minutes ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> It is OK to use any neutral/leadership/lore/spirit/tactics cards from any expansion against any quest, unless it's explicitly disallowed by the rules.  (For example, you can't use Faramir for a couple of quests because he's already in them).  The sagas also have some player cards that are confined to that particular saga in the \"Baggins\" or \"Fellowship\" spheres.\n> \n> You may not have more than three copies of a card with the same name in a single deck.  To be \"tournament legal\" you must have at least 50 cards in your deck -- there's no tournaments, but treat this as a firm rule once you get a decent amount of cards (at least core + one cycle).\n> \n> Cards with a unique symbol may only have one copy in play -- you may have three copies in your deck, but unless the card is critical you may not want to, since only one will ordinarily be played.\n\nThank you Dale.
