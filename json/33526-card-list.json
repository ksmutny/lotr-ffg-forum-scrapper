Indeed, in the early drafting of The Council of Elrond, he planned on having Glorfindel recount his part in the tale of Gondolin, but then forgot about that plan, and indeed seemed to forget that he intended them to be one and the same, until about 1972, which is when the essays on Glorfindel have been dated by Christopher Tolkien. He did admit that it was an unfortunate circumstance that if they were two separate people, that they should share a name, and he held that having Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rinvendell as the same person could in fact enhance the story.
