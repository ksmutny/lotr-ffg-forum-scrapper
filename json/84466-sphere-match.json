Resource Icons: Found only on hero cards, these icons indicate the sphere(s) of influence to which resource tokens in this hero’s resource pool belong. They also indicate to which sphere(s) the hero card itself belongs.\"\n\nand pg. 4, \"spheres of influence\": \"There are four different spheres of influence in The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, and each has its own distinct flavor and identity. Most player cards fall under one of these spheres, represented by a unique icon, as well as by a unique color on its card border. Each hero has an emphasis in one of these four spheres. A hero’s sphere dictates the types of cards that hero allows a player to use.\"\n\nMy take - the \"sphere resource icon\" and the \"sphere to which a hero belongs\" are different things (via my emphasis in the above passage).  A Song only gives a resource icon, so Good Meal wouldn't work if the icon is granted via a Song.  The Song's text explicitly states that the hero only gains a resource icon -- not that the hero now belongs to sphere X."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84466-sphere-match/?do=findComment&comment=800074","commentId":800074,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1369850067,"content":"thanks - that seems to make sense\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84466-sphere-match/?do=findComment&comment=800371","commentId":800371,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1369920267,"content":"i sent a rules request and it turns out its the opposite\n\nHi Richard,\nThat's a good question. Since the resource icon indicates which sphere a hero belongs to, if a hero gains an additional resource icon from a card effect, then the hero will belong to that sphere as well. That will allow you to combo cards like Good Meal with the song cards.\nCheers,\nCaleb\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84466-sphere-match/?do=findComment&comment=800481","commentId":800481,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1369949527,"content":"Thanks for that! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84466-sphere-match/?do=findComment&comment=800536","commentId":800536,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1369967820,"content":"Now we just need a dwarf/hobbit halfbreed for that nasty Narvi´s Belt + Good Meal combo burla [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/burlon.gif]"}]}
