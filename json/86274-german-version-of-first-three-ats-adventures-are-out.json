The only thing which I stumbled about are \"quest points\" (=Abenteuerpunkte). Never heard that before, but apparently they mean the threat of the locations? I mean the translation is correct, but did they use that expression on English cards?\n\n \n\nBtw, we are still waiting for OtD in Germany.

This quest already puts a fair amount of pressure on you from locations, and those two player cards are usually the go-to answer for handling locations. The effect on Roots of Mindolluin (\"Each location in the staging area gets +2 quest points\") significantly counteracts those cards.\n\n \n\nIt shows the designers have obviously learnt a thing or two since the likes of Hills of Emyn Muil..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86274-german-version-of-first-three-ats-adventures-are-out/?do=findComment&comment=816168","commentId":816168,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1374082708,"content":"I hear you, scwont.
