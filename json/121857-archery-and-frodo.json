Can we deal more Archery damage on a character that it has hit points? If there is two Silvan Refugees, can we assign 1 archery damage to both?\n> A: Damage from Archery keyword cannot be over-assigned to characters you control. It must be divided among characters you control until either there is no damage left to assign or no characters left to assign it to. The damage is applied simultaneously, so you can assign damage to more than 1 Silvan Refugee because their Forced effect will not trigger until after all the damage has been assigned.\n\nSo it is not done 1 by 1."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121857-archery-and-frodo/?do=findComment&comment=1260873","commentId":1260873,"userName":"DaeMord","timestamp":1410618736,"content":"> I agree with alogos, you should be able to move all the archery damage from a 5 HP hero to Frodo, then cancel all of it (raising threat by 5-- not sure where you are getting the number 7?).  Since the damage is applied all at once, and not resolved point-by-point, Song of Mocking should be able to move the whole thing.\n\n \n\ngot 7 because i was also assuming 2 points of archery asigned to frodo as well as the 5hp hero"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121857-archery-and-frodo/?do=findComment&comment=1261224","commentId":1261224,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1410638647,"content":"ah I see now.  Now I don't know how to answer, could you do all 7?  Since Frodo is limited to doing this once per phase (or round? no time to look it up at the moment), does he receive all 7 as a chunk, or would he first get his own 2 archery damage, followed by a second instance of the 5 damage via Song of Mocking?  No idea.  I would submit that as a rules question."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121857-archery-and-frodo/?do=findComment&comment=1261832","commentId":1261832,"userName":"DaeMord","timestamp":1410695778,"content":"i  must appologise im a bit confused, i was under the impression thats what this forum was for, is there another place i can directly ask a ruling question that i have missed?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121857-archery-and-frodo/?do=findComment&comment=1261857","commentId":1261857,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1410698702,"content":"The forum is mostly for user, even if developper of the game seems to be reading it, they don't answer here.
