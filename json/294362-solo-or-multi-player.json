I've noticed this myself while playing in a group against certain quests. Would it be best to play certain quests in easy mode so you are sure to at least experience the story of a cycle or is each quest (eventually) beatable by a group? Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294362-solo-or-multi-player/?do=findComment&comment=3686194","commentId":3686194,"userName":"Trialus","timestamp":1555980663,"content":"I am a net-decking, true solo, easy mode aficionado, so definitely have a certain bias.  That said, I think every quest in the game (including nightmare versions) has been beaten at every player count and with multiple deck types.  If you want to stick it out and continue to refine your deck and tactics against a specific quest, rest assured that they are all beatable (maybe not a word?).  It really just depends on how much effort/how many attempts you are willing to put into a specific quest and what you are looking to get out of the game...Playing for a challenge?  Keep tweaking and trying again!  Looking for a fun way to experience an adventure in Middle Earth?  Go for easy mode!  Either is legit and fun as long as it lines up with what you want out of the game.\n\n \n\nCheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294362-solo-or-multi-player/?do=findComment&comment=3686309","commentId":3686309,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1555997151,"content":"For our 4 player campaign and for my wife and my cooperative campaigns we always play \"sleazy mode\" where each hero starts with an extra resource but you keep all the encounter cards in.

Some of them are easier with more players (escape from dol guldur, for example, which is very hard in pure solo), and some others are easier when you are alone. Feel free to adjust the difficulty for those quests, if you are not looking for a big challenge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294362-solo-or-multi-player/?do=findComment&comment=3686574","commentId":3686574,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1556030208,"content":"I rarely play any way other than solo, but I will say that even though some quests scale up in difficulty for each player; the player decks also function more powerfully. Since there are more decks, each one can focus better on its specific role (questing, combat, support, etc.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294362-solo-or-multi-player/?do=findComment&comment=3686924","commentId":3686924,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1556057021,"content":"But for few quests which scale in difficulty at higher player count, typically is exactly the opposite.\n\nIn most quest pure solo is more difficult than multiplayer.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294362-solo-or-multi-player/?do=findComment&comment=3687510","commentId":3687510,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1556119379,"content":"In my experience a 4 player game is more difficult than a 2 player game because of location lock and treacheries. An enemy mostly only attacks once, no matter how many players participate, but treacheries like hitting everyone. And only one location can be travelled to in every round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294362-solo-or-multi-player/?do=findComment&comment=3687953","commentId":3687953,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1556143199,"content":"True even if often in 4 players game people can fit in location control cards.
