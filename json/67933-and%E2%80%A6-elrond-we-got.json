Using Erebor Record Keeper to ready your heroes before questing, or Lure of Moria in a Dwarf deck (although 4 resources for 5 cards is a bit costly, in my opnion). It is definitely a risk and reward card. I am really excited to see the rest of the player cards. From the cards we have seen, this might be the best AP in regards to player cards yet."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67933-and%E2%80%A6-elrond-we-got/?do=findComment&comment=662697","commentId":662697,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1343076350,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nleptokurt said:\n\n \n\nBtw, \"Peace, and Thoughtful\" is probably not only the most beautiful, but also the most powerful of the three revealed cards.

This card is not for the early stage of the game in solo session. But later when you have a lot of allies, you can draw lot of cards to finish quest in 1go with POL.But still think this card will shine in coop games.\n\nWhat is more interesting: all this new quite powerful cards(from FOS and SAF) have really low cost. And they are not consider to be secrecy anymore.\n\nMaybe FFG abandon this idea? Cose in my opinion secrecy didn work properly anyway.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67933-and%E2%80%A6-elrond-we-got/?do=findComment&comment=662711","commentId":662711,"userName":"flightmaster101","timestamp":1343081060,"content":" This is going to be a fantastic card for solo play!  I can imagine the possibilities of Elrond, Spirfindel, and Legolas in an elf deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67933-and%E2%80%A6-elrond-we-got/?do=findComment&comment=662733","commentId":662733,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1343086663,"content":"flightmaster101 said:\n\n This is going to be a fantastic card for solo play!  I can imagine the possibilities of Elrond, Spirfindel, and Legolas in an elf deck.\n\n\n\nLooks like all this new player cards perfecty fit solo decks. Make them much more stronger then before.\n\nWith new Glorifindel my new solo deck now can win every quest even Dol-Guldor. Still very hard to win Against Dol-Guldor but possible. I do it twice already.\n\nSo for now solo decks can be completely playable and have same power as a coop decks. Hmmm…. but then if solo decks is going to be so powerful when you combo together 2 powerful solo deck in coop game they will overwhelm any quest!? Maybe my MTG and other card game experience (balance between the cards) play bad joke with me?\n\nBut what i see now is more and more unbalanced way: new players cards now is much more powerful then any new encounter cards.\n\nWith all this new heroes and attachments you can build up now really strong fellowships, reduce your threat quite low and dont really need to face all those strong enemies. But then when i look on the Balrog card  i scary. Will be really difficult to deal with him even with new Glorifindel and Elrond.Sound like we will have a really brutal fight there. And this how is should be in my opinion!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67933-and%E2%80%A6-elrond-we-got/?do=findComment&comment=662976","commentId":662976,"userName":"flightmaster101","timestamp":1343131486,"content":"I don't want to wait until August!   I may have to go into photoshop and pull out the image of Elrond and Vilya and dupe them until the box comes out!"}]}
