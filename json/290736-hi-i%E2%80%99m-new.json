The game has at the very least another cycle to go before the end, and due to its popularity and the other LOTR themed games coming out of FFG, it is unlikely that the game will die soon.\nSo relax and get to know your cards a little. The game isn't the easiest one, but it is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.

But mostly the latter, leading you to pick up your map 80% of the time a place is mentioned.\n\nIn either case, you will decide to visit the website to get an idea of the published materials and...whoa. Now that's a lot of content. Literal years of content. You should expect to get up to date in 2024 or so.\n\nThen comes the deckbuilding options, which at first look massive and hugely varied until you actually start playing and realize that it's much easier than it looks, you just have to put Ã‰owyn with two other heroes and that will be everyting for like three cycles.*\n\nThe community is awesome, especially the blogÂ Tales from the Cards [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com], although that one comes with a perk: the blog's writer Ian Martin takes as much time toÂ publish new stuff as his surnamesake George.\n\nThis game is also responsible for the greatest evil ever created by mankind: Sleeping Sentry. Don't ask what that card does if you value your sanity.\n\nThis game is awesome.\n\n*Although, to be fair, you can literally pick any card in the collection and Seastan will beat The Battle of Carn DÃ»m with it. And a few monts later that card is guaranteed to be nerfed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290736-hi-i%E2%80%99m-new/?do=findComment&comment=3641064","commentId":3641064,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1551900449,"content":"> 30 minutes ago, 987654321 said:\n> \n> Â \n> \n> *Although, to be fair, you can literally pick any card in the collection and Seastan will beat The Battle of Carn DÃ»m with it.

Hands down best game of all time. Apparently the rest of the free world agrees with me and it's a good sign that everything is sold out, because it does reprint, but then immediately gets sold out. This game is a sound game and a great money-maker for FFG. And it's nowhere near dying yet. There is at minimum another cycle in the works but we are waiting on thematically the Shire, Wizard, Mordor to make a few. But they have gone to some pretty crazy and obscure places of the map already and hopefully keep doing so for the rest of our lifetimes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290736-hi-i%E2%80%99m-new/?do=findComment&comment=3642015","commentId":3642015,"userName":"alcuin18","timestamp":1551983298,"content":"Welcome to the best card game out there!\n\nSometimes you do have to wait a bit for reprints. I just got Shadow and Flame (Yay Elrond!) and a couple of others I've been waiting on for awhile but all the content is worth playing. I recommend the saga expansions to start with. Great player cards and you can replay the events of the books."}]}
