Magali's brilliance goes without saying, but I also really like Lure of Moria. The map reflection in the axe blade produces a pretty neat effect. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62286-dunedain-wanderer/?do=findComment&comment=609886","commentId":609886,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1332662820,"content":"the blades probably my favourite so far\n\nsong of earendil's nice- it will make a nice book mark for me\n\nlure for moria, wanderer, elladan, out of the wild are all great\n\ni cant really tell what the end comes is, i can tell that a dwarf is lying dead but its hard to see it, probably just the quality of the picture\n\ni dont particularly like bombur or hail of stones\n\nfrom what ive seen so far i think redhorn has better art....though im going to wait for cardgamedb to get them all up first"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62286-dunedain-wanderer/?do=findComment&comment=609946","commentId":609946,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1332679090,"content":"ps just seen the other pictures - the location cards are very tasty as always...."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62286-dunedain-wanderer/?do=findComment&comment=609965","commentId":609965,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1332682515,"content":"Yeah, locations are in general my favourite. Even if they are nasty I am not that angry to have them reveal when they look so nice.\n\nI really like Lure of Moria. And the Song. Yes, Magali's usually that good.\n\nI am not particularly fond of having bad guys on player cards but I see why on Hail of Stone. It is quite ugly though understandable."}]}
