Then I got the lost realm deluxe, and there were some player cards that get mixed in with the encounter cards (ranger summon). This sent alarm bells ringing as if there was a lot of these types of cards or there was a deluxe that used encounter cards from day the core set I would have to resleeve, something I don't want to do.\n\nAny reason apart from this card not to do this?\n\nThanks for any help"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251932-encounter-cards-in-different-colour-sleeves-question/?do=findComment&comment=2831745","commentId":2831745,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1497180647,"content":"Not a lot of those, though there are a couple more Encounter cards that can be shuffled into your player deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251932-encounter-cards-in-different-colour-sleeves-question/?do=findComment&comment=2831833","commentId":2831833,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1497190685,"content":"Yeah there are not many.  I think that ranger you're referring to is the only one, and maybe one more has been spoiled but not released yet.

In fact I got more problem with loot cards (in hobbit saga for example) that begin in my deck. As far I remember all the encounter effects make you shuffle cards after the set up so you can even use sleeves from your beginning hand.\n\nI do as you do and I also sleeve set-up encounter cards that was never shuffled back in different sleeves so I never have to look at them. Very useful\n\nEdited June 11, 2017 by Rouxxor"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251932-encounter-cards-in-different-colour-sleeves-question/?do=findComment&comment=2832362","commentId":2832362,"userName":"etna666","timestamp":1497219198,"content":"Excellent, thanks very much. Seems like such a small thing, but I've got one of them storage cases (kakapopo) and its full to the brim, thousands of cards.
