They are 1$ per 100 sleeves.\n\nOnce you make your mind on buying more cards, there are some posts in the forums discussing this matter. Use the search function for them.\n\nI keep all the Encounter cards sleeved in the box, and the player cards in binders.\n\nEdited December 31, 2013 by karagh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96029-card-protectors/?do=findComment&comment=941973","commentId":941973,"userName":"DukeWard","timestamp":1388506607,"content":"Thank you for the response.  Have a great day!"}]}
