Only thing I've swapped in the heroes are Dunhere and Eowyn, so it's Eowyn/Gimli/Thalin. When playing the quest, pairing off each of the decks with another (for 6 plays each quest), didn't lose against Passage, 3-3 vs Anduin (and started 3-0 llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] ), 4-2 vs HFG (though these were all painful games, some very close, but don't like this quest much; did better without Northern Trackers than with them for some reason) and currently 4-0 vs CatC which is proving the easiest quest since Passage, Carrock's 7 must be some kind of misprint, it's more like a 2 or 3 in my book."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54489-suggest-a-2-decks-for-2-players-2xcore-hfg-and-catc/?do=findComment&comment=539766","commentId":539766,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1318248183,"content":" Since I am responsible for that mess, I think I can recommend it ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/article/6952879#6952879 [http://boardgamegeek.com/article/6952879#6952879]\n\n \n\nUses two decks with a very different strategy with the intention of synergy (called Hammer & Anvil), maybe this is for you."}]}
