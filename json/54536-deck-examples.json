Problem is I don't really have any idea of how many of each type of card (ally, event, attachment) to include in the deck. Any examples I could get of decks (especially tactic alone or w/another sphere) that seem to work for the three core scenarios would be much appreciated."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54536-deck-examples/?do=findComment&comment=540150","commentId":540150,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1318301571,"content":"To beat the Anduin for instance, try Dunhere with Eowyn and Legolas.

Valiant Sacrifice, Sneak Attack, Snowbourn Scout are good Leadership cards there. And I had before forgot to mention Ancient Mathom perhaps which comes naturally with cards like Ride to Ruin or the Riddermark's Finest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54536-deck-examples/?do=findComment&comment=540457","commentId":540457,"userName":"lkb57","timestamp":1318346992,"content":" The rulebook says that a tournament eligible deck has to have a minimum of 50 cards.

The advantage to a smaller deck is that what you get on a given draw is less random. If you have a 100 card deck and need a Gandalf, your chances are much lower than finding one in a 50 card deck.\n\nIf you aren't worried about making the most uber deck ever, I wouldn't worry too much about deck size. I'd recommend not going TOO large, but no need to always stick to 50 cards exactly."}]}
