With the game nearly at its end until the break is over, nearly all heroes (except 2) are included in this poll to find out who is the most loved by the community in general. \n\nThe poll will go through 2 stages, the first is a Swiss style poll where heroes are matched up randomly against each other every 3 days. This gives them 8 battles each where you can vote for your favourite hero. From these matches, 16 heroes move on to the second stage of the poll, where the 16 places are randomly seeded and the heroes have to compete with each other until only 1 hero remains. That hero will be crowned the Community's Favourite Hero as of 2019. This will be announced at midnight on New Year's Eve (GMT+1). \n\nThe link to the first 8 rounds of Swiss can be found here: https://challonge.com/LOTRLCGHero2019 [https://challonge.com/LOTRLCGHero2019]\n\nSome notes:\n\n- This tournament does not include any Saga hero heroes, meaning that heroes from the Baggins and Fellowship spheres will not be included.\n\n- Some heroes have several versions of themselves. As long as those versions are in different spheres, the hero gets an additional entry. Alt art versions of heroes do not count. This explains why some heroes have their sphere behind their name to identify the different hero cards. \n\n- The bracket will be held in a different poll based on the results of this one. A link to that will follow soon.\n\n- Each hero is unique and has their own place in the game. This is not to determine which heroes are terrible, but which hold the highest in terms of community appreciation.\n\n- If your hero doesn't make the cut, then vote for the next one you like. You are bound to have more than just one hero you like\n\n- If you haven't played with both heroes, you can leave the vote blank.\n\n- In order to vote, you must be signed in on the site, there is no way around this, unfortunately. Signing in will allow you to participate in other future polls like this as well. \n\n- Other comments on different platforms have no influence on the results. Only the pure votes on this site are taken into account when assessing the winners. \n\n \n\nDates:\n\n \n\nFirst round until: Midnight November 26th\n\nSecond round until: Midnight November 29th\n\nThird round until: Midnight December 2nd\n\nFourth round until: Midnight December 5th\n\nFifth round until: Midnight December 8th\n\nSixth round until: Midnight December 11th\n\nSeventh round until: Midnight December 14th\n\nEighth round until: Midnight December 17th\n\n \n\nAfter this, the bracket begins\n\n16->8 until: Midnight December 22nd\n\n8->4 until: Midnight December 26th\n\n4->2 until: Midnight December 29th\n\n2->1 until: Midnight January 1st, 2020\n\n[All dates and times are in GMT+1]\n\n\nYou can follow this thread for updates on the tournament and announcements for the next rounds. I hope this poll will receive as many votes as last year, when we polled the best scenario in the game. \n\n100 heroes go in\n1 goes out\nThis... is the Hero's Tournament 2019"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3834126","commentId":3834126,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1574358059,"content":"Tactic Eowyn will win the tournament!\n\nShe has enough willpower to get through each battle.

I'm also surprised at how big of a lead Lore Denethor has over Elladan. I guess it's because L Denethor is insane in solo? He's always been a bit underwhelming in big games for me. I think people really undervalue leadership Aragorn's Noble trait and easier time equipping Sword that was Broken - not to mention his inborn yet costly flexibility.\n\nFor Spirit Legolas, personally I think that his ability is just too high of a cost. You have to commit a 1 WP character to the quest (forgoing his 3 ranged attack) and discard a card. If I'm gonna discard every turn I'd rather take Arwen, who can pitch to enable fast unexpected courages and who quests for a lot more. I also prefer Lanwyn for a spirit ranged option as she quests better and scales up really nicely in big games where you're more likely to see surges. \n\nOn the other hand Argalad gets to wear Ranger Boots really nicely, enabling a 2 WP quest every turn, and if he readies can contribute an additional \"2 WP\" via his ability or stay ready to contribute ranged later in combat. Every once in a while he pings too which is nice. I think it's just a lot easier for Argalad to unlock more of his stat points with a little work, as he scales up really well with the numerous Lore/elf/character readying effects and uses any attack boosts for good value."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837323","commentId":3837323,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1574775862,"content":"It's important to note that the poll claims this is about *favorite* hero, which isn't necessarily the same thing as \"better\" and *certainly* isn't the same as \"more powerful\".  I voted for Dori over Saruman not because I think he's a stronger hero, but because I like him more.  If we're going to judge by sheer efficiency alone, we might as well not have a tournament and give TaEowyn the prize now.  (Disclaimer -- I've also voted for TaEowyn...)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837409","commentId":3837409,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1574780561,"content":"@dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/] The difference between favorite and better is pretty clear, but do you have separate definitions for \"better\" and \"more powerful\" heroes, too?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837495","commentId":3837495,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1574786526,"content":"Certainly.  The necessary follow-on question to \"which hero is better\" has to be \"better at what?\"  I don't think there'd be any disagreement that Gandalf is a more powerful hero than Theodred.  But is he \"better\"?  Certainly not in a utility role, and Theodred fits comfortably into more decks than Gandalf.  He's a different kind of hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837564","commentId":3837564,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1574789925,"content":"All definitions of \"better\", \"stronger\", \"more powerful \", \"more flexible \" and so on require necessarily the predefinition of a set of criteria to use for the evaluation.  Different people might have different criteria when judging what better or stronger means (solo, multiplayer,  better or stronger at what under which  quest/decks condition.....). \n\nFavorite is very clear: decide who YOU prefer between a given hero choice based on YOUR OWN criteria of choice.  It's a good way to get the feeling of the heroes pool the community prefers. \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837587","commentId":3837587,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1574791222,"content":"And favorites don't depend only on playability, either, but on theme, flavor, and even the artwork of the card!

Personally I much preferred Caldara before the errata, and haven't played her since. I know she's still good, but I no longer find her interesting.\n\nBrand is the lynchpin of the Dale deck, which is still a pretty newly developed archetype along with being interesting and powerful, whereas Boromir is much older, more straightforward, got knocked a bit by the errata (even if he is still really good), etc. Personally I've never understood people's continued love of Tactics Legolas and much prefer Haldan. Halbarad and Eleanor doesn't surprise me that much because I don't think either of them is a hugely popular hero choice. Hirluin does disappoint me, but I guess some people actually like Outlands.\n\nI would ask conversely, how is Spirit Legolas better than Argalad? Because as much as I'm inclined to support Spirit Legolas as something of an underdog hero, there's a lot of reasons why he's an underdog hero, whereas Argalad is a favourite of mine."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3837755","commentId":3837755,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1574803814,"content":"Tactic legolas is, how can i say it?, so TACTIC.\n\nReally, I think tactic legolas is so loved for his capability to put quest progress outside questing phase changing the way to interact with the quest itself.  Plus easy and natural fit with some of the best weapons in the game.

If you include additional side quests, his ability essentially allows you to tech against the scenario. Lots of threat increases? Find Double Back. Lots of minor enemies?

Favorite leaves so much more room for discussion of how fun, thematic, and unique a hero might be, rather than just how likely they are to carry you through a quest. When I pick my favorite and least favorite heroes, I don't really have a clear and consistent system, but there are some patterns that arise. \n\nMy least favorite heroes often have at least one, or a mixture, of these features: \n\n 1. Heroes that encourage ally swarm decks: Bombur, Le Boromir, Caldara, Le Dain, Hirluin, Oin, Ori, Le Thorin\n 2. Heroes with weak or restrictive abilities: Bombur, Caldara, Dori, Dwalin, Elladan, Elrohir, Lo Glorfindel, Mirlonde, Lo Faramir, Fatty, Na'aasiyah, S Pippin, Rossiel, T Theoden\n 3. Heroes that are more suited for single-player: Lo Bilbo, Lo Denethor, Grima\n 4. Heroes that are overpowered in a passive way: Le Dain, S Glorfindel\n 5. Heroes with limited traits: Bard the Bowman, Lo Bilbo, Bombur, Le Dain, Hirluin, Oin, Ori, Dori, Dwalin, Mirlonde, Fatty, Na'aasiyah, S Pippin, Quickbeam, Rossiel, Treebeard\n\nI'm sure you'll notice how totally subjective and inconsistent some of my picks are. I grant you that, but I can explain some of them:\n\n 1. I simply do not enjoy the Dwarf or Gondor ally swarm play-style. Except for a few select quests, I prefer to control under 10 characters.  I've also always disliked it when I have way more allies than there are enemies in the encounter deck. Defending with one character, then attacking with 10 has never felt right to me. Caldara's spirit ally resurrection play-style is far more dynamic and relies on more powerful allies, but I never liked the mono-spirit restriction or how samey her decks felt after a few games. If you hate Outlands, we agree; if you don't, Hirluin is your man! Arguably, Le Brand should be here, and that might be the case once I get tired of Dale ally decks. For the moment, I find arming and readying allies to be more fun than multiplying them. \n 2. Weaker heroes can be fun, but not when they're this limited or bland. Bombur is a thematic triumph, but only exists to support an archtype I've grown to dislike. Dori (I'm sorry Durins_Father) could have had one of my favorite hero abilities if the timing of the action was tweaked or if he worked with allies; I truly love what Dori could have been. Dwalin has poor stats and only works in some quests. Elladan and Elrohir are certainly not weak, but they are a resource hungry package deal that limits deck options. Lo Glorfindel is nearly one of my favorite heroes because of nostalgia, but the only way I enjoy him is when he's being carried by Elrond. Lo Faramir is a hero I want to love but can't; I've run into the wall over and over trying to make him work, and at best he is just fine in certain quests. With all the amazing hobbit heroes, I simply don't have time to bother with Fatty and S Pippin. Na'aasiyah is another hero I want to make work, but I don't enjoy her resource hungry ability. Rossiel isn't incredibly restrictive, but I haven't had the patience for Victory Display shenanigans, and her ability is unreliable in many quests. Caldara, Mirlonde, and T Theoden basically demand mono-sphere decks, which aren't my favorites. \n 3. I nearly always play two player.\n 4. I hate Spirit Glorfindel's design, as I'm sure many people do. It remains one of the strangest balance departures in the entire card-pool. And worst of all, the ability (if you can call it that) is really boring. \n 5. Poor Bard the Bowman is the only Esgaroth character, lacks the useful Dale trait, and occupies a really awkward thematic position since he'd be dead in any timeline well before most of the quests take place. The weak dwarves, hobbits, and silvans aren't weak due to their single traits, but that limitation certainly doesn't help them. Le Dain should be a noble, Dori should be a warrior, Mirlonde should be a ranger or scout, and Rossiel should be a scout. I included Quickbeam and Treebeard here simply because I'm not fond of Ent decks... not much else I can say there. \n\nMy favorite heroes are harder to categorize. Some enable deck types or play-styles that no other hero can match. Some are jack of all trades or fit into nearly any deck. Some encourage getting multiple uses out of them and playing with low character counts. Some are just cool or thematic enough that I can't help but include them in decks. I tend to think of my favorites by sphere: \n\nLEADERSHIP\n\n 1. Sam Gamgee: His stats kick ***, and building them higher is a blast. Innate readying is so much fun, especially when the trigger is engaging an enemy. He is incredible in hobbit decks, but doesn't need to be kept in the Shire. Rangers and Dunedain love him. He comes with a free pony. He's Samwise Gamgee, and he just feels right.\n 2. Elfhelm: I love the way mounts empower heroes, and Elfhelm really gives the archetype a much-needed boost. Part of me wishes he was a Spirit hero, but I still think he's wonderful as is. He certainly isn't among the most powerful heroes, but I always smile when all six of the heroes on the board are mounted up and riding off on a quest. \n 3. Amarthiul: I really dig his combat focused stats and ability. His low health isn't great, but I've found it strangely fun to work around that weakness. His amazing traits, icon flexibility, and resource gain really boost aggressive decks. \n 4. Denethor: I don't use Steward of Gondor, and so I really appreciate heroes that give you an early resource bump. Couple that with low threat, high defense, and resource smoothing and you've got one of the strongest and most versatile backbone heroes in the game.\n 5. Celeborn: Solid stats all around, and an ability that greatly enhances the dynamic Silvan archetype. Whereas I tend to dislike wide boards with lots of static allies, I love the guerrilla play style of Silvan decks. \n\n\nLORE\n\n 1. Aragorn: I love to run with a high starting threat, and bringing Aragorn is one of the best ways to enable that. Even better, he comes with great stats, traits, toys, and sentinel. This will always be my favorite Aragorn, and among my all time favorite heroes. \n 2. Erestor: Created an entirely unique deck-type that is a joy to play. \n 3. Pippin: Like with Sam, its such a great feeling to be rewarded for engaging an enemy... for being brave. Pippin is probably even more splashable than Sam, and he brings you almost everything you could want from Lore: card draw, enemy management, willpower, hobbit tech, and low threat. The gap between this version and the other is the widest in the entire game.\n 4. Haldir: Killing a ravenous warg with a terrible shadow card before it has a chance to strike remains one of my greatest joys in this game. Ranged characters are great in general, but Haldir is a true sniper. \n 5. Thurindir: Sidequests have added such a cool new dimension to the game, and Thurindir makes them a reliable part of your deck. Couple that with low threat, efficient stats, and great traits. The only reason I don't put him higher is that side-quests don't work well with many older scenarios and also clash with some of the newer ones. \n 6. Honorable mention to Damrod, Folco, Bifur, Haldan, Elrond. These guys might cycle into my favorites list from time to time. \n\nSPIRIT\n\n 1. Cirdan: I believe he's my favorite hero in the entire game, and certainly my favorite spirit hero... which I never would have guessed. Amazing stats and traits. An ability that essentially thins your deck, and with a drawback that's easy to turn into a benefit. I love running unique cards, but hate when they clog up my hand. With Cirdan around, that rarely happens. He fits into many decks, and sings in a Noldor deck. But most importantly, he can use Narya, and unlike Gandalf, Cirdan has no ally version to compete with. His greatest flaw is that he doesn't have a full-art alternate card yet. \n 2. Idraen: I feel insane putting Idraen higher than Arwen or Galadriel, but I'm really fond of heroes with innate readying that triggers reliably. I also love her stats, her art, and her general vibe. I don't think she's particularly powerful, but she was in a ton of my favorite decks and beat some of my favorite quests. I'm also biased towards all the FFG original Dunedain heroes because they, like Aragorn, fit so well into every scenario. \n 3. Arwen: No argument to make here. She's amazing and efficient. Gorgeous art and solid theme. \n 4. Galadriel: While I don't love having to rely on Nenya to make Galadriel truly shine, the truth is that she's fine without it. Her ability is just so insanely good that she doesn't even need to have willpower to justify her inclusion. \n 5. Undecided between Dain, Eowyn, Frodo, and Theoden: I really dislike about one half the Spirit heroes, and really like the other half. The sphere contains my favorite and least favorite heroes in the game. Dain is the type of dwarf hero I love, because he incorporates dwarf archetypes without demanding to be in a dwarf deck. Eowyn has been solid forever, but the shine is off her a bit since her Tactics version arrived. Frodo has such a unique and useful ability, and his art is among my all time favorites. Santa Theoden empowers my beloved but oft struggling Rohirrim. \n\nTACTICS\n\n 1. Mablung: As with Sam and Pippin, I really get a kick out of being rewarded for engaging enemies. Mablung is a resource making machine. It's not terribly hard to get 3-4 resources out of his ability per round, but even 1 is great. Well rounded stats and good traits let Mablung fill in as needed. He's useful in anything from mono-tactics to tri-sphere. As long as you find a way to draw cards, Mablung will make sure you can pay for them. If only he was an honorary Dunedain... \n 2. Beorn: The big bear is such an unusual and restrictive hero. Playing with him feels akin to running a contract that buffs one hero immensely, but blanks them. The key to Beorn is figuring out the right tempo to use him. Will you engage everyone you can as early as possible and let them stab at the bear until he's down to one hitpoint? Will you only defend the weakest enemies, and rely on attack reduction and shadow control to keep Beorn in tiptop shape? Even though he is an incredibly restrictive hero in many ways, I've found myself putting Beorn in all sorts of decks. He's risky but exhilarating. \n 3. Aragorn: With Mablung at number 1, it's no wonder that Aragorn is along for the ride. I like engaging enemies, and I like doing it during unusual windows. Add in the defense reduction and you've got a premium killer on your hands. I still prefer Lore Aragorn, but they did such a good job making each version feel unique while still portraying some key aspect of the character. \n 4. Legolas: Like Tactics Aragorn's engagement timing, I love Legolas' ability to clear the active location or advance the quest at unusual times. There really is no hero like him. For such an efficient and reliable killer, Legolas is a deceptively weird and dynamic card. And that art is among my favorite depictions of Legolas. \n 5. Undecided between Beregond, Boromir, and Eowyn. Beregond is a tank, Boromir is a machine, and Eowyn is a god. All very powerful and fun, but somehow not higher at this moment. Ask me tomorrow and I'll have changed my mind. \n\n\nGANDALF\n\n 1. Gandalf: Because of everything about him. The only knocks against him are his amazing allies, his hunger for deck space, and that he might be overly strong in some cases. \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3838909","commentId":3838909,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1574952699,"content":"What do you guys think?

Too me obviously the weaker heroes don't get played as much because this game is pretty hard and you need right deck-building most times. But also what people value as their favorite could also be connected to their favorite heroes or playstyle. Example I was never much into Radagast and the hobbit movies didn't help but I love Eagles and he makes them amazing. So he jumped onto my favorites list. On that list is Legolas and Boromir because of the books/movies and even if their cards aren't as good (Le Boromir and Sp Legolas) I still like all their hero versions more than the standard power characters. Like not being a Dwarf fan I don't care about any of their characters even though many are quite powerful. So to me power is related to favorite but it's definitely secondary to how much I enjoy the playstyle they are creating or the lore of the character."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3839063","commentId":3839063,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1574967868,"content":"> 4 hours ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> What do you guys think? How strong of a correlation is there between your favorite heroes, and the most powerful ones?\n\nThere's definitely some correlation for me, but not direct causation. My favourite heroes tend to be based on how fun they are to play and how interesting their abilities are to play with or build around - interesting abilities often enable more options, and with the breadth of the card pool at this point more options often translates to more power; and using more powerful heroes often makes it easier to do interesting and fun things, so I like those heroes perhaps less for themselves but more for the kind of things they can enable.\n\nBut then less powerful heroes also sometimes have interesting and fun abilities, so my favourites can be spread across the spectrum of power (of course this also helps my view of those heroes who are just straightforwardly powerful and help to enable these fun strategies)\n\nEdited November 28, 2019 by PocketWraith"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3839070","commentId":3839070,"userName":"Will Anderson","timestamp":1574968283,"content":"Part of it has to do with how many games I've played (dear god, so many...) and the size of my card pool.

At the same time, I got tired of some of the old stalwarts, whose effects - as has been mentioned - are often passive and not particularly interesting.

Balin at least has 4 hit points to go with his 2 def, meaning he can survive a medium sized enemy in a pinch, which isn't useless.\n\nI wonder if they're bigger problem is that they don't have much direct/specialized synergy with popular contemporary archetypes. Both are great utility heroes, but only synergize specifically with dwarf swarm or attachment decks, neither of which are hugely popular (and have arguably better hero choices).

Unfortunately, they each have only the Dwarf trait, which limits them outside of dedicated dwarf decks in which they're competing with the vast gaggle of tribal-Dwarf heroes. They're great splash heroes and fantastic with 2+ players. Bifur is also one of only 5 heroes whose stat total is less than their printed threat, and he's the only hero who's under-costed without a clear catch: Beorn is immune to player cards, S Glorfindel raises threat and guilt levels, Na'asiyah cannot pay for allies, and Smeagol will likely turn on you. T Eowyn effectively has him beat there, but she's arguably the best hero in the entire game so that's not really a knock on Bifur. Elladan and Elrohir are sort of under-costed when played together, but that's a big restriction. Mirlonde is effectively under-costed, but then her ability is essentially blank if she's the only Lore hero. If Bifur was made today, would he be 8 threat? Or is his resource-smoothing ability considered a step below the traditional power curve, thus justifying the -1 to his threat cost? I suppose the argument might be that his ability doesn't actually gain you anything measurable: no stats, resources, readying, or knowledge has actually been gained because you paid a resource for another resource. \n\nGrima,  Elrond, Lo Bilbo, T Bilbo, T Beregond, S Beregond, Galadriel, Hirluin, S Theoden, T Theoden, Folco, and T Merry are all heroes with inflated printed threat. Folco, T Merry, and T Theoden essentially begin the game on par or better. Hirluin is expected to ramp up so quickly from passive ally boosts that his starting threat is anything but too high. So really we're left with Grima, Elrond, Lo Bilbo, T Bilbo, T Beregond, Galadriel, and S Theoden as the actual inflated threat heroes. Grima, T Beregond, and S Theoden are all heroes that reduce the cost of cards, and that might be considered an ability strong enough to justify an extra +1 to threat cost. Though I'd argue that it doesn't in S Theoden's case, and that he inherited his inflated threat from his Tactics version, which is exactly what happened to S Beregond. And why doesn't Damrod get a +1 to threat cost? Is it because he's less likely to play a trap every turn than S Theoden is to play a Rohan ally? Elrond's healing and Galadriel's abilities are definitly powerful enough to justify their threat cost. Poor Bilbo is just a bizarre design, but drawing an extra card in solo is quite powerful and I can almost understand what they were going for.

Theoden in particular would be much more playable with a threat of 11.\n\nLet's be' honest: merry at 6 is robbery. With hobbits fellows he gets 3 attack plus a strong repeatable ability equating to 2 threat less than his actual stats plus ability to ready another character in combact phase... 4 attack in sagas when frodo is in play.\n\nWithout hobbits he is still 2 wp for 6 threat in tactic.  By far the best and cheaper quester in sphere until eowyn arrived. Merry is very good with 6 threat and would be unfairly good at 5.\n\nTheoden is clearly better when the count of questing tactics heroes rise, especially in multiplayer OR as centerpiece of a voltron deck. As stand alone tactic  questing hero he is just too expensive to be considered good. \n\nLore Bilbo on the other hand is just overpriced  and more so with an extended carpool. The ability is strong  in solo, good in two players, nice or meh in 3 or 4 players  depending from your personal feeling.  Even in the early time of the game the ability was not enough to cover a gap of 3 treath vs his actual stats. Also the stat distribution is not great and has worsened during the game maturity.  His lore version was at the center of one killer deck in early game along with fast hitch, a burning brand and love of tales but outside that....\n\nTactic bilbo is better having actual stats better than his printed one and compensating for the most the threat gap plus a sinergizing ability which can be quite good in quite a few decks. At least this version has 2 abilities which make sense,  synergize between themselves and provide something that is not so easy to come by even with the modern carpool \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3842545","commentId":3842545,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1575486150,"content":"I always thought that Lore Bilbo had three extra threat as he drew you one card compared to Beravor's two cards and six extra threat, because you will most likely use her for her ability and all her stats are wasted.

I wouldn't mind exhausting Bilbo for draw as much as I mind exhausting Beravor. And Beravor is a far better third hero in a solo deck than Bilbo. As it stands, I will nearly always prefer to play Beravor over Bilbo because she draws more cards, incentivizes readying, and selects who draws the cards. If Bilbo was 7 threat or 9 threat with high willpower, or even 1 higher attack, I'd like him. I'm not really sure what it is about Bilbo that made them think low willpower, low attack, and decent defense. I suppose it's thematically Old Bilbo, but even then Bilbo was a cheeky senior planning to escape to Rivendell. Doesn't seem right that he has the same willpower as homebodies like Fatty and Tom Cotton. \n\nEdited December 4, 2019 by pmdoug"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3842611","commentId":3842611,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1575490741,"content":"Beaver is a great hero choice, even better now with more readying options and far less need of her stats because of allies power creep vs base game.\n\nWith 2 resource cost you can pay for a 2w or attack rally with ease even in-sphere. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3842658","commentId":3842658,"userName":"pmdoug","timestamp":1575494405,"content":"> 56 minutes ago, Halberto said:\n> \n> Beaver is a great hero choice, even better now with more readying options and far less need of her stats because of allies power creep vs base game.\n> \n> With 2 resource cost you can pay for a 2w or attack rally with ease even in-sphere. \n\nWell, I must call her Beaver from now on. \n\nI will always have a fondness for her because the friend I play with would always run her in the early days and I would leech that card draw with my 0 draw leadership decks. \n\nBeravor offers choices and options, while Bilbo is just a solid passive on a terrible body. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3842663","commentId":3842663,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1575494954,"content":"Round 4 is over, the poll is now on round 5 until the 8th of December. \n\nQuickbeam vs Smeagol was close by 1 vote in the favor of Quickbeam\nSpirit Frodo beat Leadership Frodo\nBeorn was surpassed by his son Grimbeorn in the Beorning cagematch.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3842838","commentId":3842838,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1575510711,"content":"Blasted elves are dominating the standings, with 6 of the top 10 spots.\n\nEdited December 5, 2019 by Kjeld"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3842936","commentId":3842936,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1575527950,"content":"> 4 hours ago, Kjeld said:\n> \n> Blasted elves are dominating the standings, with 6 of the top 10 spots.\n\nWell they are the firstborn children of Iluvatar so there's that hahaha.\n\nAlso some thoughts from this round, Firstly LOL at Bombur V.S.

It's the most essential stat, and having 1 hero that can reliably quest for 3+ is so useful. \n\n4 with 4 wp, 5 with 3 wp, 3 with 2 wp, 2 with 1 wp, and 2 with 0 wp. \n\nThe only 2 (?) heroes with 0 wp made the top 16, but that's because they're amazing defenders. Being able to defend early is a huge boon. \n\nThe only dedicated attacker to make the top 16 is Haldir, unless you count Lo Aragorn or Grimbeorn. This makes sense since loading up attack power on one character is rarely as essential as it is with willpower and defense. Heroes like Haldir and Grimbeorn can use high attack power in ways that other attackers can't, and that makes them very powerful. However, there are a bunch of great attackers just outside the top 16 to counter this argument. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3850274","commentId":3850274,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1576535202,"content":"Thanks for the analyses guys, fun to read those break downs.

T Beregond also makes items like Spear of the Citadel and Raven-winged Helm easier to play. I enjoy direct damage decks, and T Beregond aids those. I'm sure there are cool combos to use with S Beregond, but I've likely missed them because I haven't used him much. My love of S Dain might also contribute to my ambivalence towards S Beregond, as does S Beregond's so-so art. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302570-2019-heros-tournament/?do=findComment&comment=3854784","commentId":3854784,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1577106027,"content":"I've been a little late, but the first set of finals matches has now been completed.

You have the two courageous mortals (Eowyn and Sam) who boast high willpower, low threat, and action advantage. Then you have two of the most canonically powerful beings in Middle Earth (Gandalf and Galadriel), who offer abilities seen no where else in the card pool, and who come with their own artifacts.
