Or possibly subtract some? and likely subtract when doing scenario 3 at all?\n\nFor example if you did just the modifier for scenario 3 4-player done in 5 rounds, you'd get (5-5+4-7)=-3x10= -30.

For each extra round you'd add 10 points (or 5 or whatever would feel most fit). I believe there should be penalty for stalling, or bonus for swiftness. And it does take less time the more player play, naturally. The given difference is only 1 round though. For level 7 the non-bonus number of rounds would be 11 for solo, 10 for a couple and so on. Well, it is just an idea since the original idea of counting score as given in the rulebook is not working very well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47710-wild-idea-for-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=479104","commentId":479104,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1307023900,"content":"Ileopsoas said:\n\nI think the numb. of players shouldn't affect the score, since you compare it to games played with the same number of players!I think we should keep only the number of rounds in the score (it is useless to compare two different scenarios as well...)\n\n\n\nI needed the number of players and level to find the \"appropriate\" number of rounds in which the scenario should be done.

Wandering Took is removed from the story and you web Theodred. You have 12 willpower against 4 threat strength which gives you 8 progress and completes the first stage of the quest. \n\nYou travel to the Old Forest Road and ready Aragorn. Then the Spirit/Tactics player optionally engages the Black Forest Bats and then plays Quick Strike to kill it with Legolas which gains 2 progress and completes the second stage of the quest. \n\nDon't Leave the Path is revealed and Ungoliant's Spawn and another Forest Spider is revealed. The Spirit/Tactics character gives control of the Wandering Took to the Leadership player and then engagement checks begin. The Leadership player gets all three Spiders because of their new threat of 32. The Snowbourn Scout defends against the Spawn and the two Forest Spiders are left undefended dealing 3 damage to both Theodred and Gloin. Then the Leadership player plays Sneak Attack to bring Gandalf into play which deals 4 damage to the Spawn.
