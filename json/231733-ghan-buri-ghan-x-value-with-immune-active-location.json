Deck 1 had Faramir (leadership), Gimli, and Mablung. Deck 2 had Damrod, Haldir, and Pippin (lore). For Frodo Fellowship hero, I used the one where spending 1 of his resources gives him +2 WP and +2 Attack.\n\n \n\nIt took a lot of deck tweaking, but next time I won't be so determined -- I just made it a personal challenge this first time around to have no enemies escape as I found the quest really fun and creative."}]}
