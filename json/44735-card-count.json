Not getting cards is bad, but you do not automatically lose.\n\n\nSecond, you only need to pad your deck if you are likely to go through all of it. In a deck that doesn't draw additional cards, you would have to play 40+ turns to exhaust a 50 card card deck. I feel confident saying that most games won't go on anywhere near that long. Remember, at that time you would also have around 70 threat, even if you never gained threat from anything but your turn ending. It is possible (though, I think, unlikely) that a deck with a ton of card drawing might want to run with more than 50 cards, but we won't know that until we see the game. Even in such a scenario, you would probably be better off incorporating the Will card that allows you to reshuffle your discards into your deck, rather than playing with an oversized monstrosity of deck.\n\n\nIn general, you want to make a deck with as close to the minimum number of cards as possible, because that gives you the best chance of drawing your strongest cards. By keeping to fifty cards, you decrease the effects of random draws, and let you focus your deck on whatever it happens to be good at.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44735-card-count/?do=findComment&comment=448414","commentId":448414,"userName":"DrNate","timestamp":1301856950,"content":" Which sphere is the card that lets you reshuffle your discards into your deck?
