For Grimbeorn, the cost (everything before the word \"to\" in his Response) includes the step of declaring him as the attacker.Â  You, as a player, do not have a window in which you can declare attackers. The card effect does this for you.\n\nSame goes for Quick Strike.\n\nNote the difference with the Ambush trap: \"Combat Action: The engaged player discards Ambush to declare an attack against the attached enemy.\"Â  There is no language which declares an attacker for you. You do that step yourself, and can choose 1 or more attacks as you wish.\n\nEdited June 28, 2019 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293547-rule-clarification-on-new-grimbeorn-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3730465","commentId":3730465,"userName":"David&amp;Anna","timestamp":1561739003,"content":"Thanks.

One character is exhausted to pay for the cost of Quick Strike, and the effect is that the exhausted character is immediately declared as an attacker against the target enemy. The card's resolution does not allow for a standard declaration step in which other characters can declare.\n\n\n\nAs a practical matter, this seems to essentially mean that you are inserted intoÂ Player Attack Resolution at the action window after 6.8.1.\n\nFor reference, Grimbeorn's text:\n\n\n\n> Response:Â After Grimbeorn the Old defends an attack, spend 1 resource from his pool to declare him as an attacker against that enemy (and resolve his attack). The defending enemy gets -2[defense]Â for this attack.Â \n\n\n\nAnd Quick Strike:\n\n\n\n> Action: Exhaust a character you control to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against any eligible enemy target.\n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293547-rule-clarification-on-new-grimbeorn-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3730538","commentId":3730538,"userName":"David&amp;Anna","timestamp":1561745115,"content":"Thank you for this clarification...darn it!
