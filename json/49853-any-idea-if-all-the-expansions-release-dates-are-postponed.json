Will FFG stick to their schedule with one pack each month and adjust the release dates or do you think they will stick to the original plan and publish the first couple of expansion packs at the same time?\n\nI'm asking bc the German publisher has an upcoming product time table where it says:\n\nhttp://www.heidelbaer.de/produktplan/ [http://www.heidelbaer.de/produktplan/]\n\nHunt for Gollum: July\n\nCarock: August\n\nRhosgobel: August\n\nEmyn Muil: September\n\nDead Marshes: September\n\nDon't really know if you can take this info for valid though (The dates were adjusted on their site late May). If you go to the specific pages of the expansions they repeat the release dates above and claim that these are the same for the English versions (even though the text says \"monthly expansion\")\n\nExample for Rhosgobel expansion:\n\nhttp://www.heidelbaer.de/einzelansicht-spiel/spiel/der_herr_der_ringe_lcg_die_reise_nach_rhosgobel/ [http://www.heidelbaer.de/einzelansicht-spiel/spiel/der_herr_der_ringe_lcg_die_reise_nach_rhosgobel/]\n\nAny info from the other European publishers on this matter?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49853-any-idea-if-all-the-expansions-release-dates-are-postponed/?do=findComment&comment=498851","commentId":498851,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1310486923,"content":"That release schedule seems nice.

We are not allowed to release anything before Fantasy Flight Games does. Most of the time we cannot give exact predictions of release dates because we are dependend on the info FFG gives us and sometimes they tend to delay those infos to us. As all the cards (English/German) are typically produced together and have roughly the same shipping time, we are usually able to match the US release dates. On rare occasions the German cards arrive a few days later.\"\n\nActually that means, regardless what the European publishers say concerning release dates, it means nothing. FFG sets the dates and when they release, all others may release."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49853-any-idea-if-all-the-expansions-release-dates-are-postponed/?do=findComment&comment=499225","commentId":499225,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1310557334,"content":"The only thing that l would be surprised about with the once per month thing is that I would imagine they would try to release the first Big Box expansion in time for Christmas. But even if they could double up just for one month, they could make that happen. All of this is purely speculative, of course. But I think that makes some amount of sense."}]}
