Was my first try at Journey Down the Auduin. I played sneak attack during the resource phase placing Gandalf in play and inflicting 4 damage on the Hill Troll. Then Gandalf comes back to my hand at the end of the resouce phase. Then I immediately put him into play as an ally for the planning phase inflicting another 4 damge?\n\n \n\nThanks,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182728-sneak-attack-gandalf-question/?do=findComment&comment=1695736","commentId":1695736,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1437168569,"content":"Yes, that is a legal play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182728-sneak-attack-gandalf-question/?do=findComment&comment=1695851","commentId":1695851,"userName":"Dsbessie","timestamp":1437176906,"content":"Thanks for the quick response.
