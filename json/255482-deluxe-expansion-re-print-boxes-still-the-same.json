The problem I have with the normal deluxe boxes is that the \"canvased\" surface is very delicate and will scrap off very easily, which makes it hard to convert the boxes into something else. The new boxes have regular semi-glossy texture which will not scrape off, and on top of that are thinner so it's easier to cut them up and do something with them."}]}
