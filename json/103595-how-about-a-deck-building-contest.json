But then to be fair we'd need just one person to play all the decks, which would need to be someone who has way too much time on his hands. Does someone like that exist here? I know most people on these forums seem to have a lot more time than I do to play, but not necessarily enough to test several decks on several quests in a short span of time.\n\n \n\nEven then, the person who plays might not understand the way the deck is designed to be played and can bring down a good deck... so in order to fix that, we'd have to have 2-3 players who each test every deck and then get an average between them. Finding 3 people with way too much time on their hands would be even harder.\n\n \n\nMaybe we should just stick to voting :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103595-how-about-a-deck-building-contest/?do=findComment&comment=1045710","commentId":1045710,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1397201619,"content":"> I would say that instead of just voting, we should determine a set of quests to play and judge by score and/or win/loss ratio.

That way you can have different categories worth 0-10 points that add up to a final score. For instance,\n\n * Theme: how true to the contest theme was the deck?\n * Creativity: did the entrant come up with a fresh way of representing the theme?\n * Playability: how did the deck handle playing through the scenario/scenarios?\n\nThe playability could be objective (rank all entries based on self-reported completion of Anduin, or some other quest/quests), and then the other categories could be voted on.\n\n \n\nIf my suggestion is too similar to the other contest thread that's active right now, you can ignore me.\n\nEdited April 11, 2014 by entMoot"}]}
