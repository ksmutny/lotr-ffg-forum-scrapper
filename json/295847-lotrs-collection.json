Wilds of Rhovanion is one of the better cycles in the whole game, and Sands of Harad's player cards really round out a lot of the \"not quite there yet\" deck archetypes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295847-lotrs-collection/?do=findComment&comment=3712190","commentId":3712190,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1559320754,"content":"At first I was lukewarm for Haradrim but have since come around. At least get The Mumakil for those amazing allies. The Wilds of Rhovanion is also an amazing box. The Dale archetype is super fun and plays surprisingly well with a very small card pool.
