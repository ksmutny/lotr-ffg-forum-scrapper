(or at least the leadership cards as there are WAY MORE than I initially thought!)\n\nI'm actually planning to do something sort of similar soon but rather than changing existing cards I'm going to make a bunch of new custom ones to try and improve upon existing traits and provide cards to fix what I see as weaknesses for certain traits or deck types (especially the warrior trait).\nReally love the custom cards you make, they could really breathe new life into some next to useless older cards. I just wish that FFG legitimately made some of these cards like this originally because I am too much of a stickler for the rules to actually use custom cards during games. I still really enjoy reading them and thinking about how much better/more fun they would be to play with  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] \n \n\nLeadership:\n-Rear Guard. Hmmm I really like the new effect and design on Rear Guard but you could use 2 or 3 copies in one turn and simply discard allies like Squire of the Citadel to give all heroes across the board +2 or +3 to all stats. It can also be recycled with the leadership Tome for a total of six uses. Maybe limit once per round? I do like that the doomed 1 provides an extra \"cost\" to use the card though. Also just till end of phase limits abuse.. hmm maybe it isn't necessary to limit it to once per round. Also perhaps it should at least be an ally that is controlled by the player playing the card rather than any ally in play to make it at least a little more restrictive/less awesome. It combos insanely well with the various allies that leave play at the end of the round anyway because you can quest with them then after the quest phase (when they are more or less useless unless you can ready them) you can discard them pre-emptively to boost your heroes combat capability. Gives more use to Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf allies.\n\n-Son of Arnor is great. I like that it now combos with other \"surprise\" cards (cards that care about enemy engagement vs your own threat). \n-Longbeard Orc Slayer. I actually prefer this card as 1 damage to all orc enemies in play. I know that it is restrictive and does nothing in quests that don't have orc enemies but he is called Longbeard Orc Slayer so to me it is unthematic if he damages any type of enemy. That being said your design definitely makes him a much more viable card for all quests rather than just ones that include orc enemies. I like that you gave him a point of willpower as well. For four cost even with his ability he should be able to quest for at least 1. \n-Steward of Gondor. I am in what I believe is the small majority that has absolutely no issue whatsoever with Steward of Gondor and don't think it needs any errata or changes whatsoever. The only single change I would make to Steward is changing the title of the card and it no longer providing the Gondor trait. It should be called something completely different (yet still being unique) so that it isn't a massive thematic fail placing it on anyone but Denethor. It should be a card that makes sense on pretty much any hero considering it is used on such a wide range of heroes by players of the game. \n\n-Taking Initiative is a fantastic card and I wouldn't change anything. If this is how the actual card operated it would almost be auto include in any ranger decks that use leadership in my opinion. \n\n-Keen Eyed Took is fantastic. Works great with the \"surprise\"mechanic and is no longer useless. I like the 1 point of attack you added as well. \n\n-Dawn take you all. Hmmm I would have liked a change to this card that helped it from doing nothing so often. I hate that this card can so easily fail and cancel nothing at all especially at 2 cost. Making it only cost 1 and adding doomed 1 instead definitely makes it more viable considering even if it does fail at least it only costs 1 instead of 2. The valour effect also helps with viability as it allows it to discard far more shadow cards at once which means it has a much better chance of actually cancelling some nasty shadow effects. I think that overall the redesign for this card is actually really good and makes it a much better card and far more viable but for some reason I am still not a fan of the card. Perhaps I just don't like the idea of paying resources to blindly discard shadow cards. I would rather shadow cancellation or cards that allow me to discard shadow cards regularly without paying each time like Armoured Destrier etc.\n\n-Sword that was broken. Hmmmm I don't think anything is wrong with the original card unlike many of the other cards you have reworked (which desperately need an update/boost) but I do really like your version. I like that it gives the resource match for anyone not just Aragorn. I like that it requires the attached hero to be questing to give the boost as well as just getting the boost no matter what is pretty **** powerful. It is also a nice counterpoint against the fact it now provides a resource icon to any Dunedain hero not just Aragorn. I hate the restricted slot though.... I am strongly against adding restricted to pretty much any card as I think enough cards already have restricted on them as is and making more attachments restricted only limits deckbuilding even more. Other than restricted really love this redesign. Oh actually one other thing... I do think it needs to do something only if the attached hero is Aragorn as thematically it really is supposed to go on him. Perhaps like Snowmane it can lose the restricted keyword if attached to Aragorn? I would add that but keep everything else the same or I would just remove restricted altogether. Haha I recognised that symbol for Innistrad (the cool curved V shape) straight away in the art even though I haven't played magic for years.\n\n-Sneak attack. I like this redesign as well but it might be too good with Gandalf. I really like that it makes Sneak attack actually worthwhile in conjunction with other allies considering as of now it is only really good with a select few allies. This change would make it a decent card when used with just about any ally thanks to the boost they receive. I really like this change but it would make Sneak attack + Gandalf just way too good. Other than that very simple but very cool redesign. \n\n-Fresh Tracks is great. Very small change but a great one. Rather than using the ability to not engage the enemy you can instead choose to engage the enemy optionally and it helps trigger \"surprise\" mechanics and abilities.\n\n-We are not Idle is fairly different from the original. I like that you put a limit on it and a cost of 1 as well. You now need to exhaust at least 2 Dwarf characters to get a boost which in dwarf swarm decks really isn't hard or much of a setback. I've never run or used dwarf decks before so I can't really judge this card accurately but it seems as though you have made the card a lot less overpowered and a bit more reasonable. \n\n-Brok Ironfist. This redesign is one of my favourites. Well costed decent ally that is a fair bit cheaper when a dwarf character is destroyed and is free if a dwarf character is destroyed while you are in valour. Well costed, cool ability that makes sense. Everything that the original should have been! Also he is unique so you can't put more than one into play cheaply or for free anyway. \n\n-Dunedain Wanderer. As far as I can see you just upped the willpower to 2. Even though its such a minor change it is a good one. For 5 cost he should be 2/2/2 (there are plenty of 2/2/2 characters that are 4 cost) and even at only 2 cost in secrecy he is just that tiny bit better. I still would not use this card outside secrecy (3 or 4 resources is sort of my limit for ally cost and if im using an ally that costs more than 3 or 4 they better have one hell of an awesome or unique ability!) but it is definitely a bit more viable outside of secrecy now and far better with secrecy. \n-Common Cause is cool and still costs 1 but overall performs fairly differently. You need to trigger it now as you exhaust the original character. This means it is a little more restrictive as to when you can use it however you don't have to exhaust a hero to use the card anymore and instead just use it AS you exhaust a hero to use them for something else. I like this because you aren't just swapping one hero for another you are getting an additional action out of this card (rather than swapping who can perform an action) which honestly is better considering you are using up a card and a resource to do so. Bit more bang for your buck. It is very cheap readying however so that extra card on top might be a bit too good. Then again something like Descendants of Kings only costs 1 leadership resource and that can ready several characters and is almost always going to ready at least one or two so the card draw on top is probably spot on. Just the readying effect probably wouldn't be enough to justify using this card over lots of other cheaper readying effects. \n\n-Celebrians Stone. I like the redesign on this one but again I think it needs to have some effect that only triggers if it is attached to Aragorn as he is the intended receipient. Because it now gives the resource icon to any Dunedain hero perhaps it could only give +1 willpower but +2 if attached to Aragorn? I really like the discard effect if you have any copy. Really clever and cool mechanic for multiple copies of unique cards. Certain unique allies should have similar mechanics so that extra copies can still be used for something other than discard fodder/backup incase the ally dies. \n\n-Silverlode Archer. Fits in far more nicely with the Silvan mechanics and deck type now. Still an expensive ally for the stats so the ability makes sense and doesn't seem overpowered. \n-Guard of the Citadel. Hmmmmm does this guy need to cost 3 now? 3 defence and 2 hitpoints whilst ALSO still having a point of willpower and a point of attack is one HELL of a bargain for 2 resources. I know that he will only have 3 def in a deck using three Gondor Heroes but that is obviously the deck you are going to use him in. We do have lots of other decent defensive allies for 2 cost but they usually only have 1 hitpoint or have zero will or attack as well. He can also receive several boosts being a Gondor character so could easily be 2/2/3/2 with Visionary Leadership and Boromir leadership. Really can't decide if I think he should cost 3 now or should still cost 2 but heavily leaning towards 3 as he is just too good at only 2 cost in any dedicated Gondor deck. \n-For Gondor. Another very simple but great redesign. Made no sense that the old card boosted all characters attack and only boosted Gondor characters defence. This is better thematically and mechanically. \n\n-Dunedain Watcher. I have included this ally in my decks lots of times and every single time.... it is to have more shadow cancellation and control. Never is she included for any other reason... I like that you give her an additional point of willpower making her actually useful for something other than her ability. Even just that single point of willpower I think is more than enough to make her a much more viable and useful card. The extra ability can only be used when in valour though so definitely doesn't make her too good or anything. It is just a feint effect and you do still have to discard her so I actually quite like the additional ability as well. If this card was actually designed like this the first thing I would be doing tonight is including 3 copies in my decks! The actual version of the card I just cannot bring myself to use anymore ESPECIALLY with the addition of new shadow control cards like Armoured Destrier and whatnot that are just so much better. \n\n-Ever Vigilant. With so many more readying effects and cards these days a card like this is next to useless. It is still worth using in conjunction with high cost powerful allies that have good all round stats or with for example Ents but overall unless it is being used in a specific way is pretty bad and doesn't compare to many other options we have these days. Hell you can trigger this effect once per turn (or more depending!) with Leadership Faramir hero for free! This new version costs zero which I think is fitting and replaces itself (by drawing a card) if the targeted ally shares a trait with each of your heroes. Still not the best card ever but definitely a far more valuable and affordable effect with the redesign. \n\n-Grave Cairn. Love that it just provides +3 across the board and costs zero. Pretty much the leadership version of Unseen Strike but instead of needing to have a lower threat than the enemies engagement you need a character to have been destroyed or discarded that turn. A much better and much more viable version. May be a little too strong with Eomer though as for one resource and one ally death he goes from 3 attack to a whopping 8 for one resource. \n\n-Valiant Sacrifice. Just like your redesign of Grave Cairn is almost like a leadership version of Unseen Strike with a different trigger this is like the leadership version of Foe Hammer! Instead of destroying an enemy with a hero that has a weapon attachment you need an ally to be destroyed or discard and only draw 2 instead of 3 if the ally was not unique. I really like this redesign as well although 3 cards for 0 cost even if you are losing a unique character at the same time is pretty **** good. The fact that the loss of the ally is not because of this card and just an additional cost I think this might be a bit too strong at 0 cost.\n\nPerhaps it should still cost 1 but should still have the extra card drawn for unique characters. I think I prefer it costing 0 but it might just be too strong. If you have two of these in hand you can draw 6 cards without any cost (well other than the cards taking up space in your deck) after losing a unique ally and if you are playing with unique allies that can be discarded or destroyed and then brought back (or returned to hand) like Glorfindel or Gamlings effect you can sort of semi abuse this effect as you get the ally back anyway but still get this huge card draw. \n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2425290","commentId":2425290,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1474524628,"content":"Why does Glorf look the other side?\n\nEdit: you cannot actually play Word of Command since there are no Istarti characters in play.\n\nEdited September 22, 2016 by 987654321"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2425303","commentId":2425303,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1474526190,"content":"> Some I love, some I dislike because they mess with cards I already like as is, some are OP, all are interesting.

Makes me wish they had valour from the beginning.\n\nCare to elaborate at least a little? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n \n\nPsychoRocka, now getting to you.\n\n \n\nRear Guard - just a clarification, but you cannot discard an ally you don't control (you can't generally pay for card effects with stuff you have no control over), so I decided to not waste text box space with a redundant clarification.\n\n \n\nSteward of Gondor - I'm not just trying to stomp on Steward, I'm also trying to give way for other resource generating effects.\n\n \n\nKeen Eyed Took - it feels to me like a 2-cost 1/1/0/2 ally became somewhat \"good tone\" for this game. Deviations from that stat box should be followed by some significantly effective card texts. Example of fail: Mirkwood Pioneer (oh man, I should probably buff him too! need to find a fitting art now, ****). He has an optional doomed trigger, yet his stat sux major league balls and you'll never pay 2 for him outside the rare need to trigger his ability. Generally, you wouldn't even include him.\n\n \n\nSword that was Broken - you know me, I hate significant effects only available to a single name out of the entire roster. Also, the power of this card rose significantly with it being able to work on any Dunedain or Noble, not just Aragorn, so nerfs in form of restricted are not that devastating to me. On the doing something for Aragorn... I can think of it costing 1 less for him, like Helgruim (sorry if I misspelled that, don't wanna to break the answer for google) costs 1 less for Theonden. However, dat text box is already crowded...\n\nAlso, about the art. It's surprised me greatly, but I couldn't find a **** thing that remotely resembles the sword that was broken. If anybody has anything - please, SEND!\n\n \n\nSneak Attack - you might wan't to reserve your judgement until you see what have I done with Gandalf ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\nDunedain Wanderer - I also upped his health to 3. But the main change is willpower, yes, as I consider stuff that can't properly quest - has no place in secrecy.\n\n \n\nCommon Cause - exactly on spot. These old \"little\" cards, their badness is half of their misfortune, the other half is how little they actually do. You need to add them some additional bang to entice the player to use them, however you cannot add the flat bang, so you need to make it optional to keep the balance at bay.\n\n \n\nGuard of the Citadel - the entire point of his optional boost is to keep him at cost of 2. He was previously just a 1/1/0/2 Gondor body. There is 1/1/0/1 neutral Gondor body that essentially costs 1, and there is also 1/1/0/2 Gondor body with cost 2 that can move resources, so I opted for him to fit his name and be actual Guard. 3 def is strong, yet I don't think that would break the game, as Leadership (especially gondor) has few defenders, and 3def/2hp is still pretty fragile, enemies exceed attack of 3 frequently, and any shadow attack boost will easily spell doom for the Guard.\n\n \n\nDunedain Watcher - if there is a single thing I learned, it's that self-discarding characters should pack a punch.\n\n \n\nEver Vigilant - this was a very tough one for me. Readying ally is a very worthless thing to do most of the time, and if I slap too much bonuses on top - it can grow out of proportion. It might still be on the weaker side, so I'll see what I can do.\n\n \n\nGrave Cairn - I did a research and found out there are almost no allies who could provide any significant attack boosts for this card to be remotely viable (cept for sneaky Gandalf, but that is too narrow for me), so I went for flat +3 attack. Also, I went from \"leaves play\" to \"is discarded or killed\" to fit the theme more (and justify the cost reduction). It's also not in the same sphere as Eomer, so all is not lost :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nValiant Sacrifice - as with Grave Cairn, I removed the resource cost, but change the trigger from leaving play to being discarded or killed, so you won't be getting cards for sneak attacks, feigning voices, or etc. The cost 0 is associated with the fact that you're 100% losing a character, and probably not in a good way for you.\n\nEdited September 22, 2016 by John Constantine"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2425305","commentId":2425305,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1474526741,"content":"Ah yeah I totally forgot that you can't exhaust or discard allies you don't control yourself for player card costs.

My main point was there are pretty few defenders in the game, and White Tower Watchman is too decent one to get dismissed just because of monosphere ability.\n\nI guess my trouble is that I don't think of 2/3 as a decent defender.  In a hero I think 2/3 has potential as a defender, once you can get attachments to get them up to 4+ defense and can cancel nasty shadows, but I wouldn't risk them for defense unaided except against the weakest of foes.  But a 2/3 ally?  That's a decent *emergency* defender, but he's not going to defend multiple times except against very weak foes, and 3 cost is just too much for a two-hit chump.\n\n \n\nWhite Tower Watchman *does* have something else going for it, in monosphere.  Which is why it's pretty much exclusively in monosphere decks.\n\n \n\nAs a direct defender, I'd rather have Wellinghall Preserver than White Tower Watchmen.  Yes, it's harder to pay for, yes it enters exhausted -- but it's also a natural target for Burning Brand and *self-healing*.  But I rarely defend with the preserver, because their 3 wp is so awesome.\n\n \n\nLongbeard Sentry does cost a full round of tactics resources.  It's also less popular than White Tower Watchmen, and is found almost exclusively in dwarf decks and/or decks that want to discard.  It's 2/3 base defense just isn't enough to buy it for the body, especially in a sphere where you can get 4/1 for 2 resources.  You can also turn Longbeard Sentry into an actual reliable defender with Raiment of War, which doesn't work on White Tower Watchman."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2426448","commentId":2426448,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1474578702,"content":"> I guess we think differently, thats good.

I would say your design abilities are improving noticeably. I think the one trend I almost universally loved was adding valour effects to old cards. I don't think there was one I didn't like. Makes me wish they had valour from the beginning.\n> \n> Care to elaborate at least a little? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nWell, you and I have a fundamental aesthetic difference in that I love items for specific characters and you despise them. So, I won't bother bringing those points up, except that I did not approve of the change that made it so Arod cannot go on ally Legolas. In general there needs to be more cool attachments on allies, not less, particularly unique allies. I do think you found a perfect compromise in dropping restricted for specific character. If you and I were in charge of LOTR I would be able to agree to that. It works pretty well.\n\nYou mount restriction of one per charcter is an absolute no brainer. Most of the time I self impose it anyway (and I am NOT a thematic player). It's just that dumb to have multiple mounts on a character.\n\nMost of your power level \"fixes\" (nerfing OP or strengthening unerplayed) were subtle and effective. I like how you changed power in the earth, although it STILL might not be good enough. I thought Bombur was overall a good change, but I would still be okay with a bonus for \"underground\" locations, like \"if it is an underground location draw a card\". I think, in general, there should be more effort to reward elf tribe location control on \"forest\" locations and dwarf tribe on \"underground\" or \"mountain\" locations, but as an added bonus (so you can still run it on quests without those kinds of locations). It enhances the sense of place the game has as a strength.\n\nI will say again, I love the added valour abilities on old cards. I think I liked lore Glorfindel the best. I liked what you did thematically with the eagle tribe. I was not sure about Eagles of Misty Mountains. I can understand why you made the change. With your version the Eagles can actually go out and come back (because they don't get attached). That is good. I just think the one time boost is not good enough. In fact, I might like it if the eagles could gain a resource when another eagle left play and get a stat boost from each resource, but that sounds so OP that it probably wouldn't work. I just like the permanent stat boost instead of one round.\n\nI didn't like change to boots of erebor because it was too much like weather stained cloak.\n\nI'm sure there was more, but I can't remember.

Fantastic redesign. Even without the valour response it is a simple but great redesign. Even with great stats his threat cost is very high so being able to heal a single point of damage each round for free is a fitting ability. I honestly think he is really great even without the valour response but I just LOVE how thematic and cool that ability is so I can't say a bad thing about it! His free inbuilt healing combined with Elrond allows you to run little to no healing player cards as you already have strong free healing available (2 per round for free is pretty **** decent especially in solo). This gives you more room to include other cards in your deck which is always good.\n-Mirlonde. Again a great redesign for a hero that really needs it. To me the original version of Mirlonde is nigh unplayable. This version is not only playable but fairly good in a Silvan or Mono-lore deck. Minus 3 to starting threat and that nice response as well. Perhaps her response ability should only ready her though? Letting it ready any Silvan Hero might be a bit too good and readying her makes sense because it means you can use her to quest then attack getting the most out of her 2/2/1/3 statline. We need more characters with the scout trait and I hate heroes with only one trait so I like this addition too.\n\n-Bilbo. Perhaps only 1 less threat considering his draw ability has been improved to any player. At 7 threat + the new version of his ability he is pretty fantastic. Then again he does have very average stats (2 def is wasted and 1 attack sucks, even 2 willpower is only ok) so perhaps the lower threat and better ability together are still balanced. I have never played this hero so have no idea to be honest.\n-Gildor. Oh man why couldn't Gildor have been printed like this.... I have actually grown to really dislike Gildor.... I used to absolutely LOVE his card but that has faded. So his ability needs you to exhaust him yet he has absolutely awesome stats... as well as that Imladris Stargazer has a very similar effect and is very cheap to play. This means that the vast majority of games I do not use his ability at all and all he does is quest for 3 or occasionally defend with 3 (he is still amazing just boring and not used to his full potential). You can obviously combo his ability with Vilya to play something from your hand for free which admittedly can actually be really great if you end up with an great but expensive card in your hand and Vilya in play. With resource acceleration through Arwen though I can usually play whatever is in my hand fairly quickly and can then play a card of my choice for free with Vilya as well with the Stargazer.\nSo essentially his ability is rarely if ever necessary thanks to Stargazer and the fact that I usually need his 3 willpower far more than I need his ability. This version you have created is absolutely amazing. Rather than being able to use his ability per turn it only triggers the once but you don't need to exhaust him for it to trigger he just needs to enter play. I like that you only get to draw one and have to discard another and put the third back on your deck. Ties in with Noldor discard, still provides a tiny amount of scry (only the top card but still!) and draws you a card of your choice from the three. Maybe giving him the ability to be played from your discard is a bit much... I do really like this and he does cost 5 like Glorfindel and has similar amazing stats. The only issue is that his second ability will trigger again if he is destroyed/discarded then played again from your discard which is obviously your intent but as neat as this is perhaps this is a bit too good? Don't get me wrong I love the redesign as is but perhaps he is just that little tiny bit too strong. **** do I wish the actual Gildor only triggered his ability upon entering play and didn't require exhausting.....\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2427184","commentId":2427184,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1474626414,"content":"Regarding Gildor - it always baffled me how such powerful stat box at such high price had such weak self-exhausting action.

I had to restrict that +1 wp for questing to justify the price reduction to 1 to make it viable. However, a little additional kick won't hurt the card, and in a spheric situation in vacuum where you reveal that attachment discarding treachery/shadow card, and you have both favor of the lady and almost any other attachment in the game - what are you going to discard? The response to self-discarding is not supposed to be the selling point, it's supposed to be a nice bonus in case something happens, which it is.\n> \n>  \n> \n> But attachments in the staging area controlled by the player who played them. Or did I missed the ruling? Is it in the FAQ? Also, while speaking of those \"first player effects\" - I think they suck, to be honest. It takes away the choice, and would I rework them, the players would choose a player to draw 3 cards from Ancient Mathom. to gain 3 resources from Ranger's Cache, etc..\n\nYes, willpower costs more than other stats and is arguably more valuable than attack/defense.  Yet I never use Dunedain Quest (or Favor of the Lady) and I *do* use Dunedain Mark and Dunedain Warning.  Willpower might be more valuable, but it isn't *twice*as valuable.  I appreciate that restricting the WP to questing makes it easier to justify selling the more valuable willpower for only 1, but since willpower is used for questing 99% of the time, it's like selling a cheaper attack or defense buff by restricting its use to attacking or defending -- for ordinary use it's just cheaper, and the niche uses that I find more interesting can't use it.  So I don't like having the options restricted in the interest of make it more powerful.\n\n \n\nThe response to discarding is a nice bonus if it's discarded, I'm just pointing out that you'd *never* self-discard it, so it's something that only comes up in a few quests -- given your redesigns have consistently changed buffs responsive to a subset of quests (Underground, orcs, etc), it's an odd choice.  And the buff isn't good enough that I would necessarily choose that attachment in the first place.  Most of all it strikes me as a missed opportunity -- since The Lady is Galadriel, having a cool side-effect from discarding really is a good idea, and extending the discard benefit to non self-discards is a clever buff.  But it would also need a self-discarding action to be usable.\n\n \n\nAFAIK, you didn't miss a ruling on control, I've just never realized the significance of the statement on page 25 that a player controls his cards unless it's taken control of by another player (attachments) or the encounter deck (presumably quests like Carn Dum and Dol Goldur that animate cards).  It never even *occurred* to me to discard traps when a treachery made me discard attachments \"I control\", especially traps that are already attached to an enemy.  And since I control unattached traps, it'd be lovely if the attachment were done via Response, so I could play multiple traps into staging and not have them all attach to the first wimpy monster that comes along.  You'd think I'd have noticed that Damrod's response specifies traps \"you control\" -- I think it's literally the only player card that cares who controls a staging area attachment before it's discarded.\n\n \n\nHowever, if you're going to make war on \"first player\" benefits and change them to \"choose a player\", why not do the same for Ever My Heart Rises?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2428817","commentId":2428817,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1474718459,"content":"> Bombur - you seem to miss the part where he can remain ready until all encounter cards are revealed, and then decide if his threat reduction is needed or would you rather use him in combat.

To the Sea!:  89 (66 with Lore)\n\n \n\nAs you can see, Lore is present in a healthy percentage of the decks with songs in them, but it's not popular even as a one off, even free.  Rivendell Minstrel is three times more popular, although there are better values for your questing dollar -- because of the nature of how songs are used.  Most of them are ones you want to play ASAP and once, not ones that you want to play throughout the game.  The four cards that are of that type just aren't popular enough for Love of Tales to pay off very often.  Making Love of Tales available to non-Lore heroes doesn't change that.\n\n \n\nWith Love of Tales changed to non-Lore heroes, the \"Limit 1\" is pointless -- and honestly, it's pretty pointless for the original and is one of the reason that it is a coaster.  The *exhaustion* cost is necessary to prevent getting unlimited resources in a deck contrived for playing songs repeatedly without regard to their utility, but with the exhaustion in place the limit is pointless and unnecessary.\n\n \n\nWhether the exhaustion is necessary in an \"ordinary\" multiplayer setting is less clear -- I personally think not.  Let's say your revised Love of Tales doesn't exhaust and isn't limit 1.  I put all three in my deck on my heroes, some other player plays three songs and I get *9* resources in a single turn from them.  Woohoo!  Overpowered city, right?\n\n \n\nExcept it's hard to imagine an ordinary multiplayer game where another player would spend his turn playing three songs at the point of the game where I've already got all my Love of Tales out.  What possible combination of songs would be useful in planning at that point in the game?  This isn't something that's going to naturally happen.\n\n \n\nAnd while resources materialized at of \"thin air\" in this instance, it wasn't really thin air -- I spent three precious deck slots on Love of Tales, I drew them instead of some other card, and I played all three at a cost of 3 resources.  Like money, the value of resources isn't constant through time -- early resources are more precious than late resources, but at 1-cost Love of Tales needs you to sink precious resources early so you take advantage of the rare song play later.  It's a non-starter at 1 cost.  (The nerfed Master of Lore has a similar problem -- over time it will still pay your investment back, but it's expensive early when you can least afford it.)\n\n \n\nIt's not attractive at 0-cost, either.  Like many other unloved 0-cost cards, free isn't really free when you have it taking space in your deck.  Even a 0-cost card needs to be obviously useful for your deck to justify drawing it instead of a more powerful 1-cost card.\n\n \n\nSo the obvious solution to fix weak 0-cost cards is this -- draw a card as part of the effect, making them *truly* free by removing the deck slot cost, at least for deckbuilders who don't have their heart set on having exactly 50 cards.  This would at least make your revised Love of Tales worth playing *if* it were still 0-cost.  If you have your heart set on 1-cost for them, that's not enough, but it might be if you combined in with this -- make Love of Tales *itself* a song.  That way the second copy becomes free and the third copy becomes net-one positive."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2431091","commentId":2431091,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1474901480,"content":"> Swift Strike doesn't have conditions like specific hero traits, or engagement cost higher than your threat, nor does it triggers upon enemy engagement, so you can play it even on an enemy that is already engaged with you.

That enemy is considered to have 50 Engagement cost and does not contribute its threat to the staging area until the end of the round.\n\n \n\nOR\n\nFresh Tracks\n\n1 cost Leadership Event.\nResponse: After an enemy is added to the staging area, deal 1 damage to that enemy. That enemy gets -2 threat and is considered to have 50 engagement cost until the end of the round.\n\nWhat do you think John? I like the first one better even though it changes the card quite a bit and effects an enemy already in staging instead of one being revealed during staging. I think it is thematic that you exhaust a ranger (rangers following the fresh tracks of enemies) and makes even more sense that the enemy is already in play because you are tracking its movements as it tries to pursue or find you (engage). This would still help stop enemies engaging or with \"surprise\" effects when the enemy engagement cost needs to be higher than your threat. It also gives a nice little boost to questing like Radagasts Cunning by dropping the enemies threat or by reducing it to zero until the end of the round. Maybe both effects at once for one cost and exhausting a ranger is a bit too good especially on nastier foes as you are getting in a point of damage, reducing their threat (from potentially 3 or 4 to zero) and not having to engage them for a round/getting bonuses against them in combat because of your threat being lower than their engagement.\n\n \n\nJust a thought really because Radagasts Cunning is so average and fresh tracks is so situational/specific.\n \n\nEdited October 3, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230661-im-back-with-a-whole-load-of-reworked-stuff/?do=findComment&comment=2440395","commentId":2440395,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1475473473,"content":"It's an awesome solution, however it unfortunately goes against the core concept of the project: I intend to revitalize cards, and melding them together is whole other thing. If Radagast's Cunning and Hidden Paths are still subpar even with blank effect, I'll strive to find a way to improve them until they aren't. As for Fresh Tracks themselves, they sure can take some more nourishment, and I think I know what might work now.\n\nEdited October 3, 2016 by John Constantine"}]}
