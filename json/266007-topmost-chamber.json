It says the quest is advanced before you trigger responses to the active location being explored. That's the only way I've been able to keep it straight in my head - by interpreting that the location does leave play immediately, but responses (and forced effects) don't trigger until you finish placing progress.\n\nWhich is weird, and potentially confusing to resolve, and it'd be easier if things had been ruled to just work active location first in all cases, but I don't know that it's actually inconsistent."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/266007-topmost-chamber/?do=findComment&comment=3149999","commentId":3149999,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1514844171,"content":"I could get on board with that interpretation.  If that's the case, then that would answer the Topmost Chamber situation in the OP (i.e., that you don't place progress on the next stage) since it requires the location to leave play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/266007-topmost-chamber/?do=findComment&comment=3150124","commentId":3150124,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1514851813,"content":"Okay, so let me see if I have this straight:\n\n 1.

Core Rules page 22 says \"Additional progress tokens earned against the quest do not carry over to the next stage.\" So if you advance quest, you can't carry over progress already accumulated.\n\nTo me, the distinction is for Thing in the Depths, you are still on the same quest stage - you haven't advanced. When you clear the Helm, you are still on stage 1b.

But my point is you are always questing against the current quest. If there's an active location, it's the framework rules which use it as a buffer.  So for Thing in the Depths, you quest against stage 1.B - with Helm of the Stormcaller as the active location. The ruling implies once the location is explored, you can place the remaining progress on the ooriginal target quest.\n\nIf the target quest is completed, the core rule about not carrying over progress kicks in - same as for clearing side quests, or any scenario where you would place excess progress on a \"standard\" quest - you wouldn't carry that over to the next quest stage.\n\nThe subtle difference between Thing in the Depths and Tower of Cirith Ungol is that for the latter, you have already added enough progress onto the quest - but you still need to travel to Topmost Chamber, and then need one more turn questing against stage 2.B to clear the active location. Once cleared, the stage moves on, but you lose any \"carry over\" progress. \n\nHope this makes sense!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/266007-topmost-chamber/?do=findComment&comment=3216604","commentId":3216604,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1518788654,"content":"Oh, so what you're saying is that stage whatever-the-main-quest-is is considered the current quest, and when you advance after exploring the Helm or the Chamber, there is a different main quest (which is not the current quest).

But I'd argue that Pressing Need kicks in in the staging process, before questing is resolved. With Top Chamber, you can't put progress on it directly - you try to put progress on the quest stage, which has to be stage 2B. Framework rules buffer your progress against stage 2B onto Topmost Chamber. So I suppose to be more exact, my take would be that when you start quest resolution is when your current quest counts."}]}
