If it is then it deals one damage to all your characters and if it isn't then it deals two. You don't go back an reevaluate if it was defended or not just because the effect killed the defender.\n\nHowever after the Shadow effect is resolved the attack is now undefended and you need to choose your 'lucky' hero to absorb all the damage. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45779-question-hummerhorns-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=458984","commentId":458984,"userName":"ChinaBlade2","timestamp":1303753324,"content":"Thank you for this clarification - this is the way I have been playing it.\n\nIn one game, even just the +1 damage manage to wipe out 4 of my characters!

You have to deal with them whether it comes up as a Enemy or a Shadow effect. That is one of the reasons I like Spirit. Hasty Stroke is sometimes a lifesaving card. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45779-question-hummerhorns-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=459006","commentId":459006,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1303755281,"content":"Does the Hummerhorns primary effect take place if you optionally engage them?
