My own thoughts are as follows, but to be sure I'm asking it in here. When Erestor passes to you in the Refresh Phase you can use him, since you didn't do it yet that round. And before he leaves you again the next round you can do it again since you didn't use him yet this new round. These 2 moments don't violate with the limit once per round. But it would make his action twice as strong in a 2 player game, since every player can still renew a card every round. The downside however is that if we add up the numbers we find Erestor gets triggered 2x a round, so therefore my question. \n\nErestor.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Long-Dark/Erestor.png]\n\nEdited January 12, 2015 by Jban"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131704-limit-once-per-round-defender-of-the-west/?do=findComment&comment=1403187","commentId":1403187,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1421091979,"content":"Based on previous rulings, I think it's legit to use it twice per turn in this situation.  But I'm not 100% sure. \n\nEdit: I was wrong.  Once per round and once per phase are specific to the card.  Once per game is the only exception that applies to each player.\n\n \n\nAn interesting comparison is Rider of the Mark.  That card has limit once per round and has a built-in way to change owners.  Does anyone play that as \"limit once per round per player\"?  A quick search of the FFG and BGG forums is inconclusive.\n\nEdited January 13, 2015 by Teamjimby"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131704-limit-once-per-round-defender-of-the-west/?do=findComment&comment=1403496","commentId":1403496,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1421100925,"content":"I am leaning towards that the ability follows the character in this instance.

So when Erestor transfers for DotW, although the new first player hasn't used his ability that round, that doesn't matter - Erestor has used his ability that round. The only way to circumvent this is to have the card leave play and return, because then it would be considered to be a different Erestor than the one which used the ability the first time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131704-limit-once-per-round-defender-of-the-west/?do=findComment&comment=1404150","commentId":1404150,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1421142323,"content":"Limits are global, only \"once per game\" limits are considered per player.\n\nEdited January 13, 2015 by alogos"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131704-limit-once-per-round-defender-of-the-west/?do=findComment&comment=1404507","commentId":1404507,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1421163856,"content":"> Based on previous rulings, I think it's legit to use it twice per turn in this situation.  But I'm not 100% sure. \n> \n>  \n> \n> An interesting comparison is Rider of the Mark.  That card has limit once per round and has a built-in way to change owners.  Does anyone play that as \"limit once per round per player\"?  A quick search of the FFG and BGG forums is inconclusive.\n\n \n\n \n\nI guess you would have to play it 'once per round per player' any way you look at it -- otherwise, what is that limit text intended for?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131704-limit-once-per-round-defender-of-the-west/?do=findComment&comment=1404557","commentId":1404557,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1421165559,"content":"Well, it's once per round... not sure why you would read it like \"per player\" when it is not written like this...
