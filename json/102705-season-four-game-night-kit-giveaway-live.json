But now with a new cards is waling in the park. So Nmode should make it awesome.\n\nAlso Ambush idea from Return to Rivendell. Also cool mechanic but never work….very easy quest. Nmode should change it!\n\nAll second cycle will be amazing…..Balrog…? I love shadow and flame but to boring now……….Nmode for Balrog also should be awesome!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102705-season-four-game-night-kit-giveaway-live/?do=findComment&comment=1032725","commentId":1032725,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1396233531,"content":">  \n> \n> > I'm most looking forward to Assault on Osgiliath for a Nightmare overhaul.

Escape was nearly impossible for a solo deck to consistently win at, but pretty doable for 3-4 players. Maybe they can do the opposite for Assault, and make it difficult for 1-2 players without making it impossible for 3-4."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102705-season-four-game-night-kit-giveaway-live/?do=findComment&comment=1033447","commentId":1033447,"userName":"oldoly","timestamp":1396286265,"content":"I look forward to the Khazad Dum expansion.
