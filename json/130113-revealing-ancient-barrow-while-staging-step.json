For Ancient Barrow, this would mean that the card remains a 'facedown' card under Ancient Barrow.  Since Ancient Barrow has now been discarded, I would discard Tom as well (best guess).\n\n \n\nAlso as a side point, I would not resolve the 'shuffle Tom and the discard pile back into the encounter deck' portion of Tom's When Revealed effect.  The reason being that, once Tom has left play, the effect no longer applies.  I'm just guessing... but basing this on the FAQ entry about the resolution of Sneak Attack vs. the Beorn ally's Action.  In that case, once Beorn is no longer in play (via Sneak Attack), the part about shuffling Beorn back into your deck 'no longer applies.'  I see a similar case here with Tom Bombabil, and would resolve accordingly (Tom stays in the discard pile).\n\nEdited December 28, 2014 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/130113-revealing-ancient-barrow-while-staging-step/?do=findComment&comment=1384271","commentId":1384271,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1419836688,"content":"Hi GrandSpleen,\n\n \n\nthanks for your answers. We played it so. All allies left play when placed facedown under ancient barrow. Tom Bombadil was discarded without effect after ancient barrow left play as an explored location."}]}
