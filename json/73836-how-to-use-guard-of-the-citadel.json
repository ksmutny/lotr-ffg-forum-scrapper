It works as one of those \"filler\" cards in a theme deck when you run out of good ones to use.\n\nCannon fodder works to, and i've used them as such in many situations.\n\nMy advice: Look for event cards matching \"cannon fodder\" card's keywords. GotC doesn't cost much resource, but if you can pump him up with an event card or two, he becomes cheap AND effective."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73836-how-to-use-guard-of-the-citadel/?do=findComment&comment=721244","commentId":721244,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1352546083,"content":"He's also valuable for his willpower.

Throw in the Snowstorm shadow effect and you can't really rely on him to meat shield on the mountain either. But he is a cheap, multi-use, non-unique Leadership ally, something that sphere still doesn't have that many of in comparison to other spheres."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73836-how-to-use-guard-of-the-citadel/?do=findComment&comment=721308","commentId":721308,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1352560650,"content":"I was thinking more about quest card 3b.  You would not be questing with this guy, but he can survive up there while many other allies are discarded as soon as you flip to that card. Like you say, not reliable, but not an auto-discard either."}]}
