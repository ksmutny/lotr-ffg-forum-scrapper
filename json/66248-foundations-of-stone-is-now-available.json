When he draws that hero, he puts it into play.\"\n\nThis raises two rules questions in my mind:\n\n1. What happens if the shuffled hero gets into your hand by a mechanism other than \"drawing\" (eg Gandalf's Search)? By strict reading, you couldn't then put the hero into play. (the AGOT card game, I believe, maintains a careful distinction between drawing a card and putting a card into your hand).\n\n2. What happens if the hero gets attached to a Nameless Thing? Does the hero's \"threat cost\" count towards the Nameless Thing's stats? (I think not, as the rules do distinguish quite clearly between \"cost\" and \"threat cost\" - \"cost is not found on hero cards\")"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66248-foundations-of-stone-is-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=647070","commentId":647070,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1340208336,"content":"Wow yeah, that treachery card is crazy, if that's what it does.

I think if you draw or take hero somehow in your hand (cose with gandalf you draw cards anaway) you put him to play.\n\nIF Hero card attach to NT it doesn  give a bonus cose hero card dont have a  cost.

When you just advance through the quest, keeping drawing 1 card per refresh phase, then its just hero trying to unite with his friends again, but if you spend some cards that allow you to get him from the deck faster, than it's something like \"group is searching for the lost comrade\" and therefore there is nothing wrong with it. From my perspective, of course. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66248-foundations-of-stone-is-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=647211","commentId":647211,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1340244421,"content":"jjeagle said:\n\n \n\nBut what about those cards that would allow a hero to enter your hand from your play deck BUT do not use the word \"draw\"?

If an effect does not use the word \"draw\", then you are not \"drawing\" cards. This would be consistent with, for instance, the rules on \"When Revealed\" - cards are only \"revealed\" from the encounter deck when that word is specifically used."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66248-foundations-of-stone-is-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=647219","commentId":647219,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1340246125,"content":"Agreed.

This would also fit with the earlier statement that an Elven Ring would feature in that quest. Elrond could also have some global Noldor-boosting ability a la Dain which would cap the Noldor theme of this cycle.\n\nPersonally I don't think Elrond as hero would really work thematically as it's pretty clear he never leaves Rivendell and hasn't for thousands of years. I would sooner see him represented in the game indirectly through events (as he already is with Elrond's Counsel) and maybe a temporary ally like Gandalf."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66248-foundations-of-stone-is-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=647461","commentId":647461,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1340288759,"content":" We did get the new Glory right?  The ring though…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66248-foundations-of-stone-is-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=647465","commentId":647465,"userName":"Boris_the_Dwarf","timestamp":1340289622,"content":" Do we have a card list yet?
