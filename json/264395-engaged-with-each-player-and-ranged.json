I remember seeing a ruling that said you could not declare ranged attacks against an enemy you are engaged with. I was hoping by posting here someone who remembers it can dig it up.\n\nI know the core set rules regarding ranged, but those were not written with these types of enemies in mind.\n\nSay I have Legolas with a Rivendell bow as my only attacker. You're saying I can choose whether or not to activate the bow depending on whether I want to declare the attack as ranged or not? This seems weird to me.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264395-engaged-with-each-player-and-ranged/?do=findComment&comment=3106667","commentId":3106667,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1512258527,"content":"Actually I personally don't think you would have a choice re Rivendell Bow, it would always apply.\n\nFrom the FAQ: \"Q: What counts as a “ranged” attack? A: A ranged attack is an attack made by a character with the ranged keyword against an enemy engaged with another player.\"\n\nUntil they add 'and not engaged with you' to that definition the resolution of this situation seems clear. If the character has ranged, the attack is ranged, even if the enemy is also engaged with you and you are declaring the attack and also using a bunch of your non-ranged guys. It seems a little weird but also very straightforward.\n\nThat said, while I can recall no ruling, nor find it, I can at least imagine Caleb issuing a ruling that changes this, but if it was older than a couple of FAQs I would possibly ignore it anyway since any changes he wanted to make to this definition should have made it into the FAQ (and noting his ruling do not always agree with each other and/or later FAQ, I strongly prefer FAQ text when relevant).\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264395-engaged-with-each-player-and-ranged/?do=findComment&comment=3107166","commentId":3107166,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1512315600,"content":"FWIW I have also been unable to find a ruling like Seastan think he remembers, although it has certainly come up before...\n\nhttps://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98943-ranged-attack/?do=findComment&comment=980922 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98943-ranged-attack/?do=findComment&comment=980922]\n\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1069473/ranged-attacks-against-durins-bane [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1069473/ranged-attacks-against-durins-bane]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264395-engaged-with-each-player-and-ranged/?do=findComment&comment=3108297","commentId":3108297,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1512394951,"content":"I would think it'd be reasonable to declare a ranged attack against an enemy engaged with another player even if you are engaged with them also -- but that if you did so, only your ranged attackers could participate."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264395-engaged-with-each-player-and-ranged/?do=findComment&comment=3109463","commentId":3109463,"userName":"PachiLOTR","timestamp":1512426501,"content":"> On 12/2/2017 at 2:09 AM, Seastan said:\n> \n> I seem to remember reading a ruling like this some time ago, but I can no longer find it.\n> \n> In a 2 player game there is an enemy that is considered to be engaged with each player.

So if you were player 4 and had Hour of Wrath and Rivendell Bow on Bard, Bard could join in attacks made by player 1, 2, and 3, getting the +1 from Rivendell Bow for each attack (and stacking up the -2 def if the enemy is not immune) then declare an attack against the enemy yourself in which Bard would not get the +1."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264395-engaged-with-each-player-and-ranged/?do=findComment&comment=3114870","commentId":3114870,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1512681881,"content":"Yeah, I was just referring to Rivendell Bow since Seastan had previously mentioned it."}]}
