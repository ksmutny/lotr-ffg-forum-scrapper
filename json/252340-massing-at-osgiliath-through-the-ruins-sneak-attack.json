If you played sneak attack, you would attempt to put a card into play, but it would stay in your hand since you can only play/put into play one card per turn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252340-massing-at-osgiliath-through-the-ruins-sneak-attack/?do=findComment&comment=2842718","commentId":2842718,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1497882642,"content":"I agree, you cannot meaningfully use Sneak Attack. If you tried playing it then it instructs you to put an ally into play, doing that would then be the second card played/put into play and thus be disallowed by the quest, causing the effect to fizzle.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252340-massing-at-osgiliath-through-the-ruins-sneak-attack/?do=findComment&comment=2843777","commentId":2843777,"userName":"jameswatsonv","timestamp":1497936671,"content":"Thank you very much for the replies! That answer seems very reasonable."}]}
