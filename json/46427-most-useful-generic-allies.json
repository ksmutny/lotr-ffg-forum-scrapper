For me, it would be Silverlode Archer and Erebor Hammersmith. The Archer is moderately expensive, but it is a pretty good attacker, comparable to most heroes, and can help in questing, as well. The Hammersmith is outstanding all around, fairly inexpensive, can help in questing and attacking and with 3 hit points can survive a moderate amount of damage. Any others that players find most useful?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46427-most-useful-generic-allies/?do=findComment&comment=464919","commentId":464919,"userName":"AUCodeMonkey","timestamp":1304764954,"content":"He's not terribly generic, but I've found that my Northern Trackers are insanely useful.

It's a useful card, but I find its fragility rather frustrating. I'd generally rather have Horseback Archer, though it's nice to have Silverlode, Horseback, and Legolas all together for big ranged attacks in a Leadership/Tactics deck.\n\nErebor Hammersmith is very efficient, I agree. Northern Tracker is obviously great but I think we're talking more about the basic cheap allies. Leadership's cheap allies actually seem a bit worse statistically than the other spheres (compare Guard of the Citadel to Wandering Took), probably because they have Faramir and For Gondor! to boost them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46427-most-useful-generic-allies/?do=findComment&comment=464923","commentId":464923,"userName":"AUCodeMonkey","timestamp":1304765861,"content":"Gotcha.

For two resource points, he's a nice toolkit character. He wipes out conditions (take THAT, Caught in a Web and Iron Shackles!), contributes to attacks, and has just enough durability to defend against minor foes, like Dol Goldur Orcs, Wolf Riders and Forest Spiders, for two rounds. His multiple hit points also means he doesn't get eaten by multi-target effects like The Necromancer's Reach or the Hummerhorn's shadow effect.\n\nThe Erebor Hammersmith is a strong 2-point choice as well. He can rescue attachments from the discard pile and contribute to quests or attacks. He's also even more durable than the Miner and can hold off fiercer foes, like Dol Goldur Beast Masters, East Blight Patrols, Wargs or King Spiders, for two rounds, or minor foes for three. When questing I also like to use him as a target for the Dol Goldur Orcs' \"when revealed\" effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46427-most-useful-generic-allies/?do=findComment&comment=464954","commentId":464954,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1304771177,"content":"Gondorian Spearman and Snowbourn Scout are two of my favorites."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46427-most-useful-generic-allies/?do=findComment&comment=465022","commentId":465022,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1304788496,"content":"Yeah, this post was intended to talk about the allies that don't have a proper name, so they are more or less \"generic\". Therefore, Northern Tracker is a valid choice. I wasn't going to ask about the \"name\" allies, because I have no doubt that Gandalf would be almost everyone's choice. I have to admit to having a bit of a prejudice against the Took. As a solo player, his ability is of no use and his artwork, just lazily sitting under a tree, doesn't inspire me to use him. Just a personal bias, I guess. What do you guys think of Daughter of the Nimrodel? I've found her quite useful when I've played her, but I haven't played her all that much, that's why she wasn't in my list. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46427-most-useful-generic-allies/?do=findComment&comment=465033","commentId":465033,"userName":"Kzer-za","timestamp":1304791456,"content":"Wandering Took isn't great, but his stats are solid enough for 2 cost.

When you're already topped off, that point of Willpower is great for questing.

In fact I've found it often pays to try to keep the Spearmen alive and use them to finish off wounded enemies.\n\nThe Northern Trackers are almost imbalanced even for their high cost.
