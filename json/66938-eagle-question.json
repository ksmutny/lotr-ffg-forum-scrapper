Return that character to its owners hand.\"\n\n \n\nCan i choose eagle ally in discard pile?

Landroval for example costs 5 to play (which isn't cheap).\n\nThe only reason I can think of could be that the eagle character has so many wounds on it that it is close to being killed, in which case you return it to your hand to play again.\n\nI presume in this case it returns as an ally with all of it's wounds removed?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66938-eagle-question/?do=findComment&comment=656796","commentId":656796,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1341997293,"content":"Correct, when an ally returns to your hand and then you play it again, it will not carry any wound, essentially healing it.\n\nMoreover, there is an eagle ally that deals two damages to an enemy in the staging area when it comes into play and leaves play, so you will want to return it to your hand (thus deals two damages) and then play it again (deal two damages again)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66938-eagle-question/?do=findComment&comment=656837","commentId":656837,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1342002304,"content":"Angus Lee said:\n\nCorrect, when an ally returns to your hand and then you play it again, it will not carry any wound, essentially healing it.\n\nMoreover, there is an eagle ally that deals two damages to an enemy in the staging area when it comes into play and leaves play, so you will want to return it to your hand (thus deals two damages) and then play it again (deal two damages again).\n\n\n\n \n\nIt's the Descendant of Thorondor ally.\n\n \n\nThat is a very good reason to return it to your hand, instead of letting him go to discard pile"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66938-eagle-question/?do=findComment&comment=660186","commentId":660186,"userName":"Chaos101","timestamp":1342593001,"content":"Thanks, Guys.\n\n \n\nBut what happens to Vassal of the Winglord?\n\nAfter using Vassal in the combat phase, you have to discard it.
