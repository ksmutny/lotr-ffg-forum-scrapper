I lean towards a one deck to rule them all style (though I make multiple decks frequently, I just try to build them so they hold up against anything). And if it can't beat those it's not going to hold up when the going gets tough. If I really think a given deck might be pretty weak I'll start with Nightmare Passage Through Mirkwood, which is the right a mount of difficulty that I can see the weaknesses of my decks.\n\n \n\nI don't really feel that there's a solid all in questing quest within the first three cycles. So I might use Into the Pit or Redhorn Gate, but those are generally pretty easy quests, so they don't tell me too much besides my capacity for willpower."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223528-deck-test-quests/?do=findComment&comment=2283908","commentId":2283908,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1467034565,"content":"Massing at Osgiliath for solo, Assault on Osgiliath for coop.
