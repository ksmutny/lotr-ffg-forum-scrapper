I was playing @banania [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/252848-banania/]'s campaign \"Tale of years\" campaign (which is great by the way) and had the \"oops\" moment where I totally forgot about Na'asiyah's ability, and had 4 events in hand and was trying to figure out how to get rid of them before I got sliced."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307996-paying-without-playing/?do=findComment&comment=3955787","commentId":3955787,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1593153684,"content":"> On 4/27/2020 at 8:25 PM, rees263 said:\n> \n> I agree, if you play the card then you have to follow the text.\n> \n> However, some events can end up doing nothing, for example, Man the Walls does nothing by itself and there is nothing stopping you from playing it even if there can't or won't be any allies played in the same phase.\n\nThis response comes two months later, but I just want to point out that in the rules reference [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/90/19/90191e4e-a341-4379-b398-5963b7a87ebf/mec01_online_only_rules_reference_for_website.pdf], under \"Cost\", it says that you cannot pay the cost of a card if \"its effect does not have the potential to change the game state\" (emphasis mine). So, for example, the 1-cost Leadership event Ever Vigilant (\"Choose and ready 1 ally card\") could not be played if nobody has any ally cards out. But Man the Walls (\"Reduce the cost of the next ally played by each player this phase by 1\") can be played even if it ends up doing nothing because nobody played any allies, because it did change the game state: it created a lasting effect that wasn't there before. Whether or not that effect whiffed is irrelevant: creating a lasting effect always counts as changing the game state, because it puts a new rule into play for a certain time.\n\nI mention this because I came across your \"some events can end up doing nothing\" sentence and thought at first that it was incorrect until I checked the text on the Man the Walls card. And so, since fewer people seem to be familiar with the Rules Reference than with the FAQ, I figured it was worth mentioning."}]}
