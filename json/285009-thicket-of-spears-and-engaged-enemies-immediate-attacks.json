That player's engaged enemies cannot attack that player this phase.\n\nWhat happens if a player engages enemies after having played Thicket of Spears but before enemy attack resolution? Can the newly engaged enemies also not attack that player, or does this only apply to enemies who where engaged with that player, when Thicket of Spears was played? I guess since it doesn't mention \"currently\" it tracks boardstate and applies to all newly engaged enemies as well?\n\nOn a similar note: \n\nWhat happens when an enemy engaged with said player would make an \"immediate attack\"?\n\nDoes Thicket of Spears prevent these as well as regular attacks? No idea about that one...\n\n \n\nThanks in advance!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285009-thicket-of-spears-and-engaged-enemies-immediate-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=3511927","commentId":3511927,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1540282221,"content":"Correct on both counts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285009-thicket-of-spears-and-engaged-enemies-immediate-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=3512178","commentId":3512178,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1540304887,"content":"Actually, don't player card effects only calculate when played?

Player cards generally do not - lending themselves more to immediate evaluation, but sometimes leading to exciting question like this one.\n\nI had previously taken it to be an effect on the player, so newly engaged enemies would not attack, and I was content with that for myself given I rare play this card, but I now suspect it was wrong. The object of the effect seems to be 'that player's engaged enemies', rather than the chosen player themselves and that would mean the set of enemies is fixed at time of play.\n\n \n\nOn your second question, yes it would prevent any extra 'immediate' attacks. Cannot is a pretty strong work in this game and the effect isn't explicitly limited to any specific causes of attack or timing point, so it affects all.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285009-thicket-of-spears-and-engaged-enemies-immediate-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=3512757","commentId":3512757,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1540333521,"content":"> 7 hours ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> Actually, don't player card effects only calculate when played?

Cards that enter play (or change status to meet the criteria of the specified set) after a lasting effect’s establishment are not subsequently affected by that lasting effect.\n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285009-thicket-of-spears-and-engaged-enemies-immediate-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=3512762","commentId":3512762,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1540333782,"content":"Ah, my apologies.
