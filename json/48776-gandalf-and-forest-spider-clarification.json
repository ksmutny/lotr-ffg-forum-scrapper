I'm enticed!\n\nProbably because of the transation I need a clarification on Gandalf and the Forest Spider. Can you help me?\n\nFOREST SPIDER: If I volontary engage it (before engagement checks) it still gets is +1 Attack or engaging it circumvents this effect?\n\nGANDALF: At the end of the round Gandalf is discarded in the discard pile of his player or is totaly removed from the game, put away in the box? I think the latter, but I prefer to verify ^^"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48776-gandalf-and-forest-spider-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=488277","commentId":488277,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1308578938,"content":"Hi!\n\n \n\n1.: The first round you fight against it (doesn't matter if you engaged it by your choice or not), it gets +1 Att.

This is specified in the English rule book on P.16\n\nWhether an enemy is engaged through an engagement\ncheck, through a card effect, or through a player’s\nchoice, the end result is the same, with the enemy\nand the player engaging one another. In all cases, the\nplayer is considered to have engaged the enemy and the\nenemy is considered to have engaged the player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48776-gandalf-and-forest-spider-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=488298","commentId":488298,"userName":"Ryver2","timestamp":1308581440,"content":"pumpkin said:\n\nYou are right on both counts, engaging and being engaged are the same thing mechanically.

The Att. value is useful, AFAIR, only after it engages you. Isn't it, now, basically a 3 Att. monster?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48776-gandalf-and-forest-spider-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=489095","commentId":489095,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1308714070,"content":"On the turn it engages you, the Forest Spider is 3 ATT, for all following turns it is 2 ATT.
