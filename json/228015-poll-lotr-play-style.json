Everything takes so long in 2-handed (what to play, how much to commit to a quest, who shall defend etc.), and I build a lot (I am not even playing all my decks) so the time factor is big for me. The hardest thing to remember in 2 handed for me is threat rising (both doomed and end of the turn). I think I never end up with the threat I should have (often 1-3 points less, but sometimes 1-2 points more)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228015-poll-lotr-play-style/?do=findComment&comment=2373134","commentId":2373134,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1471547652,"content":"I play 3 or 4 players game with coordinate decks usually, thanks to octgn.

As someone whose job entails staring at a computer screen all day, for me, tabletop is often a way of getting away from electronic devices for an hour or two. And the particular tactile experience of a card game has always been appealing to me -- flipping over that treachery, or physically drawing into Gandalf, seems more dramatically epic than clicking on a screen and seeing a tiny card picture appear. Even the simple act of reshuffling the encounter deck when it empties -- a quick breath and an \"Ohh crap, here we go again...\" -- has its pleasures.\n\nI grant that building and breaking down decks can take a while, but even that is fun for me. Flipping through my bindered card pages constantly reminds me of the awesome art in the game and gives me ideas for new decks simply by glimpsing the cards again."}]}
