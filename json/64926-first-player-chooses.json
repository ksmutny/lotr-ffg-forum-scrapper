The only restriction involves costs (cards with the \"pay X to do Y\" structure, such as Strength of Will, Protector of Lorien, etc.). A player--any player--can only pay costs with cards he or she controls. Otherwise, the first player usually has carte blanche when selecting targets (taking into account any restrictions stipulated on the cards themselves). "}]}
