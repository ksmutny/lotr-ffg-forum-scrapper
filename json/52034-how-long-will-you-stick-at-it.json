Like a Helms Deep defense quest or Escape through Moria, etc. Yes, they've been done before, but those are the memorable events. It would be like making an Indiana Jones game and not including the Ark or the Grail stuff.\n\nI get that they're trying to incorporate more of the story than just what's in the trilogy. Still, playing obscure or unknown heroes is kinda lame.

This is my first LCG and I find the concept very appealing.  Besides, the notion of monthly adventure packs which contain a completely new story/scenario to test your deck(s) against is great. All other TCGs I played so far repeat and get boring with time, because the objective (e.g. reducing the enemies life from 20 to 0 etc.) in general stays the same. But what I've got with LotR so far is (next to an intro scenario) an ambush players have to escape from, a \"search and rescue\" mission, a \"don't lose the trail\" mission and a \"search for local forces and then battle the enemies\" mission. Quite a variety in my opinion.\n\nThe delay between the core set and HfG has been annoying, but I hope this is just bad luck and FFG keeps supporting this game the same way as AGoT or CoC!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52034-how-long-will-you-stick-at-it/?do=findComment&comment=518971","commentId":518971,"userName":"Eyedunno53","timestamp":1314124274,"content":"I have already preordered all of the currently planned expansions through my local gaming store.  Hopefully they dont have a problem getting them at a reasonable pace.  If so, I might have to cancel and find them online instead.  Hasn't been an issue for me so far, but I know some people have had problems with it.\n\nThat said, I'm with The_Big_Show.  I got this game to play solo, and it lets me do just that.  So, unless FFG starts only publishing scenerios that are all but impossible to win solo (darn you Dol Guldor), then I will likely keep investing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52034-how-long-will-you-stick-at-it/?do=findComment&comment=519008","commentId":519008,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1314129772,"content":"I plan to stick with it, really enjoying it.

I had huge expectations for this game which usually leads to disappointment but it hasn't let me down yet! It's an original, creative concept and is the best thematic fit of any game I've ever played, plus it's Lord of the Rings the most popular fantasy world ever. I also think that cooperating with others will always trump competing against others (call it faith). And each expansion has added something really fresh to the game play. I think this game has a long life ahead of it!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52034-how-long-will-you-stick-at-it/?do=findComment&comment=520587","commentId":520587,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1314411607,"content":"Couple of months before me and few more players only complain about game is to easy. I like to see now more and more players start to complain too.\n\nFor me is only 1 problem with the game is difficult level. For now game is to easy. Yes Massing in Osgiliath is only 1 quest which provide you a real challenge and request all your player skill. And with 2 players quest even more hard. But HFG and other quests is to easy for proff players. But at least we start to get Nes packs with difficult 7 ,9 and so on. So its give me hope the game will be more and more hard. We get some new players cards like Burning Brand, Dunadan W and M. Now player deck more powerful!!! SO quests should also provide enough danger when you really will feel adventure and risk to perish in.\n\nAbout good selling of the game.  I remember time of Decipher lotr tcg. Also was very good start. Sell a lot in the first 6 months. Get many awards and so on.\n\nBut after some terrible ideas with Two towers sets, several mistakes and game start slowly die. All depends on designers and players desires.\n\nMy desire more hard more interesting and show us the tournament system!!!!!  \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52034-how-long-will-you-stick-at-it/?do=findComment&comment=520600","commentId":520600,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1314414812,"content":"The quests might not be massively hard multiplayer... yet, though single player still kicks my butt most of the time past the first quest.

This is with 2 core sets.\n\nI also love the thematic nature of the quests so far - much more story attached and plausible than some of the 'other CCG's out there'. LCG is far more affordable to boot.\n\nI'll keep collecting it until they drop the franchise or release utter shite.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52034-how-long-will-you-stick-at-it/?do=findComment&comment=520714","commentId":520714,"userName":"mrtoadz","timestamp":1314445948,"content":"The_Big_Show said:\n\nI plan to keep going with the game.
