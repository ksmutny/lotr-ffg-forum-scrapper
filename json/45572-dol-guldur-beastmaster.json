Choose an enemy. The first player chooses which\nattack (among the enemies to which he is engaged) to\nresolve first.\" (pg.18 of the LotR LCG Rulebook)\n\nI say this simply because on page 16 it states about the engagement phase\n\n\"Note that during this phase enemies do not attack\nplayers, they merely engage players. Enemies attack\nthe players with whom they are engaged during the\ncombat phase (see page 18).\"(pg.16 of the LotR LCG Rulebook)\n\nbut of course there is still confusion on the definition of after. I say it is after all 4 steps have taken place... because that is literally after he attacks. The Shadow effect would resolve and if it says +1 force... tough noogies. but that's me after some examination of the rule book and the card text. maybe not designers intent. It's tough getting all this jazz to mind meld.\n\nplease counter act me if you have some good points on the contrary."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45572-dol-guldur-beastmaster/?do=findComment&comment=457644","commentId":457644,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1303474955,"content":"Iron-on Ghost said:\n\nplease counter act me if you have some good points on the contrary.\n\n\n\nI disagree.
