Play Grim Resolve to ready them all, then Will of the West to reshuffle every card you discarded into your deck. And…play it again !\n\nThe fun part is that provided you have enough time to play it as many times as you need, you may gather as much will as you want and lower your threat level as low as you wish with Elrond's Counsel. Likewise, you may place as many cards as you want from the encounter deck to your victory display with Out of the Wild. It's also interesting to guarantee the return of Gandalf. \n\nloop3.jpg [http://sdajce.perso.sfr.fr/forum/makoto/loop3.jpg]\n\n \n\nSo, has Makoto perfectly understood how players are supposed to make the best of their cards ?\nOr is there something quite unexpected and undesired about the way they are played ? \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66070-makotos-loop/?do=findComment&comment=645435","commentId":645435,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1339871520,"content":" A few things:\n\nPlaying Grim Resolve + Will of the West will take 6 resources every time you wish to do it.  That's difficult do more than once in a round, even with Zigil Miner.  There are simply not enough 6-cost cards to feed to Ziggy for you to do this more than a couple of times.\n\nAlso: Grim Resolve will not ready Unexpected Courage.\n\nSo yes, it's a powerful combo, but it is an extremely expensive combo that requires at least 5 cards to pull off more than once.  I wouldn't call it abusive at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66070-makotos-loop/?do=findComment&comment=645708","commentId":645708,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1339950711,"content":"As i say already many times Beravur is broken!!!
