I hope this will give me a good feel for the different spheres and enough experience for solid deck building. I guess you can consider it my solo-play mission. In addition to this I will of course also enjoy co-op mode!\n\nSo as for the question as to whether the game is fun or not in solo play I'd like to share some thoughts and experience.\n\nI finished my run throughs with the Leadership and the Lore decks. The experience with each sphere is quite different, but great all in all. I love playing this game even alone and some moments are just fantastic.\n\nOne example:\n\nI was in the last quest of Passage through Mirkwood and had to defeat Ungolianths Spawn. I played the Lore sphere deck and I was always slightly overwhelmed and made very slow progress on the questing part and everything. I already put 5 wounds on Ungolianth's Spawn but also was my threat counter on 49! So this to be my last turn, either I'll defeat the Spider for an instant win or I'd lose to the evil forces. And that's when I drew Gandalf, spent 5 resources in my planning phase to slam him on the table and deal an instant 4 points of damage to the Spawn, kill it off and take home the victory!\n\nSo, yes, solo play is fun!\n\nBut I think there are some things that one has to get used to.\n\n1) it is important to remember all the rules since nobody reminds you to keep track of the counters and all the other things. This game requires a lot to remember so I recommend following the rules closely for the first few games. Even now I use the chart with the turn structure in the back of the rules book.\n\n2) Strictly adhere to the rules. Since you're the only player it is easy to be loose on the rules. Quickly fix a forgotten card draw or playing that attachment even though it is already the encounter phase. I was tempted to do so, too in the beginning, but trust me the game is more fun when you stick to the rules and don't re-do errors. Just learn from them and play on. I think the game has to be difficult to be interesting until you build this really powerful deck, sweep through the quests and gorge on its awesomeness!\n\nA good topic illustrating what I mean with point 2 can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=479154 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=479154]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44689-is-solo-play-good/?do=findComment&comment=457625","commentId":457625,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1303473280,"content":"Apophenia said:\n\nAre you raising your threat by the number which you failed to quest by? I shudder to think what would happen to my threat if I didn't quest the first turn (At least +3). That is the number one reason I can't beat the first senario with the Tactics deck.\n\nYes I did. While your threat rating will rise quite a bit in this first round, there's a good chance it will never rise again except by 1 at the end of your turn.\n\nHowever, after having played my fourth game using the tactics deck, I can tell you, this approach cannot work with tactics. In fact, I think you can only win if you get lucky and there's a steady stream of enemies that you kill with Legolas. After my game (which I lost rather spectacularly) I counted the total Willpower in the deck: It's five!\n\nI then created four 30-card decks using mixed spheres for solo play, one 'main sphere' represented by two heroes and a 'supporting sphere'. I mainly included the expensive cards (cost 3+) of the main sphere and the cheap ones (cost < 1) from the supporting sphere and distributed the rest to end up with a similar number of allies in every deck. Here's the Hero combinations I used:\n\n1. Aragorn, Theodred, Thalin (Leadership/Tactics)\n2. Gimli, Legolas, Eowyn (Tactics/Spirit)\n3. Eleanor, Dunhere, Denethor (Spirit/Lore)\n4. Glorfindel, Beravor, Gloin (Lore/Leadership)\n\n \n\nI lost the first game with the first deck due to bad luck (first draw: Ufthak!) but won the four following games with increasing ease (each using a different deck).\n\nNow I feel ready to tackle the second scenario, but after looking at the Hill Troll, I'm not sure if I'll be able to win this without building a strong custom deck (with 3x Gandalf, etc.) for this scenario..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44689-is-solo-play-good/?do=findComment&comment=457632","commentId":457632,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1303473826,"content":"jhaelen said:\n\nApophenia said:\n\n \n\nAre you raising your threat by the number which you failed to quest by?
