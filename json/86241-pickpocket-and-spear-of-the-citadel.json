My question is: If the Pickpocket from Heirs of Numenor already has a damage token on it, and I defend with someone who has Spear of the Citadel attached, does Pickpocket's Forced effect still take place even though he's dead? More specifically, when do the effects that read, \"When this enemy attacks,\" resolve?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86241-pickpocket-and-spear-of-the-citadel/?do=findComment&comment=813122","commentId":813122,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373662973,"content":"EDIT - talked about dwarrowdelf axe and realised it was no help at all!\n\n \n\nwe know from the FAQ that 'after enemy attacks' is after step 4, and 'when this enemy attacks' as step because the errata on beastmaster says deal the shadow card (which is when it attacks) during step 1\n\n \n\nso that would be before step 2 which is declaring defender right?\n\n \n\nso the forced effect would trigger before the spear kills, if i am correct here\n\nrich\n\nEdited July 12, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86241-pickpocket-and-spear-of-the-citadel/?do=findComment&comment=813406","commentId":813406,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1373723140,"content":"That's what I thought, but I wasn't sure...
