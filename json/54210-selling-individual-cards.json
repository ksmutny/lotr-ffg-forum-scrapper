I am seriously loving this game and was umming and arrrring about getting more copies of core for a while but then thought.. hey.. I'm still spending nearly 1/3rd of what I did on MTG, so in a degenerate gambler type thinking I am still \"up\" from were I was when i quit MTG.... in MTG you wouldn't blink twice at spending 40bucks on a single card.\n\nAnyway.. I will be selling all my duplicates above 3.. so will have a lot of cards to sell including some really good ones. I'll also be selling 2x Threat Counters.\n\nWhen the cards arrive I will post them so you can see what is in stock, and if you reply to this post I'll PM you.. if there is a lot of interest I will use ebay auction to sell them and PM everyone who replies so they will not miss it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54210-selling-individual-cards/?do=findComment&comment=537177","commentId":537177,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1317776363,"content":"I would be willing to pay a couple dollars for extras of the encounter sets.
