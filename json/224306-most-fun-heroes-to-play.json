It is fun to find combos with a hero that is immune to player cards. Recently, the pool has been good to him, too, and Beorn is absolutely superb in some scenarios.\n\nTactics Boromir: it works two ways for me, either really really fun, or too good to make things boring.\n\nSpirit Glorfindel. I enjoy immensely to make him a warrior, combine him with the above (and Dúnedain) as a super assassin (Bow, Hands, F&P, ToT).\n\nNoldor discard style including Círdan (Arwen and another hero) with Narya.\n\nGandalf & Elrond with Vilya, though growing rather old now.\n\nCeleborn & Galadriel and the Silvan mechanics, never growing old for me.\n\nDamrod and traps, sometimes.\n\nLeadership Boromir and the Gondor Leadership, ever lusting for support. Tactics Imrahil seems posed to help.\n\nI would like to say Haldir & Dúnhere assassin style but I can't seem to get them working properly.\n\nI used to like Lore Denethor and the whole spying thing but that has been a while.\n\nEdited July 6, 2016 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224306-most-fun-heroes-to-play/?do=findComment&comment=2297393","commentId":2297393,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1467792905,"content":"Galadriel.
