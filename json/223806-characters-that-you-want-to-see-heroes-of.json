Also, we could get his staff and maybe Glamdring (a regular attachment, this time). Besides, let us not forget that Saruman crafted a ring of his own, in “The Council of Elrond” Gandalf explains his absence to Frodo and others by relating how he was deceived and trapped by Saruman in Isengard in the Third Age year 3018. As part of his story Gandalf says:\n\n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> ‘Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall of rock; and it was strongly guarded. But the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode under the arch, and the gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though I knew no reason for it.\n> \n>  \n> \n> ‘But I rode to the foot of Orthanc, and came to the stair of Saruman and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber.

So Radagast said to me.”\n> \n>  \n> \n> `”Radagast the Brown! ” laughed Saruman, and he no longer concealed his scorn.\n> \n> “Radagast the Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple! Radagast the Fool! Yet he had just the wit to play the part that I set him. For you have come, and that was all the purpose of my message. And here you will stay, Gandalf the Grey, and rest from jourjourneys.
