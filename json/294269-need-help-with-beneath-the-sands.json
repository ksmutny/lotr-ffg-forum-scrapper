Try as I might I cannot beat this quest. I've played all sorts of decks 2 handed solo and single solo. I really want to beat it 2-handed but have no idea what decks will work. I've used decks of my own and from rings DB. \n\nI think it's harder than difficulty rating 5. \n\n \n\nCan anyone give me some pointers or list decks that are successful against this quest for me to try?\n\n \n\nThanks\n\nPHIL"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294269-need-help-with-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=3684769","commentId":3684769,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1555799737,"content":"You're in luck, I don't usually keep my decklists, but I do keep a quest log of all my plays at home 2-handed solo, wins and losses. That records the heroes I used, and I happened to have saved these two decks on ringsdb. I won in a single attempt. I'll link the two decks first:\n\nhttps://ringsdb.com/deck/view/54982 [https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/54982] (direct damage deck)\n\nhttps://ringsdb.com/deck/view/50636 [https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/50636] (willpower \"direct progress\" deck)\n\n \n\nAnd here is the writeup from my quest log:\n\nJune 17, 2017\n\nDanny played: Thalin, Mablung, and Argalad.\n\n2nd deck: Aragorn (Leadership), Arwen, and Lanwyn.\n\nLong game, 2 hours and change.  Played solo 2-handed.  I had a pair of decks meant to deal direct damage and direct progress, although the direct progress deck was mostly a willpower deck with progress effects peppered in.  Mostly it was blocked by the Blocked Passage encounter card effect.  During this game all possible encounter cards came out at least once.  All 3 side quests came out and were defeated.  The questing deck got set up faster than the damage deck, but both took a good long time to get set up.  I purposefully lingered on stage 2.  Dunedain Remedy did a good amount of healing, bouncing between Aragorn (with Steward) and Mablung.  The Brood Mother survived one round longer than needed to, because the On Track Forced effect failed to find me an \"On Track\" card, which meant the objective got flipped and I lost all progress on quest stage 3.  That made the spider immune to damage for another round.  I nearly lost a hero 1 turn as I did not have a defender and the attacker had 5 attack.  I used up Lanwyn's final resource as I planned to let her die, spending it on an Elven-light in the discard pile.  Lo and behold, this drew me a Sneak Attack, which I used to play Gandalf and kill off the enemy (which already had 1 or more damage on it).  The Brood Mother died with exactly the right number of damage -- if anything had gone wrong I would have gone 1 more round.  Good thing I didn't, too, as the damage deck had 48 threat at the end of the game.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294269-need-help-with-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=3684827","commentId":3684827,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1555806849,"content":"I used Noldor Mill for that entire cycle inc.

I played 3 games and lost them all. 😖\n\nThe deck itself was amazing with really good synergy. The twins were powerful and could hold off the brood spider with caregiver healing. \n\nGame one started grinding at the 3rd quest when I couldn't get the on track to flip. Lasted about 4 turns before I ran out of allies and that was the end. The second game again got stuck trying to flip the on track at the 3rd quest and lasted about 8 turns and went through the entire encounter deck but the on track cards would only appear for everything but the track test. Had to scoop to stop the inevitable grind to death. I had run out if cards in my deck and was just getting light of valinors back to use them on the imladris caregiver tonheal ellohir to defend against the brood spider boss. 3rd game I got a spider nest on the quest 1 reveal and a spider nest on the first encounter card for quest attempt one. I scooped with having only two spider nests in the staging area and only 3 heroes out. 6 threat if i dont travel and a brood spider boss if I do which would kill a hero turn 1 combat. \n\nI'm going to try the other two decks later in the week  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294269-need-help-with-beneath-the-sands/?do=findComment&comment=3691953","commentId":3691953,"userName":"asgardianphil","timestamp":1556567056,"content":"So I've played the two decks that Grandspleen kindly posted and I cant break the synergy that the encounter deck throws at me.

The top card of the quest deck is called the “main quest.”\n\nBut it is easy enough to get confused with some rules in this game, even after years of playing it."}]}
