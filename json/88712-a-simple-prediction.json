As I've said many times, the Lord of the Rings is not a world or a mere setting, it's a story, and as such you have to do stuff that plays on the books themselves. Now, of course that doesn't mean you are restricted to that story, and of course you can delve into the lore of other places and storylines and whatnot, as this game has been doing. Besides, there is so much stuff you can do in Middle Earth that I don't think that this will be over by the time the sagas are over. If they have the righs, they will obviously explore as much as they can since saga expansions are separate from the rest anyway. So I think we will see in the future stuff like the blue wizards, the unexplored far east or the far north, etc. There is no reason at all to stop the game once the sagas are done."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88712-a-simple-prediction/?do=findComment&comment=843598","commentId":843598,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1376845028,"content":"i think they'll continue to produce the game as long as it makes money.  If interest dwindles i wouldn't even necessarily guarantee we'll see the end of the lord of the rings, but if it continues to sell i see no reason why it wouldnt continue long after the saga expansions\n\nEdited August 18, 2013 by Pharmboys2013"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88712-a-simple-prediction/?do=findComment&comment=843600","commentId":843600,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1376845203,"content":"interesting question. one that is probably going to be answered more by sales and so on than for thematic reasons (unfortunatly)\n\n \n\nas you have said the difference between this and other lcg's is the story- it is quite simply, shorter. that isnt saying tolkiens work is less deep and rich becuase its the opposite. however much of tolkiens creations are in back stories, side tales, and legends that go far back in time.\n\n \n\nthis is in contrast to the likes of warhammer which is based in a conflict world which has always been open ended. they even get different authors to write the warhammer novels, and of course its largely based upon the battle minitures.\n\n \n\nthe other problem of course is that tolkien is unfortunatly long dead and not going to write any more material, and his son has not taken up the fiction-based story tellng of his father but rather gone down the historic path of tolkiens notes and drafts etc....totally useless for this game\n\n \n\nso i have typed 4 paragraphs there without answering your question, but i do not think we can at the moment\n\nrich\n\nEdited August 18, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88712-a-simple-prediction/?do=findComment&comment=843601","commentId":843601,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1376845217,"content":">  \n> \n> The big difference between LotR and the rest that you mention is that LotR is a very special story, and once the saga has ended it might feel a bit anti-climactic to go on with other quests.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Says you.

Most of the stories in the game I would say are invented, like rescuing the eagle in rhosgobel, fighting the trolls from the carrock (which I know is simialr to roast mutton, but its still not the same), or the steward's fear (based I suppose on the new shadow). They are loosely based on them but all the other stuff like the characters are invented or placed there for the story. For example, we know there was a asiege in Cair Andros at some point in the return of the king, but other than that we know nothing more about it, so I consider it to be a new story (there could have been many sieges on Cair Andros), and don't even get me started on Encounter at Amon Din, The Blood of Gondor or the Morgul Vale. Sure, the army of Gondor did go to the gates of Mordor near the end of the books, but that doesn't change the fact that this story about this Faramir rescuing bulls*** and these new enemies is in fact an original story, just because it's the same place.\n\n \n\nEDIT: tl;dr: If you look at the cycle's story as seen in the backs of the quest cards as a whole, they ARE original stories.\n\nEdited August 18, 2013 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88712-a-simple-prediction/?do=findComment&comment=843685","commentId":843685,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1376853323,"content":"Ok, so how do you imagine the storyline after the saga (for the Lord of the Rings, mind you - as you say) go? \"Well, there was once this really evil guy, he's now gone, but that doesn't meant we should stop fearing him?\" That doesn't make much sense to me.\n\nEdited August 18, 2013 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88712-a-simple-prediction/?do=findComment&comment=843694","commentId":843694,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1376854465,"content":"> as you have said the difference between this and other lcg's is the story- it is quite simply, shorter. that isnt saying tolkiens work is less deep and rich becuase its the opposite. however much of tolkiens creations are in back stories, side tales, and legends that go far back in time.\n> \n>  \n> \n> so i have typed 4 paragraphs there without answering your question, but i do not think we can at the moment\n> \n> rich\n\n \n\nWell I think you did anyway :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] that's what I wanted confirmed, that there might be enough to go back on after the saga ends :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n> > The big difference between LotR and the rest that you mention is that LotR is a very special story, and once the saga has ended it might feel a bit anti-climactic to go on with other quests.\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > Says you.

There is not a defined order of storylines in this game besides the saga expansions (and of course the stories from a deluxe expansion to the end of the cycle), just random adventures in random places, to put it bluntly. The cycles themselves are not interconnected (there's no real storyline order from Mirkwood cycle to Dwarrodelf to ATS) and could take place at pretty much any time of the War of the Ring and before it. So besides the saga expansions, I don't feel this game has much of a sotryline connectineg everything, so I would not mind (in fact I wish they did) if they explore different locations in new cycles that don't deal directly with Sauron (such as, for example, a mission to Harad to ask for aid to the blue wizards or maybe going northwest to reclaim lost treasure, etc) And those storylines could take place either during the War of the Ring meanwhile Frodo goes to Mordor, or before it or even after it. I think that's the whole point of the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88712-a-simple-prediction/?do=findComment&comment=843725","commentId":843725,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1376857137,"content":"To me, the Saga Expansions are separate from the \"main game\".

I kind of feel the same way. I feel that the saga boxes are their own game, only, they ARE part of the total card pool. Difficult to explain. If at some point there's enough \"side quests\" to combine into a bigger adventure and eventually a saga box or a full set of saga boxes, then cool. If not, then the game has three sub games for me.

But if you read my post again, you'll see that I also said that it shouldn't be restricted only to the Lord of the Rings. That means I agree and hope that we will see stuff further from the main trilogy, but that we should at least have the trilogy itself in the game. Also, I think you should read the posts that argue that the next quests shouldn't necessarily take place after the Lord of the Rings, as i've said. Many if not most of them take place in an ambiguous \"Thrid Age\" scenario, which means they can take place before, during or (depending on the place) after the Lord of the Rings, since it's not really stated in the product and they're not really linked to anything besides their own cycle. So it's not like after the last saga expansion every cycle will take place after the fall of Sauron.\n\n \n\nWhat I meant by \"says you\", is that it's not necessarily the case that it will be anti-climatic for people to have more quests after the saga expansions. In fact most people seem to agree and welcome the possibility of there being more quests after them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88712-a-simple-prediction/?do=findComment&comment=844640","commentId":844640,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1376944686,"content":"I'm hopeful that we will see continuing adventures once the Saga boxes end. I got the definite impression back when Over Hill & Under Hill was announced that Saga expansions are 'aside' from the main game. I can't quite pin this down in the initial announcement, but the phrase \n\n \n\nWhile standard expansions imagine new and untold stories in Middle-earth, this Saga Expansion allows players to participate directly in the events from the beloved fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien\n\n \n\ndefinitely sets it apart for me. The saga expansion is an event, an expansion within the stream of expansions. Taken in that way, for me, it seems odd to think that the game would end with the defeat of Sauron, because the Sagas don't dictate the course of the game, these 'standard expansions' do. Also, the fact that these standard boxes are imagining new and untold stories in the familiar setting strikes a particularly resonant chord for me as a Star Wars fan, drawing a strong parallel with the expanded universe there. In that respect, Star Wars is six movies surrounded by over a hundred novels and even more comics, and has been massively successful. In this sense, this game is Middle Earth's equivalent, as we see other stuff that was happening. Just because Frodo was off to Mount Doom didn't mean the rest of Middle Earth stood still - there is scope for far more adventures to be set concurrently with the 'main' timeline. I actually have no idea when the Against the Shadow cycle is supposed to be set, but have no problem imagining it happening at the same time as Frodo is approaching Bree, for example. Denethor isn't going to be sat in that empty hall waiting for his cue to join the story, after all. \n\n \n\nI'm assuming, though, that the saga boxes will be spread out. Taking recent history as the pattern, I'm assuming we'll be getting one saga box released in the Autumn, then the other in February(ish), with the deluxe falling somewhere in between and the next cycle taking up the most part of the year. So we should be seeing the final saga box, assuming six to tell the story of the whole Lord of the Rings, in or around February 2016. Then perhaps, we'll see a pattern of two cycles being released per year, or thereabouts, with deluxe expansions at the appropriate points. But all that is based on my own conjecture!\n\n \n\nHowever, as has already been mentioned, it's far more likely that sales will drive the continuance of this game rather than constraints in the lore. It is also entirely natural to suppose that there will be a falling-off of sales once the King has returned, though to what degree will remain to be seen. I'd like to think that, by that time, whoever casually bought into this game because of the lure of the actual LotR storyline from the saga boxes will be hooked and will continue to snap up every adventure pack, but I'm biased. In this respect, then, I can entirely see this game changing direction to match Warhammer and Call of Cthulhu, and going to quarterly or even four-monthly expansion boxes. And I think I'd be happy with that (not only because I usually end up buying four of the deluxe expansions for the encounter sets). As it stands, we get nine quests per year for the 'main/standard game' anyway, so having a four-monthly release schedule wouldn't disrupt that whatsoever. Player cards would slow down, of course, but people have already discussed the now-dwindling stable of characters that remain to see their card forms, so moving to this release schedule would also solve that issue, to some degree. By the time 2016 rolls around, though, we should have a pretty **** good player card-base, anyway. Provided that we continue to have solid quests with good narrative focus and high levels of theme, I'm happy  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88712-a-simple-prediction/?do=findComment&comment=844648","commentId":844648,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1376945172,"content":"> I actually have no idea when the Against the Shadow cycle is supposed to be set, but have no problem imagining it happening at the same time as Frodo is approaching Bree, for example.
