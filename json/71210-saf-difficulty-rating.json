One of us were NEVER attacked by the Balrog. The game lasted no more than 5 rounds and a few minutes (I really don't have a good time notion when playing). Gimli decimated the Balrog and then, we used the refresh action to win the game. Some nasty treacheries were revealed, but Thalin wasn't used very much since very few enemies were revealed.\n\n \n\nMaybe we did something wrong, but I can't find what it was.\n\n \n\nAnyone else had this experience?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71210-saf-difficulty-rating/?do=findComment&comment=695492","commentId":695492,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1347906853,"content":"how did the balrog never attack any of you?\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71210-saf-difficulty-rating/?do=findComment&comment=695496","commentId":695496,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1347907426,"content":"richsabre said:\n\n \n\nhow did the balrog never attack any of you?\n\nrich\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nONE of us.\nHe only attacks people with 1 or higher threat.\n\nhttp://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_nori-ohauh.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_nori-ohauh.jpg]\n\n \n\n \n\nEDIT: Also, Feint."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71210-saf-difficulty-rating/?do=findComment&comment=695508","commentId":695508,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1347908171,"content":" sounds ok as long as you realized that the balrog couldnt be attacked by the player who kept his threat at zero unless he willingly engaged it and allowed himself to be attacked.\n\nas with any of the \"boss\" quests, its easier with more people.  I havent played SaF with 3 people but ive only beat it once with two people (in about 5 attempts) and havent beat it ever solo (in about 8 attempts)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71210-saf-difficulty-rating/?do=findComment&comment=695530","commentId":695530,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1347910062,"content":"Pharmboys2013 said:\n\n sounds ok as long as you realized that the balrog couldnt be attacked by the player who kept his threat at zero unless he willingly engaged it and allowed himself to be attacked.\n\nYep.
