From p.16 of the rules:\n\n\"Whether an enemy is engaged through an engagement check, through a card effect, or through a player’s choice, the end result is the same, with the enemy\nand the player engaging one another. In all cases, the player is considered to have engaged the enemy and the enemy is considered to have engaged the player.\"\n\nSo, whenever you engage an enemy, it also engages you. That's why a puny monster like the Hummerhorns is worth 5 victory points.\n "}]}
