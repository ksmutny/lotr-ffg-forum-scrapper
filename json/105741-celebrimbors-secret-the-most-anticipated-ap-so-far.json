As it is now, Silvan allies are often 3-cost but the new ones shall be 2-cost it seems, which will make it easier even without some sort of resource acceleration. Celeborn is Leadership, so he can get to some tricks. If you have Bifur as the third hero, you can play Gaining Strength on round 1 and have three resources on him -- not bad either.

Well, I stop ranting now...\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nYou're right it all depends on the length the game goes. It's also a shame (I feel) that many people are so reluctant to have errata in this game compared to any competitive game.\n\nThey wouldn't bother taking out traits that were dead (healer, archer) because they're not effecting anything - but it may be that as they start to develop these traits they realize they're useful and they haven't maintained them. (We have plenty of ranged characters that aren't archers, and plenty of healers that aren't healer).\n\nAll games of this scope have problems at release - the most successful (Magic) gets around it by just having all cards become obsolete - meaning that if they do make a mistake it doesn't effect the main formats of the game for too long. I think they had pretty good foresight to include everything they did in the core set.\n\nThen during the first cycle they dropped some of the stuff that wasn't currently useful (archer trait) - and now they can't really do anything with it without errating the archer trait back in to a whole host of cards. (Although it wouldn't necessarily need to be added to heroes - it could be kept as an ally thing).\n\nRanged and archer could have been distinct - Vassal of the Windlord has ranged (the ability to attack at range) but not with a bow (so if we got an ally bow attachment that could only be used on... archers that's why you need the trait :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]). Even Ithilian Archer doesn't have the archer trait though, so it's highly unlikely that they could use the trait without it being disjointed now.\n\nLooking at the cards that don't have archer though, they might be able to salvage the trait by having it be archers in an army (thematically) rather than anyone that can use a bow - but still."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105741-celebrimbors-secret-the-most-anticipated-ap-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1084172","commentId":1084172,"userName":"ana4","timestamp":1400065387,"content":"Yes, that is what I thought about the Archer -- that it could be a unit in an army. So far I think only Horseback Archer (Rohan) and Silverlode Archer (Silvan) has it. We can see a Minas Tirith Archer (Gondor), Rivendell Archer (Noldor), etc. and get a nice mechanic for a battle type situation. It would have to be distinctively different from the ranged keyword, I say.\n\n \n\nI really cannot think what the Healer can do, I am totally puzzled why he was selected as one of the four in the saga. Elrond, probably the most famous healer of the age, did not get the trait. Similar with the Minstrel, Rivendell Minstrel is missing it but the new Galadhrim Minstrel (spoilt in the Dunland Trap article) is not. Interesting. And the Craftsman, I feel they could save that one easily."}]}
