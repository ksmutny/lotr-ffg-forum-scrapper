I am guessing it is the first one, but wanted to get opinions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51015-caught-in-a-web-question/?do=findComment&comment=509530","commentId":509530,"userName":"Voldigar","timestamp":1312559359,"content":"I'm with option A. Makes for a nasty \"debuff\", but seems to be the clearest reading of the card.
