If my guess is correct and they do leave out Old Forest it will be disappointing.\n\nAnother thing that is bugging me is the artwork.\nIndividually, all the artwork on card are very excellent.\nBut looking at the spoiled cards, the artwork is just everywhere and styles don't match each other.\nSome cards look 'pretty', some look 'D&D fantasy', some look 'fairytale-ish', some look 'comicbook-ish', and overall they look like combination of arts from different games. A little of consistency in style of art used would be nice.\n \n\nBut yeah, the game seems to be getting better and better with new Easy, Standard, Nightmare Modes, Reward/Punishment for Campaign Mode, and promise of more Saga expansions to come.\n\n \n\nAssuming we will be finished with Against the Shadow Cycle by the time Black Rider Saga comes out (they said 3rd quarter, which I would assume means september), I'm betting next Cycle will be located around Sarn Ford and focused on Dunedain Ranger / Hobbits to synergize with Saga expasions to develope those keywords further."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795516","commentId":795516,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1368558163,"content":"Raven1015 said:\n\nAgreed, so much good stuff, the designers are on fire.\n\n \n\nCan I just say….Barliman Butterbur's in the house!!!\n\n\n\ni thought the consensus on these forums was that this game was dead and the designers don't care about the game? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795522","commentId":795522,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1368559063,"content":"Dain Ironfoot said:\n\nRaven1015 said:\n\n \n\nAgreed, so much good stuff, the designers are on fire.\n\n \n\nCan I just say….Barliman Butterbur's in the house!!!\n\n \n\n \n\ni thought the consensus on these forums was that this game was dead and the designers don't care about the game? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n\n\n \n\nHehe, not so much a consensus as an opinion held by a few vocal people."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795524","commentId":795524,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1368559223,"content":"Raven1015 said:\n\nDain Ironfoot said:\n\n \n\nRaven1015 said:\n\n \n\nAgreed, so much good stuff, the designers are on fire.\n\n \n\nCan I just say….Barliman Butterbur's in the house!!!\n\n \n\n \n\ni thought the consensus on these forums was that this game was dead and the designers don't care about the game? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHehe, not so much a consensus as an opinion held by a few vocal people.\n\n\n\noh, i know. but i couldn't help but rub it in a bit. haha."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=795526","commentId":795526,"userName":"Alex6222","timestamp":1368559342,"content":"Oh my so much amazing things to buy.

As much as I love all the original stories that have come out of the quests so far, there is something ridiculously fun about playing the actual book of The Hobbit, so I'm really looking forward to more of that here! I've always liked the journey to Rivendell from this book, there's something innocent about it that really pleases me. And Weathertop, for a reason I can't quite explain, has long been my favourite location in pretty much the whole saga, so I'm looking forward to that! \n\nBoons and Burdens sound excellent. Something that pleased me much about The Steward's Fear was the Plots mechanic, which seems to be indicative of more emphasis on story-telling than on just killing stuff. As fun as the treasures were, I didn't think all that much to them in actual gameplay terms. Collecting Boons sounds like a much better idea of showing how your adventure has changed you. \n\n \n\nPharmboys2013 said:\n\n(considering the first 2 quests were kind of already covered in the darrowdelf cycle, maybe the 1st will be moria (they cant avoid it) and the 2nd will be a more original quest about making it to Lothlorien)\n\n\n\nConsidering The Hobbit boxes essentially re-made Conflict at the Carrock and Passage through Mirkwood, it wouldn't surprise me to see Moria yet again, issues of the fact it's in the book aside! The Hobbit re-made them better, though, so even though they're the same, essentially, they still feel different enough that I'd have no problem with going back into Moria. I just hope it's the one quest, though, and not given too much focus.\n\nEllareth said:\n\nAnother thing that is bugging me is the artwork.\n\nIndividually, all the artwork on card are very excellent.\nBut looking at the spoiled cards, the artwork is just everywhere and styles don't match each other.\nSome cards look 'pretty', some look 'D&D fantasy', some look 'fairytale-ish', some look 'comicbook-ish', and overall they look like combination of arts from different games.

I can't wait for this set. I love this part of the book, it's so atmospheric and creepy. No mention of Barrow Wights or the Old Forest though?\n\nThis may sound crazy but the other Hobbit hero (after Sam, Merry and Fatty) could be Rosie. A lot of people have been clamouring for more female heroes so its possible.\n\nAll the heroes are hobbits, but I wonder if Aragorn, Glorfindel or Gildor will get any specific mention? I know some people have complained that some heroes have received too much attention but I think that Aragorn specifically is one of the few characters in the book that fits perfectly into each sphere. It seems from from all the attachments he was given that the intention was to make him a man of all spheres. I think this was a good idea, I know others disagree.\n\nHaving said that Lore Aragorn (artwork and ability) will fit perfectly with this set, and it seems clear from the cards that Rangers may be a specific benefit.\n\nI think two boxes per book is likely, but not certain. It could easily be three. One dealing with the journey over the misty mountains, the other with Lothlorien, Anduin etc. The second fellowship book has so many individual adventures.\n\nNew Legolas and Gimli next box? Yes! Maybe Anduril too for Aragorn? A new Gandalf ally or even hero? Galadriel for certain. There is a lot to be excited about. It will be so good to play these adventures accurately, with the full fellowship.\n\nDo people think they will do a cycle inbetween saga instalments, like they did with the hobbit? I.e one per year?

I wanted this so badly that, when I collected the Decipher CCG I tried in vain to build a sneaky hobbit deck from day one. This was unfortunate, as the hobbit race (each faction was its own little sphere, usually divided by race, but sometimes subdivided by country) was neglected time and again until the very end of the game. By then, however, all the other races were so powerful, only blind stupid incompetency in my opponents would allow my Sam, Bilbo, Frodo, Pip & M “Sting” deck win. I don’t learn very well, because as soon as I discovered that there was a secrecy mechanic coming out, I started organizing my game to accommodate the new cards. It goes without saying that my decks really stank. The Secrecy mechanic was (I assume) abandoned as cumbersome & my dream of sneaking slowly faded. Many times have I, when espying the tantalizing spoiler for an upcoming release, chatted my LoTR Captains Facebook page about how this time there is a chance for secrecy! This time, with the Twins!

Sorry, I don't think so, and here's why.\n\nI've seen Rosie Cotton & Bilbo Baggins & Bullroarer Took mentioned in ths thread, but Bullroarer to my knowlegde is dead by this time. (so NO way he'll show up. Bilbo is already in rivendell as he left when he gave the ring to frodo; and these saga expensions really follow the books so Bilbo, I think is out. Then there's Rosie…nice idea..but I don't see her popping up as a hero until the scouring of the shire chapter, when she starts playing a role really.\n\nhere's my thoughts of the 4 hobbit heroes: (following saga i.e. the book)\n\n1. Tactics: farmer maggot -> he stood firm (with 3 of his hounds) against a black rider. no other hobbit in this part of the book seems to fit taictics any better than maggot's deeds helping the hobbit's escape detection. And if they don't implant him here in the saga, where then?\n\n2. Lore: samwise -> he loves elvish lore and in this part of the book he goes on about them. I believe later on in the saga we will see a spirit and tactics sam with high willpower in the mordor stage against shelob & on mount doom. (along with a gollum hero mind you)\n\n3. Spirit: fatty bolger -> the only reason I add him here is of the simple fact that he won't be able to show up anywhere else in the saga. I know, he left early because of fear, which gives him low willpower, but not all spirit heroes need high willpower; maybe fatty will get a good abiltiy? Just a hunch…\n\n4.

So it is likely that we allso see other heroes in here. Early story heroes include Aragorn definitely.\n\nAfter we get to the Rivendel, we will get Legolas, Gimli and Boromir again… Hard to say if we see others… It is possible though, but I would not bet on them… Gandalf would be one, but he seems somewhat hard to balance hero, unles his treath cost is something like 30-40… or his abilities has to be really weak, So Gandalf Ally is more likely, but it is not impossible to see Gandalf as an hero. Maybe we can run solo Frodo + Gandalf decks :-)\n\nGlorfinder is possible, because he appears in the Road and saves the day in Bruinen (instead or Arven that was put in his shoes in the movies). Barliman is another, but same problem as with Fatty… not very active in books. Maybe as an lore character? Hmmm… Not so many characters in the beginning of the book. Tom and Coldberry, but better as an objectives or in event cards… And most propably we skip them again… It would be really nice to see some seriously sexy Goldberry as an card, but not likely to happen… Farmer Maggot was mentioned and he is a good candidate to an hobbit, maybe even better than Fatty. Maybe some unnamed ranger as an adjuntant to Aragorn. Later there are good candidates more. Like a hero version of Faramir in the Ithilien part and so on…\n\nBecause this expansion is a stand alone with core (Like Hobbit expansions vere), we will definitely see new Pippin, even one version is coming out in other expansion. Core set offers Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas (+ Gandalf) so what we most propably get are Pippin, Merry, Sam and Boromir, so that we will have the full Fellowship. The next best bet is a hero Version of Gandalf to this group… just interesting to see if he is a worth of putting in the deck as an hero… The ally version is so good!\n\nGandalf - a friend of Shire folk\nthreat cost 25\nWillpower 4\nAttack strengh 4\nDefence Strength 4\nHit points 4\nIstari\nGains one multisphere resource token in the beginning of each round.

Pippin for example, more or less relies on only taking him with Hobbits.\n\nThe new outlands hero likewise, only works at all in an outlands deck (which is also so amazing that if you ever include him, you're essentially commiitting to \"the\" outlands strategy).\n\n \n\nAlthough I don't like the forced outlands theme (because it's too strong, and too inflexibile) I am looking forward to the hobbit theme - and honestly I don't think Sam having to be taken with Frodo is appreciabily more restrictive than say, Dain forcing you into the dwarf theme. Especially if Sam is designed to work withthe Frodo that we get in the Black Riders (Since he comes from that set).\n\nIf you prefer however, Sam could have a similar ability to Pippin - one that works when you only control Hobbit heroes (Which is still themetically accurate, at all stages of the story, since the hobbits always stuck together when they could and drew strength from their kinship). This wouldn't be any different from a dwarf theme, and in fact would be pretty similar to how the dwarfs were done (With some working outside the theme, the way Frodo and Bilbo do, and some working only in the theme, such as Dain or any dwarf hero with a rule about controlling 5 dwarfs).\n\n \n\nThis game really needs to focus on other themes (Besides dwarf) to help control deck building and allow continued card development - \"Hobbit\" is clearly the next big one (getting some love in the gondor cycle in the form of pippin, as well as being the obvious focus for the start of the next saga expansions). Hobbit will probably outstrip Gondor by the time Black Riders is out. We already know (based on spoiled cards and pack one) that while the current cycle is set in Gondor, it doesn't exclusively support that theme. (for example we have a hobbit, an outlands and a rohan hero spoiled… to go with two gondor heros from the deluex expansion).\n\nI think that the hobbit theme will expand rapidly and will require some of the heroes in black rider to be hobbit theme focused. (I'm expecting a second version of Pippin in the box, maybe he won't be hobbit only, if that is the only Sam hero we get, he definitely should be hobbit rather than generic focused).\n\nAlthough a generic Sam that can search for food items is a great idea (it requires a lot more \"food\" in the game)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83870-black-rider/?do=findComment&comment=798892","commentId":798892,"userName":"klaymen_sk","timestamp":1369478248,"content":"Rapier said:\n\nWe already know (based on spoiled cards and pack one) that while the current cycle is set in Gondor, it doesn't exclusively support that theme.
