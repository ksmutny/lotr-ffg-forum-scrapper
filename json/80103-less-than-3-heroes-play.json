This deck allows you to play the expensive lore allies quickly and it uses all the synergies that a dwarf deck offers to you. If you can play one of the cheap lore dwarf allies on turn 1, you already have 5 WP and a good defender."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80103-less-than-3-heroes-play/?do=findComment&comment=769172","commentId":769172,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1362202945,"content":"I just made a two hero tactics deck of Legolas and Beregond, to support a heavy questing deck of Eowyn, Glorfindel, and Elrond.  It works really well. the tactics main goal is to defend and destroy enimies.  I have only tried it on JDtA, CaTC, and ITP,  which it was sucessful on all three.  Not sure how it would hold up on HoN and Hobbit Scenarions.  I actually started this deck off as a one hero deck with only legolas, and had some victories, but I had no defender for him, and occasionaly an enemy would slip in.  So, Beregond was the solution, and with sentinel he would defend the questing heroes too.  If I can, both Legolas and Beregond will get Unexpected Courage with Beregong getting it first.  The deck is pretty much built around events and attachments with some eagle allies.  My idea for the deck was to center around The Great Yew Bow, and trying to keep threat down in both decks, and it works some of the time.  I'm really liking the deck.  I need to tweek the questing deck a bit more to make even more specialized for it's task.

If either of them have unexpected courage. That's all the better and then they can handle multiple enemies.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80103-less-than-3-heroes-play/?do=findComment&comment=769241","commentId":769241,"userName":"Nizi","timestamp":1362222384,"content":"Theoretically it sounds like a bad idea, but maybe someone made it work.
