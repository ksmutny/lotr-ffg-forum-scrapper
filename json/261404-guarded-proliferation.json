Next I reveal one card to guard the first objective with the keyword surge ( I hate Eastern Crows !) so I reveal another card, putting it in the staging area. At the end I reveal a card to guard the second objective. 5 cards in a row!\n\nHave i play in the right way?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/261404-guarded-proliferation/?do=findComment&comment=3039228","commentId":3039228,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1508687275,"content":"Yes you are right.
