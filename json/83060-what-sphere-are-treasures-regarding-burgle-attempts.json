For the Burgle attempt to be a success I have to discard 1 card from my hand that matches the revealed card's sphere and type.\n\nMy question is what is Glamdring's (and all other Treasures') sphere? As far as I know there isn't really a Treasure sphere nor are Treasure cards considered to be Baggins sphere. Are they neutral? I have another Treasure card in my hand that I could discard in order to have a successful Burgle attempt but I wasn't sure if that would satisfy the condition.\n\n \n\nThoughts? help?\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83060-what-sphere-are-treasures-regarding-burgle-attempts/?do=findComment&comment=789819","commentId":789819,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1367173686,"content":"as far as i know they have no sphere, so basically its a bad draw\n\nrich"}]}
