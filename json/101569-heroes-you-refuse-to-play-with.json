It's not that I refuse to play them. It's more that there abilites are mostly related to multi player game. There are a bunch of Dwarves that also fall into this category. I think Dwalin is the worst of them. Reducing threat by 2 for destroying an orc is cool but, starting with 2 attack means he needs tactics attachments to even damage most orcs let alone destroy them. Glorfindel Lore is one that is never sees much use any more, althogh I did build some sucessful decks with him early on, now him and his ability are pretty much useless.\n\nOn certain scenarios some of these heroes might be useful, but I don't think I'll ever get much use out of Bard and Brand. Faramir also falls into this category, but I did make a Gondor deck with him that worked okay to get some use out of him.\n\nAlso, these heroes might be revived as new player cards emerge.\n\nAwhile ago my list would have included spirit pippin, fatty, and caldera, but I have built some very fun and good decks with them.

That, plus his ability to pay for allies of every sphere significantly lowers the degree of difficulty. \n\n \n\nI think I'm almost to that point with Spirit Glorfindel as well. It's almost more fun to try and build solo decks WITHOUT him than with him. I already know I can build a killer deck using Spirfindel, Spirit Frodo, and Loragorn. It's more fun to try other stuff out.\n\n \n\nThis is also mitigated by the fact that one of the guys I play with regularly refuses to play anything BUT his favorite deck---Spirfindel, Elrond, and Legolas. So I'd constantly have to be reconfiguring my decks between solo and multiplay anyway if I was using Elrond and Spirfindel. \n\n \n\nMy next challenge is to build a thematic \"princes\" deck around Faramir, Eomer, and Imrahil. I've also wanted to do a \"Heroes of Ithilien\" deck using Eowyn, Faramir, and Beregond.

For example, in the former, you can raise your threat when you fall a bit short during an important quest push, say a few progress tokens shy of clearing out a crucial location or quest stage, thus moving you closer to victory. In the latter, a Hobbit deck with a low starting threat can take one for the team, preventing all players from failing questing or pushing everyone closer to where they need to be. It’s helpful to re-state this ability in different terms to really think about whether it’s useful or not. If Fatty Bolger instead said, “Action: Raise your threat by X to put X progress tokens on the quest,” would you view this as valuable? I’d have to say the answer is a clear yes, although Fatty’s ability doesn’t quite work this simply, as it is dependent on the threat strength of available enemies in the staging area, and this serves as an important limiting factor. Still, the point stands.\n> \n> Is exhausting a hero and raising threat really an efficient alternative to a Radagast's cunning/Secret paths? I don't think so.\n\nYea ok, end discussion right here. You could have rolled over like a good cow and said: \"ok mr. camel, I'm on my back, Spippin sux\"\n\nYou actually brought the fatty vs Spippin thing up in the first place, where Spippin clearly sux more.\n\nYet instead you choose to wriggle into some non-sense Fatty bashing. Do you hate fatties? Do you? DO YOU?\n\nWhat does another sphere's cards have to do with this? Nothing. That's what.\n\nI could start to compare Spippin to any other random card here and now too. But I won't, as it breaks the debate.\n\n(And also because most random cards are better then Spippin.)\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a fatty mind you ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nEdited March 21, 2014 by Noccus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101569-heroes-you-refuse-to-play-with/?do=findComment&comment=1020995","commentId":1020995,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1395397606,"content":"The problem of Brand is that he is exclusively for multiplayer, while most players are solo ones."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101569-heroes-you-refuse-to-play-with/?do=findComment&comment=1021002","commentId":1021002,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1395398039,"content":"> The problem of Brand is that he is exclusively for multiplayer, while most players are solo ones.\n\nThat fact doesn't make him suck.\n\nIt just means he's designed for multi player.\n\nAnd these days I hear a lot of players saying they play 2 handed solo.\n\nThey should give Brand a try.\n\nBrand + Rohan warhorse = ready heroes :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101569-heroes-you-refuse-to-play-with/?do=findComment&comment=1021003","commentId":1021003,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1395398161,"content":">  \n> \n> > The problem of Brand is that he is exclusively for multiplayer, while most players are solo ones.\n> \n> That fact doesn't make him suck.\n> \n> It just means he's designed for multi player.\n> \n> And these days I hear a lot of players saying they play 2 handed solo.\n> \n> They should give Brand a try.\n> \n> Brand + Rohan warhorse = ready heroes :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n> \n>  \n\nNever said he sux ballz.

Brand is definitely a niche hero, given that his ability only works in multi-player. That said, he is amazing in his niche, especially now that the Warhorse and Merry can join in on the killing spree. Certainly, pure solo players won't give him a second look, and that is fine. But he is by no means a \"weak\" or \"bad\" hero, you just need to use him in his niche.\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, Spirit Pippin is just bad. I have tried him in several decks and his ability just doesn't work. Any of the combos that you would want to do around returning enemies to the staging area involve two key elements: non-Hobbit heroes (printed ranged keyword, Faramir, etc.) and keeping your threat low to avoid enemy engagement. The fact the Pippin's ability specifically kills both of these strategies is why he is such a poor design. I am not saying that you cannot make a decent deck with him, a threat cost of 6 opens up the potential for a decent Secrecy deck. The point is that his ability is garbage and doesn't work within any of the existing Hobbit archetypes. Sure you can just use him as a low-cost quester, but this is not a very good argument for him being a good hero. Think of it this way, how many times would you rather have Spirit Frodo for 1 more threat? Every single time would be my answer.\n\n \n\nI like the new Hobbit archetype around optional engagement, and I think the heroes in The Black Riders are really well designed. I just don't ever see Spirit Pippin being anything but a curiosity. Just one bear's opinion, but it is based on my own experiences trying to make his ability useful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101569-heroes-you-refuse-to-play-with/?do=findComment&comment=1022101","commentId":1022101,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1395452498,"content":"I've made one deck with Pippin in a mono-spirit hobbit that was somewhat fun to play.  The whole strategy was about avoiding enemy attacks.  It worked on a limited number of quests.
