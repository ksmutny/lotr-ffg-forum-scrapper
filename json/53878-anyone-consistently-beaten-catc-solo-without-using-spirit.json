This quest is all about preparation. Everyone loves Spirit because of its threat management, but there are no bonus points for having low threat. Simply use the Gandalfs to keep threat at a comfortable level and get it below 34 before advancing. Use the card draw abilities of Lore matched with the resource generation of Leadership and you can almost play your deck at will after a few rounds. Also, after some buffing, Theodred can do most questing on his own. When he needs help you can use Imrahil, chump block with a small ally, and then use Imrahil again to attack.\n\nSmall combo note: this is the first AP in which I used Forest Snare to grab one of the big unique trolls (10 hit points). I hit him for 9 and then used Infighting to transfer these wounds to Hill Trolls in the staging area and collect the victory points without engaging them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53878-anyone-consistently-beaten-catc-solo-without-using-spirit/?do=findComment&comment=534404","commentId":534404,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1317249987,"content":"Puzzle said:\n\nSmall combo note: this is the first AP in which I used Forest Snare to grab one of the big unique trolls (10 hit points).

In fact, those progress removers are a blessing, buying you more time during the first stage to build up. We cleared all 4x River Langfloods during the first stage, only thing giving concern was threat level, we only really had 2x Gandalf each for reduction. I barely was able to take the extra threat from that one Troll's ability while taking on two Uniques, but we won."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53878-anyone-consistently-beaten-catc-solo-without-using-spirit/?do=findComment&comment=534493","commentId":534493,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1317278751,"content":" Lot's of good stuff, thanks guys!

Basically, we would mostly quest with her and Thalin, discarding for her ability if needed, otherwise only matching Threat in staging area + progress needed on the active location, thus clearing a location per turn, travelling to the next one. That up to +2 WP is great for managing threat vs WP, which is very important during stage 1 of CatC."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53878-anyone-consistently-beaten-catc-solo-without-using-spirit/?do=findComment&comment=534589","commentId":534589,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1317293361,"content":"Narsil0420 said:\n\nI like this quest because Spirit seems like the worst sphere to use against it!

Until recently I haven't really tried to track a certain deck, but just threw together something each time with 66% of the dominant sphere and 33% of the other. (I only have 1 core set) For the Three Hunters deck I did the same using 66% Tactics cards and the rest Leadership, except I will usually include more Leadership cards with the hope of getting Steward out on Aragorn. I know that I didn't use any Spirit cards but I may have slipped in the two Galadhrim's Greetings to hopefully use with Celebrian's Stone. But really you don't need them, especially with Born Aloft and Gandalf as a combo. Low questing ability doesn't really matter with Carrock. The key is just to take your sweet time building up your allies and attachments to turn the Three Hunters into troll smashers. I don't even worry about the threat level unless it starts getting into the mid forties.\n\nWhen I used this deck, it was the first time I beat Carrock solo and at the time I didn't know that Louis makes ALL the troll raise your threat by three when they attack, so you want to make sure your threat is not above 36 or so when they attack (unless you have a couple Feints up your sleeve) and also have a couple uses of Gandalf ready to go.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nMatt"}]}
