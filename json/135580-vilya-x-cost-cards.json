Can you play them for any cost X? For example,\n\nVilya.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Shadow-and-Flame/Vilya.png]                       Stand-and-Fight.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Core-Set/Stand-and-Fight.png]\n\n \n\nCould I play stand and fight by Vilya to return the Beorn ally of cost 6? Or is it revealed as X equal to 0, which would make it complete useless since the only 0 cost allies have to be released yet."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135580-vilya-x-cost-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1459367","commentId":1459367,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1424592854,"content":"The latter appears to be correct (http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/73055-elrond-vilya/?hl=vilya [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/73055-elrond-vilya/?hl=vilya]). This seems logical/reasonable to me.\n\n \n\nThe FAQ states the following:\n\n \n\n(1.40) The letter X\nUnless specified by a card effect, or granted player\nchoice, the letter \"X\" is equal to 0.\n \nBut… perhaps you could pay 6 Resources to put Beorn into play from your discard pile when Vilya puts Stand and Fight into play? That's the only way I could see it working. \n \nI could be wrong, and I'm sure wiser/more experienced players will chime in."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135580-vilya-x-cost-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1459421","commentId":1459421,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1424602268,"content":"I knew the letter X equals 0 in most cases, but the \"granted player choice\" makes it confusing to me. Since If i get the choice of playing an ally of cost X by the event, X would be specified and thereby 6.
