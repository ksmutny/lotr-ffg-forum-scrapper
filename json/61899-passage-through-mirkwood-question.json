Or do you just win?\n\n \n\nThanks for the help!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61899-passage-through-mirkwood-question/?do=findComment&comment=606142","commentId":606142,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1331834048,"content":"sorry....you have to go again :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61899-passage-through-mirkwood-question/?do=findComment&comment=606209","commentId":606209,"userName":"helmsdeep88","timestamp":1331851620,"content":"That's what I thought.\n\nBummer. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\nThanks for the help :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61899-passage-through-mirkwood-question/?do=findComment&comment=606281","commentId":606281,"userName":"cuber3","timestamp":1331876551,"content":"I played this quest around 4 times so far and every time I got lucky and drew the other path.

In Conflict at the Carrock, you face 4 Unique Trolls at the end and if you kill them, they go to the discard pile (since they aren't worth VP). Since the quest requires that no Trolls can be in play in order to win, it is possible to kill the Unique Trolls, have the encounter deck run out, reshuffle and get them back into play, forcing you to kill them again. Same for the Nazgul in Dol Guldur and WK in Osgiliath."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61899-passage-through-mirkwood-question/?do=findComment&comment=720204","commentId":720204,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1352321934,"content":"Like Dam said, there is no \"memory.\"  There is only the discard pile, the victory display, and the encounter deck, and so forth.  Defeating a monster can fulfill a condition in order to flip a Quest card, but you don't keep track of defeats anywhere.\n\nThink of it this way: if the quest card said, \"The players must complete one turn in order to finish the game,\" you would go ahead and complete the next turn, right?  Even though you've already completed several turns previously.  It is a condition that must be fulfilled after it has been revealed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61899-passage-through-mirkwood-question/?do=findComment&comment=720244","commentId":720244,"userName":"Vase","timestamp":1352327772,"content":" Much thanks to Dam and GrandSpleen.  It makes sense when you explain it that way."}]}
