I use this as an introductory quest for new players, even though it has stuff that aren't common (like bifurcated quests and two active quests as once) I never had a player that was confused. You can also play this as if it is a continuation of Passage Through Mirkwood, making the first game longer. \n\n \n\nMore information here [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1771-customscenario-a-moment-to-breath-v1/]!\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease, feedbacks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60222-customscenario-a-moment-to-breath-v1/?do=findComment&comment=592108","commentId":592108,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1328788033,"content":" I like it!  It looks like a pretty good introduction to the game.\n\nA small nit-pick, though: the word you want is \"breathe\", not \"breath\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60222-customscenario-a-moment-to-breath-v1/?do=findComment&comment=592130","commentId":592130,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1328790794,"content":"radiskull said:\n\n I like it!  It looks like a pretty good introduction to the game.\n\nA small nit-pick, though: the word you want is \"breathe\", not \"breath\".\n\n\n\n \n\nOh, thank you twice!\n\n \n\nAs soon as I get home, I'll change it in the quest cards and update it again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60222-customscenario-a-moment-to-breath-v1/?do=findComment&comment=592241","commentId":592241,"userName":"guest455987","timestamp":1328802010,"content":"Very interesting how the choice of which \"2\" quest card to go to depends on what transpires during the \"1\" quest.  One quick question for now...

(also, I say the same about the \"Hero's Ambush\" quest card partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif])\n(English is not my first language :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png])"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60222-customscenario-a-moment-to-breath-v1/?do=findComment&comment=592355","commentId":592355,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1328817426,"content":"Hey, updated the quest cards with correct wording.\nI cannot edit this topic's title, though.\n\n \n\nI also did a minor expansion on the explanation of how goes this quest with 4 players.\n\n \n\n \n\nTake a look people. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] "}]}
