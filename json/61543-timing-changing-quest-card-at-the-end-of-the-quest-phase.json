I resolve the staging step, tally up my willpower, and quest successfully. I then put progress tokens on the quest, sufficiently to complete this stage of the quest. In accordance with the rules, I immediately ignore the excess progress and resolve any effects on the new Quest card.\n\n \n\nHere's the question :\n\n \n\nIf the new quest card forces me to draw new encounter cards, are my characters still considered committed to the quest ? Or did they stop being comitted to the quest as soon as the progress tokens were placed during quest resolution ?\n\n \n\nFor example, if the new Quest card reveals Enemies from the Encounter deck, does Thalin's ability apply (1 dmg to enemies revealed from the encounter deck while he's committed to the quest) ? Would a Treachery card's effect affecting characters ''commited to the quest'' apply ?\n\n \n\nThanks in advance for the answer !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61543-timing-changing-quest-card-at-the-end-of-the-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=603265","commentId":603265,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1331135280,"content":" Your characters remain committed to the quest until the end of the Quest Phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61543-timing-changing-quest-card-at-the-end-of-the-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=603270","commentId":603270,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1331136139,"content":" I will take it as a yes, the effects would apply and they are still committed (unless I read you wrong).\n\n \n\nThanks Radiskull !\n\n \n\nP.S.

Me too, even though I know it's probably not true. I sure don't look like my avatar! \n\nAnyway, I agree that it's still part of the quest phase because there was no window of time in which the phase could have changed. Everything you described was in response to questing successfully, so until those responses are through, it seems you can't declare that the questing phase is over. Another interpretation is that the quest phase doesn't end until the travel phase begins, and since you haven't had an opportunity to travel in the time when cards are being revealed, it's still part of the quest phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61543-timing-changing-quest-card-at-the-end-of-the-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=603419","commentId":603419,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1331162591,"content":" Thanks to everyone.

(Core Set rules, p14)\n\nAlso, 'Quest Advancement', p22 : 'Players immediately advance to the next stage of a\nquest as soon as they place a number of progress tokens\nequal to or greater than the number of quest points\nthe current quest card has. (...)\nPlayers follow any instructions on the newly revealed\nquest card as it is revealed.'\n\nand '(...) the round\nsequence is not interrupted.'\n\nSo, if we follow the rules by the letter, I'll play like this :\n\n=> Quest Phase, beginning\n\n(...)\n\n=> Quest Phase, stage 3 (Resolution), beginning\n\n * Putting enough progress tokens\n * Game immediate standby caused by Quest Card advancement (we're still in the Resolution stage, Quest phase)\n * Revealing new ennemies and treachery as next Quest Card instructions (still in Resolution stage, Quest phase)\n * End of new Quest Card instructions, resuming play sequence\n\n=> Quest Phase, stage 3, end\n\n=> Quest phase, end\n\n \n\nNote that Thalin's effect states 'While Thalin is committed to a quest', and that during the Quest Card resolution, we're still in the quest phase. So the enemies revealed by the Quest Card instructions are dealt one damage token. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61543-timing-changing-quest-card-at-the-end-of-the-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=603518","commentId":603518,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1331182981,"content":"booored said:\n\n \n\nquesting and questing phase are different game states.... as soon as you place the token the quest is over.. Thalin only effects card revealed during questing, not at any other time.\n\n \n\n \n\nCare you find a rule quote for \"placing tokens ends quest\"?\n\nWhole point of Thalin is:\n\n\"While Thalin is committed to a quest...\"\n\nnot questing, but committed, which, once committed, he is until the end of the quest phase (unless removed from quest by card effect). He isn't committed to one stage of the quest card, if you complete say 1B and flip to 2B, he is still committed because we're still in the quest phase.\n\nNow, quickly going over the quest cards so far, I think HFG's 1B is the only one I could think of where it matters. Quest successfully and you trigger the Forced:\n\n\"Forced: After the players quest successfully, the first player looks at the top 3 cards of the encounter deck. Reveal and add 1 of those cards to the staging area, and discard the other 2 cards.\"\n\nSince HFG (IIRC) has Eastern Crows in the Encounter deck, Thalin could reveal and add them, then kill them right away. A really lucky draw would be to reveal a Clue, then reveal EC as guardian for it, zapping them with Thalin. Also last stage in Journey Down the Anduin the quest card reveals from the Encounter deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61543-timing-changing-quest-card-at-the-end-of-the-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=603623","commentId":603623,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1331204423,"content":"booored said:\n\n\n\n\nHis avatar is form Battlestar...\n\n \n\nRaidskull is this (well, I assumed it was)\n\nlayout_8410.jpg [http://joesparks.com/rddcomicbook/images/layout_8410.jpg]\n\n\n\n \n\nI'd kill for those comic books!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61543-timing-changing-quest-card-at-the-end-of-the-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=604242","commentId":604242,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1331365946,"content":"Rulewise booored might be wrong, but it bugs me that he (Thalin, not booored) s still committed to a quest when the quest he was committed to is already DUN.

Considering the fact that the encounter deck tends to be brutal, I would guess that the desingers intend for those treachery cards to still work. When I step back and consider how many times this situation might come up without Thalin present in a game, then I don't feel bad letting Thalin's ability work on cards revealed by the new quest card. Besides, as has been mentioned before, there are relatively few scenarios that reveal new cards when you advance to a new stage. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61543-timing-changing-quest-card-at-the-end-of-the-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=604407","commentId":604407,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1331425957,"content":" My conscience thanks you, good sir.
