Vote on whatever criteria you desire - this is very informal. Feel free to campaign for you hero, criticize the seeding, and give your vote rationale.

I do like Mirlonde, but Galadriel is a heavyweight.\n\nE: Pippin (Lo) v Dain Ironfoot - I would normally protest vote against Dain anyway, but Pippin is my most used hero and I would vote for him at #1.\n\nF: Glorfindel (S) v Théodred - I'm a little burned out on Glorfindel, but Theodred is outclassed by more recent leadership heroes.\n\nG: Sam Gamgee v Ori - Sam is such a beast.  3 willpower with built in readying and can become a wall on defense.\n\nH: Frodo Baggins v Beravor - I'm coming back around to Beravor a bit with the new Dunedain, but Frodo is such a nice safety blanket.\n\nI: Beorn v Nori - Honour Guard is breathing new life into Beorn.\n\nJ: Éomer v Glóin - I'm surprising myself with this pick.  Gloin jank is a lot of fun, and Eomer has a lot of competition with Legolas, Aragorn, Hama, and Beorn.\n\nK: Aragorn (Le) v Idraen - I'll take the free readying over the pay to ready.  Plus leadership Aragorn is probably the worst of the 3 versions.\n\nL: Aragorn (Lo) v Hirluin the Fair - Nobody likes Outlands.\n\nM: Prince Imrahil v Thalin - Thalin's ability just doesn't do enough against the newer quests.\n\nN: Legolas v Brand Son of Bain - Legolas wins in so many ways, including vastly better art\n\nO: Denethor v Gríma - Never really got into Grima or the doomed mechanic.  Denethor can be a great defender and his ability can change games.\n\nP: Beregond v Bombur - Although I do kind of like Bombur.\n\nQ: Merry (T) v Bard the Bowman - Bard really needs a new weapon attachment, otherwise he will always lose to Legolas or Haldir.\n\nR: Haldir of Lorien v Dúnhere - Dunhere decks can be really fun, but most of the time he's pretty useless.\n\nS: Mablung v Thorin Oakenshield - Mablung is becoming my most used tactics hero.  Versatile stats, good keywords, and amazing ability.\n\nT: Elrond v Glorfindel (Lo) - Kind of burned out on Vilya, but Elrond's other aspects are still amazing.\n\nU: Rossiel v Faramir (Lo) - Haven't actually used Rossiel yet, but I really want to try it.  Faramir will see even less play with his new Leadership version.\n\nV: Merry (S) v Bilbo Baggins - Merry hasn't impressed me as much as I thought he would, but Bilbo is still pretty weak.\n\nW: Bifur v Damrod - Bifur is a very good hero, but Damrod finally makes traps a thing.\n\nX: Gandalf v Caldara - Played Gandalf once, and never will again.  Meanwhile Caldara decks are really fun and get even better with Sword Thain.\n\nY: Gimli v Halbarad - Not a big fan of either, but Halbarad fits in better with my Hobbit decks.\n\nZ: Boromir (T) v Treebeard - I don't enjoy exploiting Boromir.  Treebeard hero can be a lot of fun with Elrond.\n\nAA: Erestor v Balin - Erestor finally made my Gondor leadership deck purr.\n\nAB: Éowyn v Dwalin - Yep\n\nAC: Eleanor v Erkenbrand - Shadow cancellation is so good.  Eleanor seems to always lead to worse cards.\n\nAD: Elrohir v Amarthiul - Looking forward to playing around with the Dunedain archtype.\n\nAE: Aragorn (T) v Théoden (T) - Such a beast.  Tactics Theoden is outclassed by his new incarnation.\n\nAF: Celeborn v Dori - 3 WP and the center of Silvan decks.\n\nAG: Arwen Undomiel v Háma - Seems too early to vote for Arwen.  Plus Hama is awesome, if nothing else just to recycle Foe Hammer instead of a feint/thicket lock.\n\nAH: Théoden (S) v Elladan - Takes Rohan to the next level\n\nAI: Boromir (Le) v Faramir (Le) - Faramir has potential, but I haven't played him yet.  Meanwhile I've been enjoying the Gondor deck lately.\n\nEdited December 2, 2015 by Teamjimby"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1916171","commentId":1916171,"userName":"koriakin97","timestamp":1449081436,"content":"D: Galadriel\n\nE: Pippin\n\nF: Glorfindel\n\nG: Sam\n\nH: Beravor\n\nI: Beorn\n\nJ: Eomer\n\nK: Idraen\n\nL: Aragorn\n\nM: Imrahil\n\nN: Legolas\n\nO: Denethor\n\nP: Beregond\n\nQ: Merry\n\nR: Dunhern\n\nS: Thorin\n\nT: Elrond\n\nU: Rossiel\n\nV: Merry\n\nW: Damrod\n\nX: Gandalf\n\nY: Gimli\n\nZ: Boromir\n\nAA: Erestor\n\nAB: Eowin\n\nAC: Erkenbrand\n\nAD: Elrohir\n\nAE: Aragorn\n\nAF: Celeborn\n\nAG: Arwen Undomiel\n\nAH: Theoden\n\nAI: Boromir"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1916187","commentId":1916187,"userName":"Stokesbook","timestamp":1449081885,"content":"D: Galadriel \n\n\nE: Pippin (Lo) \n\n\nF: Glorfindel (S) \n\n\nG: Sam Gamgee \n\n\nH: Frodo Baggins \n\n\nI: Beorn \n\n\nJ: Glóin\n\n\nK: Idraen\n\n\nL: Aragorn (Lo) \n\n\nM: Prince Imrahil \n\n\nN: Legolas \n\n\nO: Denethor \n\n\nP: Beregond \n\n\nQ: Merry (T) \n\n\nR: Haldir of Lorien \n\n\nS: Mablung \n\n\nT: Elrond \n\n\nU: Rossiel \n\n\nV: Merry (S) \n\n\nW: Damrod\n\n\nX: Gandalf \n\n\nY: Halbarad\n\n\nZ: Boromir (T) \n\n\nAA: Erestor \n\n\nAB: Éowyn \n\n\nAC: Eleanor \n\n\nAD: Elrohir \n\n\nAE: Aragorn (T) \n\n\nAF: Celeborn\n\n\nAG: Arwen Undomiel \n\n\nAH: Théoden (S) \n\n\nAI:  Faramir (Le)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1916190","commentId":1916190,"userName":"JTG81","timestamp":1449082061,"content":"D: Galadriel\n\nE: Dain Ironfoot\n\nF: Glorfindel (S)\n\nG: Sam Gamgee\n\nH: Frodo Baggins\n\nI: Nori\n\nJ: Éomer\n\nK: Aragorn (Le)\n\nL: Aragorn (Lo)\n\nM: Prince Imrahil\n\nN: Legolas\n\nO: Gríma\n\nP: Beregond\n\nQ: Merry (T)\n\nR: Haldir of Lorien\n\nS: Thorin Oakenshield\n\nT: Elrond\n\nU: Rossiel\n\nV: Bilbo Baggins\n\nW: Bifur\n\nX: Gandalf\n\nY: Halbarad\n\nZ: Boromir (T)\n\nAA: Erestor\n\nAB: Éowyn\n\nAC Erkenbrand\n\nAD: Amarthiul\n\nAE: Aragorn (T)\n\nAF: Celeborn\n\nAG: Arwen Undomiel\n\nAH: Théoden (S)\n\nAI: Faramir (Le)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1916225","commentId":1916225,"userName":"Greyhound78","timestamp":1449083474,"content":"D: Galadriel \n\n\nE:  Dain Ironfoot\n\n\nF: Glorfindel (S) \n\n\nG: Sam Gamgee \n\n\nH:  Beravor\n\n\nI: Nori\n\n\nJ: Éomer\n\n\nK: Aragorn (Le) \n\n\nL: Aragorn (Lo) \n\n\nM:  Thalin\n\n\nN: Legolas \n\n\nO:  Gríma\n\n\nP: Beregond \n\n\nQ: Merry (T) \n\n\nR:  Dúnhere\n\n\nS: Mablung \n\n\nT: Elrond \n\n\nU:  Faramir (Lo)\n\n\nV:  Bilbo Baggins\n\n\nW:  Damrod\n\n\nX: Gandalf \n\n\nY:  Halbarad\n\n\nZ: Boromir (T) \n\n\nAA: Erestor \n\n\nAB: Éowyn \n\n\nAC: Eleanor \n\n\nAD: Amarthiul\n\n\nAE: Aragorn (T) \n\n\nAF: Celeborn \n\n\nAG: Arwen Undomiel\n\n\nAH: Théoden (S) \n\n\nAI:  Faramir (Le)\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1916238","commentId":1916238,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1449083870,"content":"> I think in your template you provided there is an error in T.  It should list Elrond and Glorfindel (Lo) but it currently lists Spirit Glorfindel.\n\nFixed.

So excited to do this again. So let's start.\n\n \n\nD: Galadriel (Still one of the best heroes in this game. Still mad about her knocking out Legolas last year but clear winner against Mirlonde)\n\nE: Pippin (Lo) (Actually tough one but I like my new Ent-Deck with Pippin Merry and Mablung, so Dain, sorry but your out!)\n\nF: Théodred (I take every shot to eliminate Spirit Glorfindel from this competition :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )\n\nG: Sam Gamgee (Close again but I just see Sam as the better hero in this matchup)\n\nH: Beravor (Beravor got new life with the Dunedain power in the new cycle. Nice to see that she gets played more again!)\n\nI: Beorn (Big bad bear vs. dwarf... Hmm i think the bear will take that fight :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )\n\nJ: Éomer (I really hope Eomer takes it this year. Such a good hero and so much fun to play!)\n\nK: Aragorn (Le) (Since I am currently runnig a \"Three Hunters\" Deck for campaign mode, Aragorn is the clear winner in this matchup)\n\nL: Aragorn (Lo) (Don't like the Outland mechanic that much, so Aragorn again)\n\nM: Prince Imrahil (Imrahil has to be the winner here. Eomer and him is such a good combo when you have stuff leaving play!)\n\nN: Legolas (Thats a no brainer. Legolas is so much better. Will be interesting to see how far he gets this year)\n\nO: Denethor (Battle of the two anti-heroes here? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I don't play Grima ever so this one goes to Denethor)\n\nP: Beregond (It's so sad but I have to vote against the dwarf again in here. No one passes the wall named Beregond in combat :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )\n\nQ: Merry (T) (Tough one but since Merry made it into my Entdeck he edges out Bard in this matchup)\n\nR: Haldir of Lorien v Dúnhere (Haldir with Wingfoot is just so much more better then Dunhere at the moment so should be an easy win for him in this matchup)\n\nS: Mablung (Again Thorin is just overplayed for me and Mablung with the new Dunedain mechanic and with Ents he is just to good to pass on to someone else)\n\nT: Elrond (Clash of the high cost lore heroes clearly goes to Elrond. Glorfindels healing from the Coreset days is just too expensive)\n\nU: Rossiel (Rossiel is fresh and fun to play where instead Faramir in his lore version is just not that good tbh)\n\nV: Merry (S) (I'm not a huge fan f the spirit version from Merry but Bilbo is just not good for 9! starting thread)\n\nW: Damrod (Since I play a trapdeck as support to the new dunedain fighting deck, Damrod clearly wins this matchup)\n\nX: Gandalf (Caldara is so much better becazse..... Yeah ok Gandalf will stomp her in this fight :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )\n\nY: Gimli (Thats close again and since I ruled out every dwarf to this point and since still like to load up Gimli in my Three Hunters deck je takes this fight!)\n\nZ: Boromir (T) (Ouh let's see if Boromir manages to take this one. Tough first round opponent)\n\nAA: Erestor (Still not sure if I like him or not but he is just fresh and new. Balin has seen to much play for me in the past)\n\nAB: Éowyn (Come on Dwalin you know you can't win in thie matchup against the great lady of Rohan ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )\n\nAC: Erkenbrand (Interesting matchup here, both heroes have very usefull abilities but Erkenbrand has the better one!)\n\nAD: Amarthiul (I really like his ability to be dual sphere. That gives him (at least for me) the edge ofer Elrohir)\n\nAE: Aragorn (T) (We all know that Theoden (S) is so much more that kind of hero card everyone wished to have as Theoden. So get the tactic version out of here)\n\nAF: Celeborn (What did Dori again? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )\n\nAG: Arwen Undomiel (Is Arwen the \"dark horse\" in this years Championship race? I think she definetly has the potential to take a top spot in this tournament. With that kind of ally version there was great pressure on the hero card to be very good and I think FFG did really well here!)\n\nAH: Théoden (S) (Now thats what I wanted to see as Theoden! Rohan royals with Theoden (S), Eowyn and Eomer is a really good deck)\n\nAI: Faramir (Le) (The sons of Gondor in a first round clash! Nice! But Faramir wins this one because his ability is just better! Can't wait for the new Saga Expansion)\n\n \n\nReally great to see this format come back this year again. Nice matchups in the first round some seem very onesided but let's see how this one turns out. Who do you think can make a suprise here? Without looking at the other posts until now I think Treebeard has the potential to upset Boromir in round 1 but we have to see.\n\nShout out to Thanatopsis for hosting this years event, really appriciate that!\n\nEdited December 3, 2015 by Crabble"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1916806","commentId":1916806,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1449107572,"content":"D: Galadriel\n\nE: Dain\n\nF: Glorfindel\n\nG: Sam\n\nH: Frodo\n\nI: Beorn\n\nJ: Eomer.

She didn't deserve the win last year in my opinion but is far better than Mirlonde who I did not even vote for to make the brackets. \n\nE: Pippin (Lo). This is a hard one... Lore Pippin is neat and far better than his useless spirit iteration but I much prefer dwarves to hobbits.... Dain is overpowered is a silly way though making dwarves far stronger than they should be as a faction so going to go with Pippin ultimately. \n\nF: Glorfindel (S). Glorfindel all the way! Whether he is a crutch or no I still enjoy using him and Asfaloth saves the day very often.\n\nG: Sam Gamgee. Sam is a great hero, especially for his low threat cost and high willpower. \n\nH: Frodo Baggins. This one is also hard, don't use either of these heroes at all. Frodo has a great ability many are able to deck build around which is cool and he can be a great quasi defender (take threat instead of damage) whereas as powerful as Beravor is at the end of the day its just card draw which to me is sort of boring. Also I don't particularly like some of the FFG created characters.... namely the ones without a backstory and that were already used in a different game.... (yes im talking about Thalin, Caldara and Beravor). Others they have created since these three have been fantastic though.\n\nI: Beorn. Nice and unique, nothing else need be said!\n\nJ: Éomer. Badass art and badass offensive hero.\n\nK: Aragorn (Le). Not a big fan of Idraen.\n\nL: Aragorn (Lo). Hirluin and outlands in general can get lost. Friends don't let friends play outlands. \n\nM: Prince Imrahil. More amazing art and a great hero. \n\nN: Legolas. Hahahaha brand is screwed in this matchup, this is the OG hero champion and for good reason. Great attacker with ranged from the get go and a progress maker with his ability. Pseudo quester and attacker, best of both worlds!\n\nO: Denethor. Hate both these characters and don't really like either hero either. Many people love Grima and I understand how useful and powerful he can be but I never got into the doomed player cards and the tolkien nerd in me would hate playing with him as one of my heroes just knowing that in reality he ends up being a villain, one that is even given chances to redeem himself but refuses. Denethor is a decent defender and in lore and at least if someone really wants they could run Denethor, Faramir, Boromir which is pretty cool. Who are you going to run Grima with thematically? The Saruman hero we don't have yet and will potentially (and hopefully for me) never get? I guess you could run him with Rohan heroes.... but eh.... \n\nP: Beregond. The first hero I used that is completely dedicated to defending. Elrohir took his place a long time ago but I won't forget the fun I had with Beregond!\n\nQ: Merry (T). Not a big fan of the hobbits but even less of a fan of Bard and Brand. Also tactics merry allows some pretty bonkers combos in multiplayer allowing for some pretty serious slaying of enemies. \n\nR: Haldir of Lorien. This match up is pretty funny, Dunhere is a poor mans Haldir. Haldir overtook Legolas as my favorite offensive hero when he came out. He can provide several free \"feints\" over the course of a game if your deck/s are built around getting the most out of his ability. Stopping several enemy attacks can be insanely beneficial and can keep your heroes and deck alive and still running! You can also more safety commit extra characters to questing or attacking (as opposed to defense) thanks to his ability. \n\nS: Mablung. Mablung seems to be a pretty pivotal hero for many decks these days thanks to his resource acceleration. Many have paired him with the new Dunedain heroes and strategies which works rather well. \n\nT: Elrond. Another harsh matchup, my boy Elrond got this one easy, I still think he should have won last year. Great stats, great abilities, can actually quest WITHOUT his ring  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] and can attack or defend like a normal useful regular hero. He was cheated I tell you!\n\nU: Rossiel. Another great hero that is very unique. The whole victory display mechanic is really clever and seems like it would be fairly fun to play. I don't think she'll make it that far because the whole victory display deck is fairly niche. \n\nV: Merry (S). Haha gross, hobbit v hobbit. Definitely Merry all the way though, his spirit version is fantastic and is a good replacement for Glorfindel in many decks. Fantastic repeatable threat reduction, possibly the best we have so far. \n\nW: Damrod. An easy one, the fantastic new hero breathing new life into trap decks wins it hands down. \n\nX: Gandalf. Eugh this match up is just awful for me...... I hate the Gandalf hero and am a part of the small group that wishes he was never made but think Caldara is pretty **** useless. I get that in a deck built specifically around her ability she can be pretty **** good but you should not have to build an entire deck around one heroes ability, you do start off with 3 of them after all!!! Caldara is way too niche and not in a good way like Rossiel. Gandalf however is mega mega OP and trivialises most quests (especially when paired with other powerful heroes) and has too many attachments that only work for him that are all pretty much slightly OP on their own as well.... so ultimately as much as it pains me to do so I vote for Gandalf as it is better that a hero is OP than a coaster/almost a coaster because at least if they are overpowered they will see a fair bit of play, crappy heroes just sit in binders or boxes and never get taken out. \n\nY: Halbarad. More heroes that don't exhaust to quest given certain circumstances is something I'd like to see more of for sure. \n\nAlso being able to optionally engage a second enemy can be huge and pure combat decks can use this hero to great effect to keep the questing/support players pretty **** safe. Sam and Halbarad are great together as well as you can optionally engage two enemies with engagement high than your threat and double boost Sam this way.\n\nZ: Boromir (T). Boromir is an absolute machine and an awesome hero, he can break the game with Blood/Fire decks however which to me is a little lame. Treebeard however does not match up to his ally version in my eyes however so going with Boromir with this one. \n\nAA: Erestor. Just a crazy hero with a crazy ability. Turns deck building completely on its head. Want a deck that uses up to 100 cards instead of 50 but is still viable? Bam, use Erestor and this is a thing. \n\nAB: Dwalin. No way Eowyn will lose this so may as well vote for lolz. Never liked Eowyn. The character herself, the art on this card, the ability. Some of the new Noldor discard mechanics and cards are really clever and well designed and also feature card recursion, drawing cards at times (rather than discarding) like Lindir for example and other cool abilities (playing from your graveyard, Erestors wacky ability etc) whereas Eowyn is just \"discard a card to give +1 willpower\". Boring and a waste of valuable player cards. I get that you can pump her hard and with any player and can power quest through by doing so but there are other ways to do this and she always just seemed so basic, boring and meh to me. Only one player can pump it but for 1 resource Protector of Lorien does more or less the same thing but can do so for willpower OR defense. Have never used her and probably never will. I hate discarding cards as you can probably tell...... \n\nAC: Erkenbrand. He is an awesome defender with a great ability. Eleanor is just a horrible design. Test of will is one of the strongest player cards in the game and its ability to cancel the when revealed effects of a card can be an absolute lifesaver or completely invaluable. Eleanor can do this every single turn... sure you have to exhaust her and sure you have to then reveal another encounter card but many quests that feature quite a few treacheries and rely on treacheries to do most of the damage to the player can just be shut down using Eleanor. Does she do anything else you ask? No her stats are all sucky even her 2 defense because she only has 3 hitpoints and is as fragile as a hobbit...  so she is both crazy good and really bad at the same time....  She is just test of will (except that you replace the card so not as good) on a hero that is repeatable every turn....  why not just create another cool card that does what test of will does but has stricter requirements or costs more to play or has an alternative cost (discard an ally, discard a card from your hand, deal 1 damage to a hero etc etc) and is in a different sphere. We literally have not seen anything else that can cancel when revealed effects all the way from the core set until recently when we got the door is closed. I think eventually we will see a third event or perhaps even an attachment or ally that can cancel when revealed effects through some other method. I think that this card should have been created shortly after the core set especially considering how nasty treacheries can be and how quite a few if not most cannot really be avoided or negated in any other way and Eleanor should have just not been created. I really don't like the three characters FFG created and simply ported from another LOTR themed game do I?  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nAD: Elrohir. I have a feeling Amarthiul will win this because he is new and shiny.... even though in reality he is pretty sucky and has possibly the worst art for any hero. I swear that art is a woman and was originally made for a female character. I reckon there was some sort of mix up and the artist didn't realise the character was meant to be male or that art was meant for another character originally, it just does not make sense. I have showed the card to my girlfriend a few times now (who does not play the game) and she agrees the card depicts a woman. thighs, waist, what look like breasts, even the face are all extremely feminine. \n\nI know it is a very mean thing to say but honestly if there was no mix up and that is what the artist gave FFG for Amarthiul's character I really hope FFG do not use that artist again for this game. \n\nElrohir is my favorite defender by far and I think the better of the two brothers and severely underrated. Many many times I have blocked several especially nasty attacks in one turn and come out completely unscathed thanks to Elrohir. In fact he does it in most games if you use him right. So few people seem to use the brothers which is such a shame to me. I hope the new Arwen hero prompts more people to use them even if I don't think she goes as well as she could with them. \n\nAE: Aragorn (T). The art for Theoden is EPIC but he isn't for me and I prefer Aragorn's \"scorpigorn\" ability. \n\nAF: Celeborn. Dori's ability is as bad as Amarthiul's art. Enough said.\n\nAG: Arwen Undomiel. The Hama - Lock is a pretty sweet combo but the new Arwen hero has a fantastic (albeit simple) ability and great art. Another 3 willpower hero with a relatively low threat cost is pretty nice as well I must admit. \n\nAH: Elladan. Go Twins! (or really just go Elrohir because secretly I wish I could replace Elladan but keep Elrohir's 3 defense... where are the new versions of both of them already?!)\n\nAI:Faramir (Le). Move aside Treebeard, make way for the KING OF THE ENTS!\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1916990","commentId":1916990,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1449127338,"content":"D: Galadriel.

Sad to see the 'nameless she-elf' go though.\n\nE: Pippin (Lo) - Weren't it for Pippin, 50% of the decks I make wouldn't be possible, and I can't play with Dain anyway in MP 'cause he's too good so he makes things boring.\n\nF: Glorfindel (S) - Oh, uhm. Theodred is one of my favorite Leadership heroes, especially for 2-player games. Glorfindel is Glorfindel. Uhm. I guess I still can't bear myself to vote against one of the mighty of the Firstborn. At least not twice.\n\nG: Sam Gamgee - Bye Ori, no regrets.\n\nH: Beravor - I love Beravor, probably because I'm a draw-junkie.\n\nI: Beorn - Roar! I love the character, and he's a very good hero too, especially when the setup puts a lot of pressure on the players. A shame Shadows have gotten so bad lately..\n\nJ: Éomer - I've never been a fan of Gloin, while I really enjoyed Eomer when I started playing.\n\nK: Idraen - Aragorn (Le) is good, but I'd rather have the Lore version. Idraen makes an appearence in almost all of my multi-tasking Spirit - Lore decks, she's especially good combined with Glorfindel and Asfaloth.\n\nL: Aragorn (Lo) - So good. Not a fan of Outlands either, I don't think they really are that good. One can abuse Loragorn, but there are also plenty of decks one can build using his strengths while not having the feeling you're exploiting the game, you just need to stay away from Doomed cards.\n\nM: Thalin - He enables an archetype, and a very fun one.\n\nN: Legolas - :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. Am I supposed to justify this?\n\nO: Gríma - He is awesome. He is so good in Solo decks! I really can't see how one could put him on par with Denethor.\n\nP: Beregond - I do not love him, but Bombur is even more boring.\n\nQ: Bard the Bowman - I don't really like 3 ATK hobbit nonsense, not to mention the absurd combos Merry (T) can be part of.\n\nR: Haldir of Lorien - My favorite hero. Amazing art, amazing ability. Love the character too.\n\nS: Mablung - I like his ability.\n\nT: Elrond - If Vilya were a bit more consistent I would like him better, but his healing ability alone is worth it in big MP games, or with Treebeard.\n\nU: Rossiel - Not too stoked by her, but I like Faramir even less.\n\nV: Merry (S) - He's a beast. He makes Secrecy decks so much better, almost enabling the archetype all on his own.\n\nW: Bifur - This is so difficult! I like both. I'm going with Bifur because he fits in a much wider range of decks.\n\nX: Gandalf - Istari. He is in one of the decks I'm going to use after everything else has failed. Or when I just want to make the ecnounter deck look miserable. Middle Earth's saviour. Play him. Play him! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nY: Gimli - Gimli can be a lot of fun. I hope new cards will make me love Halbarad more though.\n\nZ: Treebeard - Super tough matchup. I like both characters. I Love both heroes. Treebeard gets the vote because Boromir always feels like abusing the game to me, but it was hard.\n\nAA: Erestor - More interesting.\n\nAB: Éowyn - She's 4 WP. Boring, but so **** effective. Dwaling is usable only in a handful fo quests.\n\nAC: Erkenbrand - One of the best heroes in the game for me, and by far the best defender.\n\nAD: Amarthiul - Let's give him a chance.. Hmm..\n\nAE: Aragorn (T) - He's bonkers. I'm not much into Rohan, and find Theodred to be a waste - he's got so much stuff he can use but he still feels too weak for me.\n\nAF: Celeborn - Had to Google 'Dori Hero' 'cause I've already forgotten he exists. 'nuff said.\n\nAG: Arwen Undomiel - She looks awesome. AWESOME. I've never been a big fan of Hama either - if you take a look, under the voice 'good Tactics heroes' you can clearly read 'abuse game mechanics' as the definition. I don't like it. Well, to each his own.\n\nAH: Theoden - I don't like Theoden's spirit version either but Elladan always struck me as uninteresting and the worse of the Twins. Things will change with Arwen and the new attachments, but I'm not really sure it will be enough for him to become interesting.\n\nAI: Faramir (Le) - Faramir (Le) is much more interesting to play with."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1921000","commentId":1921000,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1449384162,"content":"D: Galadriel\n\n\nE: Pippin (Lo)\n\n\nF: Glorfindel (S)\n\n\nG: Sam Gamgee\n\n\nH: Frodo Baggins\n\n\nI: Beorn\n\n\nJ: Éomer\n\n\nK: Idraen\n\n\nL: Aragorn (Lo)\n\n\nM: Prince Imrahil\n\n\nN: Legolas\n\n\nO: Gríma\n\n\nP: Beregond\n\n\nQ: Merry (T)\n\n\nR: Haldir of Lorien\n\n\nS: Mablung\n\n\nT: Elrond\n\n\nU: Rossiel\n\n\nV: Merry (S)\n\n\nW: Damrod\n\n\nX: Caldara\n\n\nY: Gimli\n\n\nZ: Boromir (T)\n\n\nAA: Erestor\n\n\nAB: Éowyn\n\n\nAC: Eleanor\n\n\nAD: Amarthiul\n\n\nAE: Aragorn (T)\n\n\nAF: Celeborn\n\n\nAG: Arwen Undomiel\n\n\nAH: Théoden (S)\n\n\nAI: Faramir (Le)\n\n\n \n\n\nThanks for the copy paste option, so much easier!! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1921039","commentId":1921039,"userName":"scwont","timestamp":1449390713,"content":"D: Galadriel\n\nE: Pippin (Lo)\n\nF: Glorfindel (S)\n\nG: Sam Gamgee\n\nH: Beravor\n\nI: Beorn\n\nJ: Éomer\n\nK: Idraen\n\nL: Aragorn (Lo)\n\nM: Prince Imrahil\n\nN: Legolas\n\nO: Gríma\n\nP: Beregond\n\nQ: Merry (T)\n\nR: Haldir of Lorien\n\nS: Thorin Oakenshield\n\nT: Elrond)\n\nU: Rossiel\n\nV: Merry (S)\n\nW: Damrod\n\nX: Gandalf\n\nY: Halbarad\n\nZ: Treebeard\n\nAA: Erestor\n\nAB: Éowyn\n\nAC: Erkenbrand\n\nAD: Amarthiul\n\nAE: Aragorn (T)\n\nAF: Celeborn\n\nAG: Háma\n\nAH: Théoden (S)\n\nAI: Faramir (Le)\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1921198","commentId":1921198,"userName":"RebelX","timestamp":1449408420,"content":"D             Galadriel\n\nE             Dain\n\nF             Glorfindel\n\nG            Sam\n\nH             Frodo\n\nI              Beorn\n\nJ              Eomer\n\nK             Aragorn\n\nL              Aragorn\n\nM           Imrahil\n\nN            Legolas\n\nO            Grima\n\nP             Beregond\n\nQ            Merry\n\nR             Haldir\n\nS             Thorin\n\nT             Elrond\n\nU            Rossiel\n\nV             Merry\n\nW           Bifur\n\nX             Gandalf\n\nY             Gimli\n\nZ             Boromir\n\nAA          Erestor\n\nAB          Eowyn\n\nAC          Erkenbrand\n\nAD          Elrohir\n\nAE          Aragorn\n\nAF          Celeborn\n\nAG         Hama\n\nAH          Theoden\n\nAI           Boromir"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1922055","commentId":1922055,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1449459917,"content":"D.  Galadriel\n\nE.  Dain Ironfoot\n\nF.  Glorfindel (Spirit)\n\nG.  Sam Gamgee\n\nH.  Beravor\n\nI.   Nori\n\nJ.  Eomer\n\nK.  Aragorn (Leadership)\n\nL.  Hirluin the Fair\n\nM.  Imrahil\n\nN.  Legolas\n\nO.  Denethor\n\nP.  Beregond\n\nQ.  Bard the Bowman\n\nR.  Haldir of Lorien\n\nS.  Thorin Oakenshield\n\nT.  Elrond\n\nU.  Rossiel\n\nV.  Merry (Spirit)\n\nW.  Damrod\n\nX.  Gandalf\n\nY.  Gimli\n\nZ.  Treebeard\n\nAA.  Erestor\n\nAB.  Eowyn\n\nAC.  Elanor\n\nAD.  Amarthiul\n\nAE.  Aragorn (Tactics)\n\nAF.  Celeborn\n\nAG.  Arwen Undomiel\n\nAH.  Theoden (Spirit)\n\nAI.  Faramir (Leadership)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1922956","commentId":1922956,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1449511750,"content":"--- Round 2 CLOSED ---\n\n \n\nRound 2 voting is officially closed\n\n \n\nThe 32 heroes moving on to Round 3 are:\n\nGaladriel\nPippin (Lo)\nGlorfindel (S)\nSam Gamgee\nFrodo Baggins\nBeorn\nÉomer\nAragorn (Le)\nAragorn (Lo)\nPrince Imrahil\nLegolas\nGríma\nBeregond\nMerry (T)\nHaldir of Lorien\nMablung\nElrond\nRossiel\nMerry (S)\nDamrod\nGandalf\nGimli\nBoromir (T)\nErestor\nÉowyn\nErkenbrand\nAragorn (T)\nAmarthiul\nCeleborn\nArwen Undomiel\nThéoden (S)\nFaramir (Le)\n\n \n\nAll three Aragorn heroes are moving on\nOnly one dwarf hero, Gimli, made it out of this round.\n\n \n\nThere were several cases where higher seeded trounced their competition (Galadriel, Éowyn, and Beregond each only had two votes against them).

Galadriel: Honestly really don't like either of these heroes, but Pippin has no business taking out Dain!\nAK: Glorfindel (S): Never been fond of Sam.\nAL: Frodo Baggins: I quite like Frodo and his ability.\nAM: Éomer: I like Eomer more right now simply because I am really interested in making a Rohan deck with him in it.  Leadership Aragorn is still really strong, though.\nAN: Aragorn (Lo): Lore Aragorn is so great, allowing for some very fun high threat or doomed-based decks.\nAO: Gríma: I think this is a really tough choice.  Legolas provides much needed location management in a sphere that otherwise lacks it.  Grima also loses out on usefulness as you add more and more players, but in the end Grima's ability is a lot more fun to me and Legolas has been around for quite a while.\nAP: Beregond: Beregond wins this one for me easily.  Whenever I use hobbits they just die to things that deal direct damage [the obvious exception being Frodo, of course!]\nAQ: Mablung: I quite like Haldir's ability, but I have had a much easier time building successful decks with Mablung.  His ability can generate 2-3 resources per turn easily in some scenarios.\nAR: Elrond: Elrond is just a powerhouse having 3 insanely useful abilities (Vilya being one)\nAS: Damrod: I like Damrod's ability a lot, even though I think Merry might be more useful.  But Merry is a non-Frodo hobbit, so meh, he will probably just die.\nAT: Gimli: I don't really like either of my choices here.  Gandalf totally ruins Sneak Attack Gandalf combo and despite being strong, I think is best suited for solo play.  Gimli has been quite useful during my progression through the game, but unfortunately other decks that fill similar roles just outclass any Gimli deck I've made.\nAU: Boromir (T): Just plain strong.\nAV: Éowyn: My appreciation for willpower manipulation during questing cannot be overstated.\nAW: Amarthiul: While I don't have much experience with Amarthiul, the ability is just so strong.\nAX: Arwen Undomiel: Haven't really gotten on the Silvan train and Arwen just looks so good to me.\nAY: Théoden (S):  I really like both of these, but I am looking forward to making a Rohan deck soon. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1923025","commentId":1923025,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1449513758,"content":"AJ:

Aragorn (Le) - Almost no reason to use Leadership Aragorn anymore.\nAN: Aragorn (Lo) v Prince Imrahil - Tough call, but I'll go with Imrahil's readying.  Not a big fan of exploiting threat and doomed with Aragorn.\nAO: Legolas v Gríma - Legolas is still arguably the best attacker in the game.\nAP: Beregond v Merry (T) - Tactics Merry is pretty much just there to break the game.  Meanwhile Beregond is tied with Erkenbrand for the best defender in the game.\nAQ: Haldir of Lorien v Mablung - Mablung makes tactics so splashable and he combos with so many heroes.  Haldir is also great, but haven't used him much lately.\nAR: Elrond v Rossiel - Pretty sure Elrond will crush this one, but I'll give a support vote to the victory display mechanic.\nAS: Merry (S) v Damrod - Merry is my 4th favorite Hobbit while Damrod single-handedly makes traps a thing.\nAT: Gandalf v Gimli - Protest vote against Gandalf\nAU: Boromir (T) v Erestor - I'm really enjoying Erestor.  There are so many deck possibilities with him.\nAV: Éowyn v Erkenbrand - Eowyn is still the best questing hero in the game, but I do love shadow cancellation.\nAW: Amarthiul v Aragorn (T) - Such a wrecking ball.\nAX: Celeborn v Arwen Undomiel - Still think it's a bit early for Arwen.  Celeborn makes Silvan a thing.\nAY: Théoden (S) v Faramir (Le) - Faramir might be good, but haven't tried him yet.  Meanwhile Theoden is one of my most played heroes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1923040","commentId":1923040,"userName":"Jekzer","timestamp":1449514170,"content":"AJ:

Mablung just enables so many power plays just by being there.\nAR: Elrond - I love the idea of Rossiel and the victory display stuff, but I've yet to build a deck with her that I'm totally happy with, whereas Elrond features in multiple decks that I'm very happy with.\nAS: Merry (S) - Haven't built a Damrod/Trap deck yet, whereas Merry's ridiculously good threat reduction enables my Dunhere deck, as well as being a big help to a bunch of others.\nAT: Gandalf - Gimli was a beast back in Core Set days, but as fun as it is to pump him up, it's not as impressive as a Gandalf deck.\nAU: Erestor - Both have the potential for some pretty insane power, but I find Erestor the more interesting of the two.\nAV: Erkenbrand - Eowyn is still so ubiquitous, one can get bored of her, whereas Erkenbrand is incredibly useful but sometimes overlooked.\nAW: Amarthiul - After the initial lustre wore off, I haven't found myself that enthused about Tactagorn to be honest, and he doesn't fit so well into the general Dunedain playstyle, whereas I think Amarthiul is going to be amazing in that context.\nAX: Arwen Undomiel - Silvans are great, but again I go for versatility, plus Arwen is shiny and new and exciting.\nAY: Faramir (Le) - Have yet to build a really good Rohan deck with Theoden, whereas Faramir as previously noted enables crazy shenanigans with Ents.

Pure spite vote because Galadriel should not have won against Elrond last year.\nAK: Sam Gamgee. Oooft this one is hard!!!! Both are three willpower low threat cost, action advantage heroes. Glorfindel is better at lower threat with better stats and access to Asfaloth (light is like his versions of Sam's ability) so in my opinion he is strictly better. He is however a complete crutch because of Asfaloth and how stupidly incomparable any other location focused player card is to Asfaloth. I truly hope one day we get Asfaloth mark 2 that has nothing to do with Glorfindel and so for this reason I vote for Sam\nAL: Beorn. Never used or felt the need to use Frodo's ability. Why not just use a proper defender?\nAM: Éomer. Dope art and an awesome offensive character.\nAN: Aragorn (Lo). Used to rely heavily upon his threat reduction. Great hero and is a key part of making a deck with higher starting threat or using doomed player cards etc He will also be pretty great for the valour keyword allowing you to get off all your valour triggers then reset back to a lower threat.\nAO: Legolas. Another joke match up. Original hero championship champion vs traitor who raises everyones threat.\nAP: Beregond. Going to go with Beregond, guy is an absolute wall.\nAQ: Haldir of Lorien. One of my favorite heroes and my favorite offensive hero\nAR: Elrond. Elrond deserves another shot at the title... robbed I tell you!\nAS: Merry (S). New spirit merry is great and as fantastic as Damrod is traps are still not viable in power decks or \"rule them all\" style decks as there are just too many quests that have all attachment immune enemies or only a boss that is player/attachment immune.\nAT: Gimli. Not a fan of Gimli but Gandalf should never have been made and is on a different level power wise to all other heroes which is stupid. No one hero should be that good or have that many attachments all to themself (and we haven't even gotten Narya yet.....)\nAU: Boromir (T). Look don't get me wrong Erestor is awesome and I love how much he opens up the deck building in this game but at the same time he is definitely not for me... Boromir on the other hand served me well for quite a long time when I first got him. He can be the centerpiece of a deck and just be amazing. He can unfortunately be abused very easily which to me is his biggest downside....\nAs impressive as it is to see people like Seastan make decks that break the game to me this is always somewhat upsetting. To me personally it makes the game a little less fantastic and that little bit more dodgy and not playtested or designed well enough every time a new one of these decks emerges.\nBoromir is usually in most of these decks.... he personally is not to blame though! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\nAV: Erkenbrand. Love defensive heroes and have never liked Eowyn. Go Erkenbrand and his extremely unique shadow cancellation!\nAW: Aragorn (T). Oh.... so won't need to vote against Amarthiul long after all..... theres no way hes going to beat Aragorn (T)..... right?\nAX: Arwen Undomiel. I am warming up to this hero more every day and I think I have discovered a pretty nifty strategy/way to play her that might be extremely powerful and fun!\nAY: Faramir (Le). Break the Dam!

I do like lore pippin, but Galadriel is an amazing hero.\nAK: Sam Gamgee - 3 willpower for 8 threat makes Sam splashable in almost any deck (especially as a leadership hero). You don't even need his awesome abillity.\nAL: Frodo Baggins - Frodo is still an amazing defender, especially with newer ways to keep threat down.\nAM: Éomer - I like other iterations of Aragorn better, and Eomer is just fun to play.\nAN: Prince Imrahil - Difficult decision, but there are now many cards that work with things leaving play (ie. eagles, rohan, silvan)\nAO: Legolas - Doomed seems purely useful for solo play. Never been a fan.\nAP: Merry (T) - Beregond is great, but merry is extremely splashable. He is also very fun in a hobbit deck.\nAQ: Mablung - Mablung has something nearly unique in tactics: resource generation. Excellent as the sole tactics hero in a multi-sphere deck.\nAR: Rossiel - I do love Elrond, but Rossiel is just fun and potentially even more powerful under the right circumstances.\nAS: Merry (S) - Amazing abillity that enables a lot of other strategies - really the first time I feel maintaining secrecy for an entire game has been viable.\nAT: Gimli - I still feel that having a Gandalf hero is kind of... wrong. Plus I am a huge fan of both Gandalf allies. Also, I like the risk/reward style that Gimli and Gloin employ.\nAU: Boromir (T) - Extremely powerful hero given the right tools, also quite fun to play. I don't have Erestor yet, though he looks to be fun as well.\nAV: Éowyn - There are other/better ways of defending, and Erkenbrand screams for solely a lore pairing.\nAW: Aragorn (T) - Very fun to use, possible the best iteration of Aragorn.\nAX: Arwen Undomiel - Resource acceleration in spirit?

Not only gameplay-wise: her art is amazing ( I do not like Magali's style a lot, but for me Galadriel had been her masterpiece until we got Arwen). She's a noldor, a much more fascinating character compared to a hobbit. Finally, Galadriel makes mono spirt decks much more fun to play, so here we go.\nAK: Glorfindel (S) v Sam Gamgee - As far as power level is concerned there no doubts, even considering Sam is an exceptionally strong hero. Flavor-wise, Glorfindel is one of my favorite characters. Finally, I love how is card is so thematic in its mechanics: he has the ability to conceal himself from Sauron's gaze, but if he chooses to take an active role in the exploring and adventuring he will inexorably draw the attention of the enemy; just awesome.\nAL: Frodo Baggins v Beorn - I like Beorn a lot, both as a character and as a hero. In fact, I was very tempted to vote him instead. However, I cannot help but think he almost never makes into my decks, while Frodo does and granted me some awesome moments -'Oh no, Hummerhorns engage this round! We're gonna lose a Hero! -Engages Hummerhorns, raises threat while mimicking Frodo wearing the Ring to avoid the giant buzzing wasps; follows a collective sigh of relief. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\nAM: Éomer v Aragorn (Le) - I let my sentimentalism take over on this one, and I'll go with the nostalgia of my first games, playing with Eomer the Voice of Isengard quests. He's an interesting hero too.\nAN: Aragorn (Lo) v Prince Imrahil - I've never liked Imrahil too much. Loragorn is amazing.\nAO: Legolas v Gríma - Controversial I know. Legolas is awesome. If I were to vote considering the flavor it would be th Son of Thranduil victorious without breaking a sweat. However, gameplay-wise my preference goes to Grima Sweettongue. First, Grima appeals to the solo player in me: he's one of the cases of a card designed to work better in solitaire than in multiplayer, while still being viable in multiplayer - if your friends aren't too particular about their threat level of course :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Furthermore, Legolas tends to dominate the deckbuilding of every deck he's in: 3x HutB, 3x Bows,3x Blades, 3x Foe-Hammer etc. While effective, it is also boring after a while. Grima however enable a host of crazy decks to function and is very very powerful: he's by no means inferior to Legolas power-wise.\nAP: Beregond v Merry (T). As I've already stated (see previous round of voting) I don't like how easily Merry can be abused and I don't like the notion of a Hobbit attacking better than, say, Halbarad.\n\nAQ: Haldir of Lorien v Mablung. See previous round, I love Haldir and he's very strong too. It's a pity, because I also like Mablung and play him quite often.\nAR: Elrond v Rossiel. Not a fan of Rossiel: flavor-wise, her reference to elf-magic is great, but her personal story is lame. Elrond is great, I only wish Vilya was less of a cheeky play, but it's still fun to use.\nAS: Merry (S) v Damrod. I love this side of Merry, the judicious one. The hero is also very very powerful. It's a pity he is matched against his best fellow (I have very good deck that runs both). I rate Damrod lower because, albeit good, he is forced into a limited archetype, whereas Merry is much more flexible.\nAT: Gandalf v Gimli. Gandalf is Gandalf.\nAU: Boromir (T) v Erestor. Despite being prone to abuse, I still like Boromir a lot. He's also one of my favorite characters in the book.\nAV: Éowyn v Erkenbrand. Gone are the days in which Eowyn was the only access to high starting WP, even if she still is one of the best options. However she is also tremendously dull. Erkenbrand on the other side is the best defender we currently have, and a great character as well. And the art on him is sooooo much better than that on Eo.\nAW: Amarthiul v Aragorn (T). Time will tell, but to beat his chieftain Amarthiul will have to prove his mettle more than once.\nAX: Celeborn v Arwen Undomiel. Celeborn, the fashion-victim elf (sorry Magali, couldn't resist making the joke) is good, and silvans are one of my favorite traits too (and nostalgia, again). However he fits only in that kind of deck, whereas Arwen has an amazing artwork (congrats Magali, a huge improvement!) and his amazingly good. Perhaps too good. Who knows? Anyway, she got me so excited thinking about how many new decks could be built with her.. One of my new favorite heroes, for sure.\nAY: Théoden (S) v Faramir (Le). I don't like Theoden (and Rohan decks in general) very much, while it looks liek Faramir could be an interesting choice for solo play - I admittedly need to test him a bit more, but he's intriguing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1928379","commentId":1928379,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1449777136,"content":"AJ: Pippin (Lo)\n\nAK: Sam Gamgee\nAL: Frodo Baggins\nAM: Aragorn (Le)\nAN: Aragorn (Lo)\nAO: Legolas\nAP: Beregond\nAQ: Mablung\nAR: Elrond\nAS: Damrod\nAT: Gandalf\nAU: Boromir (T)\nAV: Erkenbrand\nAW: Aragorn (T)\nAX: Arwen Undomiel\nAY: Théoden (S)\n\n \n\n \n\nI don't have much to say this time because most of the matchups involve at least one hero I haven't used or haven't used much.

Great low threat cost leadership hero with great willpower and inbuilt readying. Plus Galadriel won last year against Elrond so she got to go!\n\nBA: Éomer. Frodo beat Beorn?? Boo! Eomer has amazing art and is a fantastic attacker. Not a fan of Frodo, I like to defend with epic defenders not with my threat!\n\nBB: Legolas. Yes he has won this all before but with good reason. Also I think the whole desperate alliance + aragorn conbo to reset everyone s/multiple players threat is lame.\n\nBC: Haldir all the way. I actually prefer him to Legolas and Legolas is epic. Legolas won this whole thing because he is such a fantastic attacker and his great ability. Haldir also has ranged, a 9 threat cost and like Legolas sort of providing an effect similar to asfaloth or other location control, Haldir can provides a feint type effect killing enemies before they can even attack multiple times in a game if he is used right.\n\nGiven all this I think he actually deserves a shot at the title. Can't believe he almost lost to Mablung, thank goodness for whoever broke that tie!!!\n\nBD: Elrond. No brainer, Elrond should have beaten Galadriel last year and I'd love for him to also make it to the final.\n\nBE: Boromir (T). Gandalf hero haters UNITE!

How about no, how about we boost it in other ways and keep our cards! Hopefully Arwen will replace her in most decks now as they are somewhat similar and are the same sphere and threat cost. Scorpigorn on the other hand is really neat and that -1 def to enemies is really cool, inventive and unique for a hero ability.\n\nBG: Arwen Undomiel. Oh the new hero that I quickly misjudged yet ended up adding her to my decks and is AMAZING in them.

Spirit Merry is good too, but not good enough to beat a member of the White Council.\nBE: Gandalf v Boromir (T) - As much as I like Boromir, Gandalf's tricks are to much fun to not vote for him\nBF: Éowyn v Aragorn (T) - The other, even closer, hard matchup. Éowyn does work since the core set, but Aragorn's engage marathon is quite entertaining. In the end Éowyn has to many alternatives to make the cut and Aragorn vs Arwen would be a funny duell next round :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] \nBG: Arwen Undomiel v Théoden (S) - I don't really like Rohan Decks in general (execpt a Dunhere attack staging area deck) or any of the 2 Théodens. And Arwen seems like a pretty good hero. \n\nEdited December 13, 2015 by Calvadur"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1933065","commentId":1933065,"userName":"Elves of Ithilien","timestamp":1450035930,"content":"Glad to see the Hero Championship up and running this year.

Both very good heroes though, the closest matchup this round for me.\nBA: Frodo Baggins v Éomer: I like Eomer, but he never really worked for me. No ranged and having access only to Firefoot as +2 ATK cripples him. If we see something for him in the future he might make a big comeback though.\nBB: Aragorn (Lo) v Legolas: Loragorn threat shenanigans sometimes feel broken to me, but he's more entertaining to play and cannot be substituted for in decks, while the same is not true for Legolas.\nBC: Beregond v Haldir of Lorien: I could maybe fathom voting Mablung last time, but this time is not close at all. If you're playing a scenario with no punishing shadows, sure Beregond is nice. But if you do - most now have awful shadow effects - Beregond is not gonna help you much. Enemy attacks again. Enemy gains +X attack. Discard defending character (Hello Sudden Pitfall!). Deal damage to defending character. Hmm. Haldir on the other hand is the paradigm of safety: not only he kills the enemy, he prevents it from attacking! So no shadows, no need to declare a defender etc. etc. Haldir also solves a lot of situations in which you have a tough enemy you cannot take out of the staging area without some serious pain! Of course Haldir has his limitations (otherwise he would be too powerful), the biggest one perhpas being the need for at least a weapon (Bow/Blade), kinda forcing you to play Tactics. But he when he is geared up (and that's far from difficult to achieve), he owns. Plus the amazing flavor of course. Vote Haldir! Vote the Protector of Lorien!\nBE: Gandalf v Boromir (T). I feel like Gandalf doesn't break a whole game mechanic; rather, he bends the rules a little bit..\nBF: Éowyn v Aragorn (T). Aragorn (T) is a beast, Eowyn is boring. Both are kind of boring TBH, as Tactagorn very often makes games boring (he almost never get played in my group, especially not with Merry (T), just because he's too good). However of the two I enjoy more curshing a horde of enemies, rather than questing for 4 each and every round.\nBG: Arwen Undomiel v Théoden (S). She is awesome.

I honestly don't think Beregond is that great a defender, yeah he has all he right stats and sentinel and attachments are more or less free on him. I find that the main most detrimental things that you need to worry about when it comes to defending enemy attacks is extra attacks you weren't expecting or horrible shadow effects. Elrohir and Erkenbrand both combat these issues and so do other heroes. Beregond can't do jack against either of these threats unless you load him up with readying attachments and run x3 Behind Strong Walls or run lots of shadow cancellation (all of which take up deck slots and require you to actually draw them). Elrohir and Erkenbrand have these effects built in and are in my opinion far far better defenders. Legolas is definitely one of the best attackers hands down, yes his 3 attack and ranged is more or less the offensive version of Beregond's 4 defence and sentinel and yes his ability is to do with progress and not necessarily offense but attacking enemies is so much more straightforward than defending against them. There are no player shadow cards for example and we can attack with multiple characters against one enemy (can only ever block with one character at a time unless you run that one crappy event...) so you don't need to be quite as specialised or amazing to be a great attacker, you just need brute force and ranged. His progress ability is just insanely good as well and makes him, in a way, a great quester/progress placing hero as well. Beregond blocks and that's it folks!\n\nAlso 0 willpower just sucks, I think every hero needs to have at least 1... yes I know you will almost never quest with him but Erkenbrand can quest with snowmane or steed of the mark if you really want or are desperate and Elrohir can quest on certain turns that you play Naith Guide or Lembas for example and has 2 willpower! Also Beregond just cannot handle the cold, dies instantly if you ask him to accompany you through the redhorn gate, literally just straight up dies when you get near the top of the mountain! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nBJ: Elrond. I strongly recommend EVERYONE who hasn't voted vote for Elrond. Gandalf is better yes but he is better than any hero. Does everything, has more unique attachments than ANYONE and will probably receive his ring of power as well and I'm sure it like all his other attachments will be super powerful yet mega cheap to play.\n\nHe does everything, he can receive pretty much any attachment if its on top of your deck, draw a retarded amount of cards, discard shadow cards, gain resources, draw cards, abuse the HELL out of cards like treasure hunter and really just cheeses up the game in general. Want to beat a quest with next to no chance of losing whatsoever? Build a broken Gandalf deck! Want to play easy mode without actually playing easy mode? Use Gandalf!\n\nI know lots of people are gonna hate this rant and will disagree wholeheartedly but I know that many of you also agree and hate the abomination that is the gandalf hero!!\n\nDon't vote for Gandalf he has already won this whole tournament, he is clearly better than any other hero and was more or less designed to be exactly that. The best hero but with the highest threat cost. get. him. OUTTA HERE! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] \n\nBK: Aragorn (T). I have to say I am a little surprised it is the tactics aragorn that is the only aragorn that remains. I also have to say he gets my vote even if I barely used him when he came out.

I think it has been very accurate because of a large number of voters with thoughtfulness and experiance. The flashy new toys are not overvalued and the vocal propaganda being thrown around is often falling on deaf ears. I don't know who will win, but it will be well deserved.\n\nBH: Sam Gamgee. It is clear that Frodo cannot win the whole thing. If he has to go down, at least he can go down to his best friend and faithful companion, Sam.\n\nBI: Beregond. People are truly beginning to understand how much of a powerhouse Beregond is. With all due respect to other great defenders like Erkenbrand and Elrohir, Beregond is the best of the best. Soon he will be added to the list of heroes that the hipster players refuse to use because he trivialize the quests and makes the game boring. I can think of no greater honor.\n\nBJ: Gandalf. Other than the embarrassment that is Spirit Glorfindel, no other hero enraged the haters like Gandalf. The thing is, when Seastan builds his many broken decks that demand immediate errata I never seem to see Gandalf in the lineup. Interesting... Anyway, the more I play Gandalf the more I tip my hat to the designers for creating a masterpiece. The guy is supposed to be iconic and powerful and game changing and FUN. They were going to get hate no matter what, and they took on the challenge and made a card that honors the character. The biggest reason to vote for Gandalf is not because he is powerful, but because he is unique, creative, fun, and flavorful. Stick your finger in the eye of the haters and vote for the best hero in the game, Gandalf.\n\nBK: Théoden (S). I am shocked and pleased to see Theoden make it this far. He is the only hero left that grants a global buff to a particular tribe. Dain, Celeborn, Outlands guy--there all gone, but not Santa. Rohan is still my favorite tribe and I am glad to see that I am not alone in my love.\n\nI am throwing my support fully behind Gandalf now. I think he deserves to be the first repeat champion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1942626","commentId":1942626,"userName":"Greyhound78","timestamp":1450434021,"content":"BH: Sam Gamgee\n\nBI: Legolas\n\nBJ: Elrond\n\nBK: Theoden"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1942642","commentId":1942642,"userName":"Tomdidiot","timestamp":1450435395,"content":"BH: Sam\n\nBI: Beregrond\n\nBJ: Elrond\n\nBK: Tactics Aragorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1942809","commentId":1942809,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1450444222,"content":"BH: Sam Gamgee - dunno, just use him more.

That shoudn't happen too often if you build the deck right/play right, but it limits the heroes you can use, if you want to make safe use of Sam's ability. On the other hand if you run Frodo you usually have a lot of threat reducing effects (something I don't think is necessary in a Sam/Hobbit Deck) and don't care so much about a potential raise. Just commit Frodo to the quest (like Sam), if you get attacked simply raise your threat. There are attacks Frodo can defend, but Sam would just get slaughtered by., too. All in all for me it's Frodo > Sam in most decks (exceptions I can think of right know: Saga, Mono Leadership).\n\n \n\nBI: Legolas v Beregond\n\n \n\nClose call, but I prefer a good defense over spectacular offense. Beregond is really good in siege quests, too (high defense is not so common like attack).\n\n\nBJ: Elrond v Gandalf\n\n \n\nEven closer! Elrond and Gandalf are probably the two most powerfull heroes currently in the game. Both with strong stats, effects and personal toys, even Aragorn can't come close to. And both have an ally Version, which are both very good (Gandalf also has the OhauH incarnation :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]). It took me a while but in the end I will go with Elrond. Having 3 Armor and being a lore hero makes Elrond a great Defender, I would even say better than Beregond, as it's super easy to ignore any possible shadow Cards and get healing on the table, which is then even boosted! That Elronds helps you pay for all your allies is just the icing on the cake.\n\nGandalf adds 1 to your handsize, what is cool, but would only mean you drew 2 cards turn one and then play normally, IF Gandalf wouldn't be allowed to pay for your extra Card no matter what sphere AND (now we come to the main reason why Elrond > Gandalf) you couldn't do These I know the Card shenanigans: draw the Card with expert treasure hunter or Play the Card for free with Vilya. And that's it. In my opinion Elrond is the greater buff for Gandalf than vice versa. Of Course Gadlaf is cool and everything, but if I can't have both, I would take Elrond\n\n \n\nBK: Aragorn (T) v Théoden (S)\n\n \n\nEasy decision. As always Rohan won't get my vote. And Tactagorn is a really good hero.\n\n \n\n \n\nSome predictions: Next round will be Sam v Legolas and Elrond v Theoden, what will lead to a Sam v Elrond final, that the elf-lord will win. It's really cool, that we have two Oldies (Legolas, core set. and Elrond, shadow and flame) against to comparable fresh heroes (even though Sam is much older than Théoden (S) release-wise), what shows, that the community likes their old toys as much as their new ones.\n\nEdited December 18, 2015 by Calvadur"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1942947","commentId":1942947,"userName":"Calyx","timestamp":1450449778,"content":"BH: Sam Gamgee - I like Frodo a lot as well, but Sam seems to find himself in more of my decks.\n\nBI: Legolas - Legolas is a lot more fun to use than Beregond.

I choose to vote for the heros I feel would give me the best chance of winning against a difficult scenario unseen and try to leave personal bias out. Personally, I really love Frodo Baggins but no way does he deserve to be in this late.\n\nActually, I don't have any special fondness for Frodo, I've been voting for him primarily based on how powerful he is. Given Seastan used him to solo Carn Dum, I think he definitely fits the criteria of 'best chance of winning against a difficult scenario'. On favouritism I'd be voting for Sam, but for chance of winning I'd back Frodo against most of the other heroes in the game.\n\nIn the end though, those are not the criteria anyway. Obviously I can't speak for everyone, but I assume at least a lot of us vote like me based on a mixture of how we perceive the power level of the hero, how much fun we have playing with them, how much we like the character, how much we like the design, and so on. So I voted against Glorfindel because I find him boring, I voted against most Dwarf heroes because most of them only work in Dwarf decks and I like to play a bigger variety of stuff, I voted for Beorn because while he's not the most powerful hero he is incredibly fun to play around with, I'm voting now for Frodo because he's incredibly powerful and for Gandalf because he's incredibly powerful and fun and versatile. Sometimes favouritism will outweigh objective assessment of power level, but not always. And for that matter, we all have vastly different play experiences, so it's questionable as to whether we actually can give completely objective assessments. As already brought up, you try to vote entirely based on who you think would give you the best chances of winning and think Frodo shouldn't have made it this far, but I would back Frodo against most other heroes in the game on those criteria. Clearly we have wildly divergent experiences of playing with Frodo.\n\n \n\nI've made a couple of posts complaining about 'the wrong heroes winning', but in the end we all have different views on things, and that makes it interesting. I don't harbour any genuine negative feelings towards the many people who repeatedly vote the wrong way, so long as we all remain nice about it and don't go too far in deriding each others' favourite heroes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1943934","commentId":1943934,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1450470486,"content":"BH: Frodo Baggins\nBI: Legolas\nBJ: Gandalf\nBK: Théoden (S)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1943944","commentId":1943944,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1450470722,"content":"My votes aren't careful.  I see a matchup and pick the one I \"like\" the best.  It's a big synthesis of art, theme, how the ability works, how much fun I've had using that hero...\n\n \n\nI think power is one of the least important criteria for me.  I enjoy flexible heroes who tend not to be the most powerful, and underplayed heroes who present unique deckbuilding challenges."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1944180","commentId":1944180,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1450477803,"content":"I voted against Frodo this round because he ran into Sam, but Frodo absolutely deserved to go this far.

Beregond ist a simple, ressource-saving (very good) defender, who is only here, because he was matched against Legolas, who is a simple, progress-making (very good) attacker. There is no point speaking for Beregond in this matchup.\n\n \n\nBM: Gandalf v Théoden (S)\n\n \n\nI really don't get why Théoden gets all the love, but Dain, Celeborn, Hirluin and Boromir (Le) aren't even close to him. They all enable a specific trait (Rohan, dwarfs, Silvans, Outlands, Gondor) in more or less different ways (cost reduction, stat boost while ready, stat boost for 1 round after playing, paying for all spheres and getting buffed, stat boost while holding a ressource). I guess Théoden is just new and a Rohan-Deck wasn't that great without him.\n\nGandalf is a strong hero, who allows many cool and powerful combos. I guess many people just see the Gandalf-Elrond-Spiritfindel-Combo and claim, that Gandalf is OP. I would say that, if anything, Elrond and his ring are OP, even more with Gandalf. Having a 5 threat hero with awesome stats to complete the hero line-up helps too. Of Course this is the strongest deck you can build with Gandalf, but his balanced stats allow Gandalf to be part of any deck and his toys help him in this regard, as all of them can be used in different situations (the staff being a prime example).\n\nAll in all we have a Spirit-hero, who isn't that much different than the other trait enablers and sets-up a Rohan deck, against a flexible stat-powerhouse, who is often disliked, because a deck exists, in which his ability makes an other hero with his attachment completly absurd. Elrond should get the hate for making it possible to cheat every ally, attachment and some events into play for free, not Gandalf, who, if not combined with expert-treasure hunter, only gives you ONE more card to play with during the entire game (seeing the next card in your deck and being able to play it equals one extra card drawn at the beginning of the game, as the card on top of your deck would be the one in your hand, from your latest draw)\n\n \n\nI'm sorry if this reads like a little rant, I just don't understand why some people vote against Gandalf for being OP/boring :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]\n\nEdited December 23, 2015 by Calvadur"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1952504","commentId":1952504,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1450883531,"content":"w8f26.jpg [https://i.imgflip.com/w8f26.jpg]  w8fdy.jpg [https://i.imgflip.com/w8fdy.jpg]\n\nEdited December 23, 2015 by gandalfDK"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194686-the-hero-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1952547","commentId":1952547,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1450884434,"content":"BL: Sam Gamgee - While Beregond stood out fom Legolas for great defence being a lot rarer than good attack, pitted against Sam I have to give the vote for the Hobbit's versatility.\n\n \n\nBM: Gandalf - All the love for Theoden has made me think I should probably try again to build a decent Rohan deck with him, but again, versatility.

He is \"old news\" now.  He may eventually win if people choose to vote against previous winners because they don't want to have the same hero win twice.  This happened to Galadriel this year so it wouldn't surprise me if it happens to each successive winner.  Although, I have a feeling Sam will be immune to this effect due to people voting for him because they see him as the \"underdog\" even though he is evidently the top dog.\n\n \n\nWe also will never have a Dwarf winner (unless they release a new, relatively strong one right around the time this tournament is hosted).
