When such a card leaves play, one player should.....\n\n \n\nMy question is:\n\nCan a card be considered defeated even if it has no effect..... example a Hill Troll as a shadow card(do i get the victory points???)...\n\nOK, obviously a monster is considered defeated if killed by any means and a location is considered defeated if it is explored....\n\n \n\nMy question is based on the card Hummerhorn which has Victory Points. It has a really nasty shadow effect that can make you loose the game or cripples you real bad. Now OK if i kill the hummerhorn i get the VP for sure but what if i draw Hummerhorn as a shadow card and it takes effect??? Shouldn't i get the VP for surviving such a thing???\n\n \n\nP.S. So far i am only counting as VP only killed and explored locations because i want to be fair with my results but Hummerhorns shadow effect with VP has got me into thinking.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50288-question-about-cards-with-the-victory-keyword-specifically-hummerhorn/?do=findComment&comment=502754","commentId":502754,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1311309902,"content":"No, you need to defeat it in combat.
