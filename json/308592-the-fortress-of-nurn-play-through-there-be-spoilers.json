Forced: When this quest becomes the current quest, reveal the faceup encounter card under it. Then, flip this card over and make it the current quest until the end of the phase.\n\n \n\n\"Place the top card of The Power of Mordor deck faceup under each side quest in play.\"\n\n1st side quest gets Covered in Darkness (Doomed 5. Each player's threat cannot be reduced by more than 1 each round by player card effects.)\n\n2nd side quest gets The Armies of Mordor (Forced: After a non-unique enemy engages a player, that enemy cannot take damage until the end of the round.)\n\n3rd side quest gets Khamul the Easterling (49 engagement cost, 4 threat, 6 attack, 4 defense and 9 hit points.

Onward to 1B (3 QP).\n\nThane Ulchor cannot leave the staging area.\n\nWhile there are at least 3 progress tokens on this stage, it cannot be chosen as the current quest during the quest phase.\n\nThis stage cannot be defeated unless it is the end of the round and there are 3 Castle side quests in the victory display.\n\n \n\nTurn 1\n\nEngaged with Ulchor's Guard (25 engagement cost, 2 threat, 4 attack, 1 defense, 4 hit points.)\n\nRP: Draws Song of Travel (reveals Dagger of Westernesse)\n\nPP: Plays Dagger of Westernesse from the top of the deck. Glorfindel buffs his attack to 4 (potentially 5). War Axe and Strider on Eowyn (now 6 WP and 2 attack). Song of Travel on Gandalf. Saves 1 resource on Eowyn (for Quick Strike).\n\nQP. Staging Area: Thane Ulchor (1)\n\nDecides to quest on SQ2, triggering forced effect (When this quest becomes the current quest, reveal the faceup encounter card under it. Then, flip this card over and make it the current quest until the end of the phase.) Puts into staging area The Armies of Mordor (Forced: After a non-unique enemy engages a player, that enemy cannot take damage until the end of the round.) Flips side quest and reveals Castle Garrison (Discard cards from the top of the encounter deck until X enemies are discarded, where X is the number of players. Add each enemy discarded this way to the staging area.) Discards 4 cards before adding to the staging area Mordor Olog-Hai (34 engagement cost, 4 threat, 6 attack, 3 defense, 9 hit points. Cannot have attachments. Forced: After Mordor Olog-Hai attacks and destroys a character you control, exhaust a character you control.)\n\nStaging area: Thane Ulchor (1), Mordor Olog-Hai (4)\n\nSends Eowyn and Glorfindel for 9 WP. Raises threat by 1 (26) - no Light of Valinor.\n\nReveals Guard Tower (2) which reads: While Guard Tower is in the staging area, players cannot draw cards or gain resources from player card effects.\n\n9 WP vs 7 threat = 2 progress on Castle Garrison\n\nTP: Travels to Guard Tower (Travel cost: Each player exhausts a character he controls) and exhausts Gandalf.  All heroes now exhausted.\n\nEP: No way I'm engaging Mordor Olog-Hai this early.\n\nCP: Deals shadow to engaged Ulchor's Guard. Uses Eowyn's action, readies her and raises threat by 3 (29), plays Quick Strike and kills Ulchor's Guard (11 attack vs 1 defense and 5 hit points)\n\nRP: raises threat by 1 (30). No hero damaged, yet.\n\n \n\nTurn 2\n\nRP: Draws Raiment of War (reveals Feint)\n\nPP: Plays Rivendell Blade on Glorfindel, Unexpected Courage and Raiment of War on Gandalf, Warrior Sword on Eowyn (3 attack now, 4 or 5 when engaged with an enemy or two). Each hero now has two restricted attachments.\n\nQP. Staging area: The Armies of Mordor, Thane Ulchor (1), Mordor Olog-Hai (4)\n\nExhausts Eowyn and Glorfindel to quest on Castle Garrison which has 6 quest points.  9 WP + 1 threat penalty (31).\n\nReveals Catacombs (4) with text: While Catacombs is in the staging area, enemies in the staging area cannot take damage.\n\n9 WP vs 9 threat = 0 progress\n\nEP: Forced to engage Mordor Olog-Hai to remove threat from the staging area.\n\nCP: Deals shadow to Mordor Olog-Hai, Gandalf defends with 4. Shadow card is The Dark Lord's Reach with effect: Discard an attachment you control. Discards Song of Travel. Gandalf suffers 2 damage. Nothing else I can do, Mordor Olog-Hai cannot take damage because of the forced effect on The Armies of Mordor in the staging area. Plus, I would've done just 1 damage and he has 9 hit points!\n\nRP: raises threat by 1 (32) and flips the contract (Gandalf 5WP, Eowyn 8 WP, Glorfindel 5 WP)\n\n \n\nTurn 3\n\nRP: Draws Feint (reveals the last card in the deck, Firefoot)\n\nPP: Plays Firefoot from the top of the deck on Eowyn (9 WP, 5 attack now). Pays with Gandalf's resource, saving Eowyn's for Feint.\n\nQP. Staging Area: The Armies of Mordor, Thane Ulchor (1), Catacombs (4)\n\nExhausts Eowyn and Glorfindel to quest on Castle Garrison which has 6 quest points.  14 WP + 1 threat penalty (32).\n\nReveals Soldier of Nurn (28 engagement cost, 2 threat, 3 attack, 1 defense, 4 hit points. Forced: After Soldier of Nurn attacks, place 1 card from your hand facedown under a Castle side quest.)\n\n14 WP vs 7 threat = 7 progress (4 on Guard Tower, 3 on Castle Garrison (5/6))\n\nTP: Travels to Catacombs which has 4 QP. (Travel: Each player discards the top card of the encounter deck. If a player discards an enemy this way, he puts into play engaged with him.) Discards the top card, it's treachery, so no new enemies. Phew.\n\nEP: Engages Soldier of Nurn\n\nCP: Deals shadow to Mordor Olog-Hai and Soldier of Nurn. Plays Feint on Mordor Olog-Hai. Declares Gandalf as defender and uses Unexpected Courage to ready him. No shadow effect (Plaza of Nurn). 3 attack vs 4 defense = 0 damage on Gandalf. I don't place 1 card from my hand facedown under a Castle side quest because I don't have any in my hand. My hand and my deck are empty. Gandalf whacks Mordor Olog-Hai (3 defense) and does 1 damage. Splendid! Uses the contract and heals Gandalf for 1 damage. 1 remaining.\n\nRP: raises threat by 1 (33)\n\n \n\nTurn 4\n\nRP: nothing happens, my deck is gone!\n\nPP: nothing happens, my hand is gone!\n\nQP. Staging Area: The Armies of Mordor, Thane Ulchor (1)\n\nExhausts Eowyn and Glorfindel to quest on Castle Garrison which has 6 quest points.  14 WP + 1 threat penalty (34).\n\nReveals Guard Dogs (12 engagement cost, 1 threat, 2 attack, 1 defense and 2 hit points. Surge. Forced: After Guard Dogs engages you, deal 1 damage to a character you control.) surges into yet another Catacombs (4). Unbelievable!\n\n14 WP vs 6 threat = 8 progress (4 on Catacombs, 4 on Castle Garrison).\n\nCastle Garrison goes to the victory display and Thane Ulchor gets +1 threat. I get back Feint, Shadowfax, Snowmane, Herugrim, Gondorian Shield, Rivendell Blade, Light of Valinor, Wizard Pipe. I shuffle the cards into an empty deck and draw Light of Valinor (Ouch! Was hoping for Feint.)\n\nTP: Travels to Catacombs which has 4 QP. (Travel: Each player discards the top card of the encounter deck. If a player discards an enemy this way, he puts into play engaged with him.) Discards the top card, it's locations, so no new enemies. Again, phew.\n\nEP: Engages Guard Dogs. Forced effect trigger, deals 1 damage to Eowyn.\n\nCP: Deals shadow cards to Mordor Olog-Hai, Soldier of Nurn and Guard Dogs. Declares Gandalf as defender against Mordor Olog-Hai and uses Unexpected Courage to ready him. 6 attack against 4 defense = 2 damage (now 3/6 damage). No shadow effect.  Guard Dogs attack goes undefended. Shadow effect: Attacking enemy gets +1 attack for each Castle side quest in the victory display. Ouch. 3 damage on Glorfindel (3/5). Gandalf defends Soldier of Nurn. 3 attack vs 4 defense = 0 damage. Shadow effect: If this attack destroys a character, resolve the Travel effect on the active location. Nothing happens. But because of the forced effect on Soldier of Nurn, I must put my hard won Light of Valinor under SQ4. No cards in hand. Again!\n\nUses the contract to heal heroes (Gandalf 2/6, Eowyn 0, Glorfindel 2/5)\n\nRP: raises threat by 1 (35)\n\n \n\nTurn 5\n\nRP: Draws Shadowfax (reveals Rivendell Blade)\n\nPP: Plays Rivendell Blade form the top of the deck on Glorfindel (6 WP now), and reveals Herugrim. Plays Shadowfax on Gandalf.\n\nQP. Staging Area: The Armies of Mordor, Thane Ulchor (2)\n\nExhausts Eowyn to quest on main quest (3 QP) for 9 WP.\n\nReveals treachery Ulchor's Rage with the text: Thane Ulchor makes an immediate attack against the first player. If no attack is made this way, Ulchor's Rage gains surge. Perfect! Deals shadow to Ulchor and declares Gandalf as defender. Uses Shadowfax to ready him. Shadow card is another Ulchor's Rage with the effect Deal 1 damage to the defending character. Gandalf now 3/6. 6 attack vs 4 defense = 2 damage. Gandalf 5/6.\n\nBecause of Ulchor's forced effect (After Thane Ulchor attacks, reveal the top card of the encounter deck) reveals Ulchor's Guard (how appropriate!).\n\nStaging area now has The Armies of Mordor, Thane Ulchor (2), Ulchor's Guard (2)\n\n9 WP vs 4 threat = 5 progress on main quest\n\nEP: Engages Ulchor's Guard.\n\nCP: Deals shadow to Mordor Olog-Hai, Soldier of Nurn, Ulchor's Guard, and Guard Dogs. Exhausts contract to heal 1 damage off of Gandalf (4/6) and Glorfindel (1/5). Guard Dogs attack goes undefended. Shadow is Ulchor's Rage (again!). 2 damage on Glorfindel (3/5). Gandalf defends Soldier of Nurn. 3 attack vs 4 defense = 0 damage. No shadow. Gandalf defends against Mordor Olog-Hai which gets Mordor Olog-Hai for a shadow card. Its effect: Attacking enemy gets +2 attack. That's 8 attack vs 4 defense = 4 damage. Dead Wizard. Game over.\n\n \n\nWhat a spectacular defeat. Next time I'll try with my other 3 Hunters deck. Well, that was a small sample of the quest. At the end, I felt I barely scratched the surface."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308592-the-fortress-of-nurn-play-through-there-be-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=3943118","commentId":3943118,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1590162239,"content":"Is there an end to the story?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308592-the-fortress-of-nurn-play-through-there-be-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=3943119","commentId":3943119,"userName":"Preotet","timestamp":1590162292,"content":"You mean in the rule sheet?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308592-the-fortress-of-nurn-play-through-there-be-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=3943122","commentId":3943122,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1590162457,"content":"Yep, in the accompanying story notes. \n\nBearing in mind this is the last AP before hiatus, I just wondered if they brought it to a final conclusion. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308592-the-fortress-of-nurn-play-through-there-be-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=3943127","commentId":3943127,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1590163239,"content":"Rip, lotr lcg..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308592-the-fortress-of-nurn-play-through-there-be-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=3943136","commentId":3943136,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1590164221,"content":"Sure looks hard!
