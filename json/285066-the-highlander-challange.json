I suggest to just treat it as a harder variant of the game rather than something that needs to be balanced to the player deck to encounter deck strenght ratio is unchanged. It's for players that seek a deckbuilding and gameplay challenge. \n\nLet's see what we can come up with. Share your decks and scores against particular scenarios!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285066-the-highlander-challange/?do=findComment&comment=3513115","commentId":3513115,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1540378698,"content":"I already try to play only one exemplar of each card, but it was with 50 cards, in a vilya deck with some tutors.

I'm curious if people can come up with anything more interesting than \"1x of a bunch of tutors and draw, then 1x of a bunch of generally good cards\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285066-the-highlander-challange/?do=findComment&comment=3513241","commentId":3513241,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1540388554,"content":"In noldor it is much more a \"I draw tons of cards anyway\", the only card that make a real differences are to the sea! to the sea and steward of gondor because resources generation rules. And eventually elven-light. It is less goodstuff than vilya since you play a lot of noldor stuff. But it may be harder to do a 85 instead of 50 cards deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285066-the-highlander-challange/?do=findComment&comment=3513416","commentId":3513416,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1540395240,"content":"With Gandalf/Elrond/Denethor you can have Heed the Dream, Word of Command, Gather information, and Vilya itself in your deck.

That's close to the build for 50 cards I build. And that fit exactly to the definition of many tutors and drawing element and the rest is good stuff cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285066-the-highlander-challange/?do=findComment&comment=3513513","commentId":3513513,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1540400222,"content":"You could also include Steward to put on Elrond, so with Gandalf and Denethor's resource you could still play up to a 5-cost ally off the top of your deck every turn if you don't find Vilya/tutors.\n\nEdited October 24, 2018 by Seastan"}]}
