Emyn Arnen Ranger will definitely help in my thematic deck for Journey to the Cross-roads, and I enjoy different pairings of traits.\n\nWhile Cirith Gurat (from the fifth adventure pack) is an FFG-created location, The Crossings of Poros is not. The Poros is a river that started in the Mountains of Shadow and flowed west, joining the Anduin shortly before the Anduin flowed into the sea. It was the border between Ithilien and South Gondor (also called Harondor), which is described in Tolkien's map of Middle Earth as \"now a debatable and desert land.\" In T.A. 2885 (five years before Bilbo was born), while Túrin II was the 23rd Ruling Steward of Gondor, Appendix A tells us:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> [Túrin's] chief peril lay in the south, where the Haradrim had occupied South Gondor, and there was much fighting along the Poros. When Ithilien was invaded in great strength, King Folcwine of Rohan fulfilled the Oath of Eorl and repaid his debt for the aid brought by Beregond [20th Ruling Steward], sending many men to Gondor. With their aid Túrin won a victory at the crossings of the Poros; but the sons of Folcwine both fell in the battle. The Riders buried them after the fashion of their people, and they were laid in one mound, for they were twin brothers. Long it stood, Haudh in Gwanûr, high upon the shore of the river, and the enemies of Gondor feared to pass it.\n\nFolcred and Fastred, sons of Folcwine, were Théoden's great-uncles. I wonder whether there will be a reference to Haudh in Gwanûr in the quest.\n\n> 7 hours ago, Teamjimby said:\n> \n> another Ent hero?  Predictions?\n\nTreebeard mentions the three oldest Ents in Fangorn: himself, Leaflock and Skinbark. He says:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Only three remain of the first Ents that walked in the woods before the Darkness: only myself, Fangorn, and Finglas and Fladrif - to give them their Elvish names; you may call them Leaflock and Skinbark if you like that better.  And of us three Leaflock and Skinbark are not much use for this business. Leaflock has grown sleepy, almost tree-ish, you might say: he has taken to standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the deep grass of the meadows round his knees. Covered with leafy hair he is. He used to rouse up in winter; but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far even then. Skinbark lived on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard. That is where the worst trouble has been. He was wounded by the Orcs, and many of his folk and his tree-herds have been murdered and destroyed. He has gone up into the high places, among the birches that he loves best, and he will not come down. Still, I daresay I could get together a fair company of our younger folks\n\nThere's no evidence that either Leaflock or Skinbark participated in the attack on Isengard. So far we've gotten a Skinbark card, but no Leaflock card (which fits with Leaflock being more passive). The likeliest candidate for a new Ent hero is Quickbeam, but I could see us getting another version of Treebeard, or else Leaflock or Skinbark."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242066-the-crossings-of-poros/?do=findComment&comment=2630621","commentId":2630621,"userName":"Mazarbul","timestamp":1486549761,"content":"I added three copies of the Trap and the Ranger to my modified Dúnedain Trappers deck with Loragorn, Damrod and Amarthiul (based on Seastan's great deck) and they are amazing! You forest snare a 3-4 threat enemy and then the Rangers quest for a lot and a couple of those tactics traps almost always negate the threat in the staging area to being with."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242066-the-crossings-of-poros/?do=findComment&comment=2631237","commentId":2631237,"userName":"Willange","timestamp":1486575723,"content":"> 16 hours ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> This pack looks really exciting.

From Heirs of Numenor onwards you are correct though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242066-the-crossings-of-poros/?do=findComment&comment=2633167","commentId":2633167,"userName":"Estel Edain","timestamp":1486668586,"content":"Shadows of Mirkwood and Khazad-Dum added together balance: 8 heroes, with two from each sphere. Dwarrowdelf has two Tactics heros and two Lore heroes, so at the end of a cycle those spheres typically have one more hero than Leadership and Spirit (though the Saga expansions since Treason of Saruman have unbalanced that; if we get two non-Fellowship heroes in The Mountain of Fire, one Leadership and one Tactics, then the Saga expansions will have a perfect sphere balance in their heroes)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242066-the-crossings-of-poros/?do=findComment&comment=2634992","commentId":2634992,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1486757990,"content":"So what do we think the exact text of \"Followed\" is?  My guess:\n\nFollowed\n\nCondition.

You used to have to find room for spirit cards in your deck to get decent willpower, which meant making room for Idraen or songs or Celebrain's Stone. Now you just drop a 1-cost trap (free with Damrod) and it can quest for 3 pretty easily, and now you have a bunch of 2-cost lore allies that also quest for 3 and have 2 hit points. "}]}
