Part of the challenge in LOTR is saving up enough of the right resources and knowing when to spend and on what. LOTR requires all resources to match the sphere of the card being played, so there is definitely some strategy required to be good at that aspect of the game (i.e., resource management). Blue Mountain Trader completely eliminates that consideration in multiplayer. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125749-bleu-mountain-trader-today/?do=findComment&comment=1313643","commentId":1313643,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1414451438,"content":"A French dwarf!  Who knew?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125749-bleu-mountain-trader-today/?do=findComment&comment=1313831","commentId":1313831,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1414466690,"content":"I kinda wonder if Blue Mountain Trader was fully intentional. Maybe the designers saw too many people playing solo and wanted to give people a reason to play multiplayer by granting this huge boon in multiplayer. They knew that people who don't need the card would skip over it, so it's also designed to grant weaker players some help. Obviously, I cant verify any of this, but I dont see an issue with it's existence since this is a coop game and we dont NEED to have the power cards to win."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125749-bleu-mountain-trader-today/?do=findComment&comment=1314607","commentId":1314607,"userName":"-nebur-","timestamp":1414520906,"content":"I agree, that he is very powerfull...and that we need a limitation for his ability.\n\n \n\nOnce per round is to weak...he would become useless in my eyes.\n\n \n\nBut once per round per player could be good...so everybody could change 1 ress between 2 of their heroes.\n\n(Or limit x times per round...x = number of players)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125749-bleu-mountain-trader-today/?do=findComment&comment=1315306","commentId":1315306,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1414573126,"content":"Isn't that how the \"Once per round\" is ruled at the moment.

Therefore, Bifur cannot gain more than 1 resource from his effect each round. The type of effects that can be triggered by each player that Nate was talking about in his answer were “per game” effects. He identifies that in his answer regarding Landrovals ability when he says: “Per Game” limits are not card specific… His answer needs to be taken as a whole, not just chopped down to: “Limits are player specific…”  He gave that answer in response to specific question about a “per game” limit. It should not be misconstrued to mean that every limit in the game is player specific. Effects with ‘per phase’ & ‘per round’ limit work as they are written.\n> http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1217122/bifur [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1217122/bifur]\n\nEdited October 29, 2014 by alogos"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125749-bleu-mountain-trader-today/?do=findComment&comment=1316557","commentId":1316557,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1414664671,"content":"Aha, thanks Alagos!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125749-bleu-mountain-trader-today/?do=findComment&comment=1329360","commentId":1329360,"userName":"Courchevel","timestamp":1415644411,"content":"For me, only playing in multiplayer, I just found me and my friends not willing to integrate it into decks.
