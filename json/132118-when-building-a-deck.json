Can i still play and attach this to the gondor hero because I still have my tactics hero in play even tho its not going on my tactics hero?\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\nMany thanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132118-when-building-a-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1408887","commentId":1408887,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1421410078,"content":"yah, If I understand you your asking whether you can play attachments on heroes not of the sphere of the hero the attachment is played on and the answer is yes.  unless, in the case of for instance, burning brand, you can only play it on lore heroes.  so unless the card says otherwise, then the answer is yes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132118-when-building-a-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1408952","commentId":1408952,"userName":"muttlee","timestamp":1421414616,"content":"Excellent, 1 example I can think of is the steward on gondor attachment which states\n\nattached to a hero\n\nAttached hero gains gondor trait\n\nExhaust steward of gondor to apply 2 resource tokens to a hero\n\nSo let's say i have hero Sam who is of the correct sphere for me to play steward of gondor So I could add this to let's say legolas who is of the tactics sphere."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132118-when-building-a-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1409091","commentId":1409091,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1421421921,"content":"Yes, don't forget that this one is Unique (the star icon before the name) which means only 1 can be in play at anytime.\n\nAlso, the ressource will be on legolas, and will be used for tactics cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132118-when-building-a-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1409588","commentId":1409588,"userName":"muttlee","timestamp":1421441000,"content":"Many thanks guys, has helped out with my deck building.

Ian of Tales from the Cards gives a nice overview of each pack if you were to buy selectively.

That way you can grow into the game more easily imo."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132118-when-building-a-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1413851","commentId":1413851,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1421752406,"content":"Khazad-Dûm and the Dwarrowdelf cycle, definitely.
