He only becomes a hero as soon as he enters play. In the process of playing him (paying his cost) he would still be an ally and the contract woudn't allow it. You might be able to get him down using Vilya maybe. I'm not 100% on this.\n\nHe's what it says in the online rules reference on constant abilities:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Page 5.\n> \n> Constant Abilities\n> \n> A constant ability is any non-keyword ability whose text contains no boldface timing trigger defining its ability type. A constant ability becomes active as soon as its card enters play and remains active while the card is in play.\n> \n>  * Some constant abilities continuously seek a specific condition (denoted by words such as “during,” “if,” or “while”). The effects of such abilities are active any time the specified condition is met.\n>  * If multiple instances of the same constant ability are in play, each instance affects the game state independently.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304615-hero-thalion-and-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=3873538","commentId":3873538,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1579236044,"content":"Stimpaksam is right. Also Vilya definitely doesn't work because the contract forbids putting into play as well.\n\nThe text on Glorfindel and Emery is only in effect because those abilities specifically reference the cards entering play from other areas.\n\nIn fact, if Thalion's effect applied in your hand then you would never be able to play him once you had three sidequests completed - the game rules do not permit you to play Heroes from your hand. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304615-hero-thalion-and-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=3874069","commentId":3874069,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1579289885,"content":"I'm inclined to agree with the previous two posts, but to play devils advocate...\n\nThe cards text seems to be active even in hand. It is not a response. It is a passive ability that stays on the card. Why wouldn't the status be in effect while in hand?
