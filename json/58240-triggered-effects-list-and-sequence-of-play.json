Therefore, the \"When X attacks\" would apply only at step 4, during the calculation of the combat damage. This lead me to think that this \"When X attacks trigger\" is applied not at a particular step of the Enemy Attack sequence, but during the sequence as a whole, and that it also depends on which condition follows the \"When X attacks\" trigger. The fact it is Forced means it cannot be cancelled with a Response or a subsequent Player action then."}]}
