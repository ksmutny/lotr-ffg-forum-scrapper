Yes - during staging, you reveal 1 card per player from the encounter deck.  Every single other rule works exactly the same when you have only one player - the only thing to keep in mind is that with few exceptions, certain abilities (i.e., ranged, sentinel),  don't really provide any benefit in solo play.\n\n2. Forest Spider gains +1 attack strength on the round it engages a player no matter who engages it, or whatever the reason may be (i.e., optionally engaging it or it comes after you/whomever because you meet its engagement threshold).  Hummerhorns does 5 damage to a single hero that the player that it is engaged with controls (the other player suffers no injury).\n\n3. Here's a link to a good timing sequence flowchart [http://tinyurl.com/c6wj8ro].  \"Actions\" and \"responses\" are different, and typically only \"responses\" are reactionary in nature, i.e., there is a triggering event, and you can play a response in reaction to it if it.  An example would be A Test of Will - you reveal a treachery card during staging, and while you cannot normally take \"actions\" at that time, you are entirely free to use A Test of Will's \"response\" to react to the treachery card by canceling its \"when revealed\" effects.  In your specific example, you could use A Test of Will as a response to cancel Eyes of the Forest before it causes players to discard all event cards (i.e., A Test of Will), from their hands.  Think of a \"response\" as an \"interrupt\" effect, whereas \"actions\" are just general abilities that aren't quite as quick to occur.\n\nIf you have any other questions, I'm sure everyone here should be glad to help out!\n\nedit: beaten, ****!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56278-briareos-home-for-stupid-questions/?do=findComment&comment=555876","commentId":555876,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1321285271,"content":"Briareos200 said:\n\n \n\n1.  For solo games the only main rules difference is that during the quest phase you only reveal one card from the encounter deck.  Everything else works the same?  (obviously some card effects are pointless in single player or can only target yourself.  Ranged is pointless for example.\n\n2.  For cards like Forest Spider which reads (FORCED: After forest spider engages a player it gets +1 attack until end of phase) does that mean that the spider gets +1 reguardless of who engages the player or the spider during a check?  Another example is I believe that Hummerhorns only does 5 damage to a hero when it engages during a check not if the player choose to engage correct?\n\n3.  Now for a timing question.  Only reactions can respond to an effect right?  If eyes of the forest is revealed during the quest phase the players cannot play any event cards they can afford before having to discard them right?\n\n \n\n \n\nSvenn and Lightdarker beat me to it but I'm not deleting all of this so you get a double whammy.\n\n1. Keep Ranged in mind for Journey to Rhosgobel. Some of the critters in that scenario can only be attacked or defended against with Eagles or Ranged characters.\n\n2. Forest Spider and Hummerhorns effects would apply at any time that they engage a player. If either one were to return to the Staging Area and then Engage a player again or if they switched from one player to another through any card effects, their effects would apply again when engaging again.\n\nSon of Arnor is the best example of this. If Son of Arnor is used to pull Forest Spider or Hummerhorns away from one player and causes them to engage the person who played Son of Arnor, their effects would apply when they engage the new player. Forest Spider would get +1 Attack strength again for that first engagement phase that they were engaged with the new player and Hummerhorns would deal damage to a hero.\n\nOptionally choosing to engage an enemy doesn't avoid the enemy's effects. Optionally choosing to engage is just a way for players to grab particularly dangerous enemies that might be heading for another player during the upcoming engagement checks or for a solo player to grab an enemy that wouldn't be engaging them this round automatically during the engagement check step due to the enemy's threat cost vs. the players threat total.\n\n3. No, you could play that Spirit event card to cancel the \"When Revealed\" effect on the Treachery Card as far as I'm aware. So Events can be played in response to cards being revealed. Otherwise that particular event would be useless as there would be no window for it to ever be used.

Anyway, it seems to me that the game designers understood the importance of the first hand and that's why they allow a redraw for your starting 6 cards if you don't like your first hand (the mulligan). Having not played any other FFG games, that may just be a standard rule, but to me it offsets the importance of \"first draw\" just enough to be acceptable. Is the game still hard? Absolutely. But I think the random element is something that must be accepted if you play card and dice games.\n\nAs for free resources, I don't think that solves the problem because there are two limiting factors at the beginning. One is resource availability, as you've mentioned, and the other is card draw, which you alluded to. Gaining extra resources will help you to afford the cards in your starting hand, but you would also burn through them much faster and you'd be starved for cards the duration of the game unless you had more card-draw abilities (which I typically don't as a Spirit player). To \"solve\" the problem you'd have to add more resources and more cards to draw during the resource phase. Do I think these changes would ensure a win? No. But I think winning would be much easier. In games where you had a good starting hand you would dominate the encounter deck and to me it would feel like a hollow victory."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56278-briareos-home-for-stupid-questions/?do=findComment&comment=575210","commentId":575210,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1325771364,"content":"mandrill_one said:\n\n I'll probably establish some sort of record with TWO stupid questions at once...\n\n \n\n1.

People post deck lists here but they get lost as the FFG forum is so terrible. The site is not usedas much as it shoud be but it is there. It also has a online deck editor and a card database.

I've been reading up on the game for a few days now, it'll be arriving tomorrow, and I'm quite excited to get started.\n\n1) Just how important is getting a second Core Set? I'm coming from playing A Game of Thrones, and for that game, the standard advice for every new player is that purchasing a second Core Set is the first thing you should do after the initial investment. Successful deck-building isn't all that possible without the extra cards from that second set. But the AGOT Core Set is almost entirely singletons, so you don't really end up with nearly as many extraneous cards with that purchase. Once I've played with my Core Set enough that I'm comfortable with the game and ready to make a bigger investment, should I be aiming at the Core again or are the Adventure Packs a higher priority?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI've been playing with a single core set for a while without issues, and a number of good cards come in pairs anyway. I'd aim for adventure packs after that, and keep an eye out for a site called the 13thfloor if you're from the UK, as they are likely to be selling single cards, and these guys come highly recommended! Excellent customer service.\n\nSo, stick with a core set for the first few quests, then consider adventure packs! My take is unless you're really hard-core about getting duplicates of specific cards, you've damaged the set, or want a 4 player game, don't go out of your way for another core set."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56278-briareos-home-for-stupid-questions/?do=findComment&comment=576821","commentId":576821,"userName":"Mechanoise","timestamp":1326100789,"content":"alpha5099 said:\n\nStill working on finding a deck that can beat Journey Down the Anduin.

I think my biggest problem was I had been using fairly high threat heroes, which meant I had to engage the Hill Troll right away, which just increased my threat even further from all the excess damage. I switched over to a low-threat deck, and I've had good success with a Spirit/Leadership/Lore deck. Been using Eowyn and Theodred consistently, and mainly started with Denethor, but last night I gave Beravor a spin and things sped up considerably. The biggest problem so far is that it can take a me a while to build up enough allies, so it's a slow turtling approach. I've beaten the quest twice with Denethor, and that took 18 and 19 turns each time, while playing with Beravor got me down to ten."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56278-briareos-home-for-stupid-questions/?do=findComment&comment=577311","commentId":577311,"userName":"Mechanoise","timestamp":1326180206,"content":"booored said:\n\n \n\nyou can not attack the same enemy twice with the same card, but UC allows you to attack multipul enemies with the one hero.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSvenn said:\n\n \n\nThis is incorrect, as booored pointed out.
