The phrase \"You are not eliminated\" does not depend on the actual lowering of the threat. So what if there was already one in the staging area when a doomed card got revealed?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195716-favor-of-the-valar-outlying-homestead/?do=findComment&comment=1932471","commentId":1932471,"userName":"awp832","timestamp":1449987606,"content":"^  Haha.   Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.   So assuming that was the case, theoretically you could stack threat forever, because you're eliminated when your threat crosses the 50 threshold, the game doesn't necessarily specify what happens afterward.   \n\nAlthough of course that's nitpicking,  the point is that it's not entirely clear what is supposed to happen afterward.  Eliminated again at every instance of threat increase beyond 50?  Seems logical,  but not written down anywhere.\n\nAlso logical would be to presume that the writers meant that you're only not eliminated with Favor of the Valar if your threat ends up being below 50, although the phrasing on the card does not give that impression.\n\nEdited December 13, 2015 by awp832"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195716-favor-of-the-valar-outlying-homestead/?do=findComment&comment=1932560","commentId":1932560,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1449997223,"content":"Well, whether you can lower your threat or not, you're still forced to discard Favour of the Valar, at which point its text is inactive and since your threat is then still over the elimination level, you are then eliminated."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195716-favor-of-the-valar-outlying-homestead/?do=findComment&comment=1938959","commentId":1938959,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1450278450,"content":"2 suggestions : Thror's key (such an underused card) or Saruman."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195716-favor-of-the-valar-outlying-homestead/?do=findComment&comment=1940732","commentId":1940732,"userName":"DurinVoronwe","timestamp":1450350275,"content":"Saruman raise threat too, so the Saruman idea is not as good as Thrors Key.\n\n \n\nJust remembered a thing...\n\nSaruman with Favor means threat lowering...\n\nValar likes the White wizard!"}]}
