As for the picture, it looks like it Lore. It's definitely not Leadership or Tactics obviously, but it doesn't look like spirit either… At least not on my screen. It's either Lore or Neutral, though I highly doubt them introducing a Neutral hero anytime soon. I can't really tell if the defense is 3 or 1… Oh well. Guess we'll wait and see when it comes out.

If it is Samwise, it is bound to be Spirit. And it does indeed look like him (in a very film-like; and it is hard to completely run away from those for many artists; and the art for the film was so good that to me, usually, the art that is resembling the films looks better - not that I would want the game's art resemble the movies). Now, if there's Bilbo though, what would he be? I cannot imagine him being anything but Lore. Can we have another Lore Bilbo? Sure. Leadership and Tactics do feel rather awkward for Hobbits but there's already Hobbit Cloak (Leadership, previewed) and Ring Mail (Tactics - for a Hobbit). I can imagine Merry being Leadership, he sorts of leads the group (acting like a guide) at least until they reach Bombadil; and Fatty could be nicely fit for Tactics, no willpower and perhaps a trick to prevent damage or the likes. That's what I first thought about Tactics when the game was announced, not just fighting, but dealing with several types of obstacles (and the core set rule-book supports that idea in the Tactics description)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85681-black-riders-spoiler%E2%80%A6-sorta/?do=findComment&comment=807405","commentId":807405,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1372652568,"content":"For what I can see (not particularly well) it should be 3, 1, 1, 2 (threat seems 5) and I think he's spirit.
