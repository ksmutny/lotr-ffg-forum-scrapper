In reality, nothing else should have been expected - this is a \"saga\" expansion that is meant to recreate the feel of the book; i.e. it's purpose is to allow us to play the story line of the book. frankly, you could argue beorn shouldn't even be a hero, as he's a minor portion of the novel. but, since we've obviously can't have 13 dwarf heroes, they are trying to branch out a bit; i don't think that's a disappointment, i think that's a great thing!\n\nI'm sure the second box will give us a hero from Lake town, maybe the lord of the eagles, wood-elves, etc…but given that 13 of 15 main characters in the book are a dwarf…lol. I just don't get any surprise/disappointment by anyone that the bulk of the cards would be dwarven. It might have been smarter to not do a dwarven cycle followed by the Hobbit, but, it's what FFG did.\n\nafter that, since we've been to Moria and now the Hobbit, I doubt we can expect many more dwarf heroes in the future."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69120-the-hobbit-expansion-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=674044","commentId":674044,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1344998615,"content":"Nori + Spirit Bofur = At a cost of 1, your threat at the same level from turn to turn.
