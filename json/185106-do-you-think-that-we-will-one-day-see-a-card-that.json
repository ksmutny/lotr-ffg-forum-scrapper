Forced effects vary a huge bunch, I can only assume that we will see cancelments of some stuff that can happen.

This would circumvent the core mechanic of many scenarios. The only way to make such an effect without breaking the game would be to give it multiple limitations (e.g. non-unique, non-quest cards, etc.)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185106-do-you-think-that-we-will-one-day-see-a-card-that/?do=findComment&comment=1736334","commentId":1736334,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1439575222,"content":"> I'd be much more excited to see a surge cancellation card.
