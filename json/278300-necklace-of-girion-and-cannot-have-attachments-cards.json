What happens if I play Necklace of Girion [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Wilds-of-Rhovanion/Necklace-of-Girion.jpg] and it finds a Goblin Troop [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Wilds-of-Rhovanion/Goblin-Troop.jpg] for its guarded effect? Is there a distinction between a card being an attachment vs being attached? Granted Necklace of Girion is also an \"attachment\" card, but it is not being attached in a conventional way. I feel like the intent is that the necklace attaches to the goblins, but I am not sure. The word \"Cannot\" is always supposed to be absolute. Have I missed a clarification in the Guarded keyword player card rules?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278300-necklace-of-girion-and-cannot-have-attachments-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3384790","commentId":3384790,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1529951375,"content":"Hmm.

That makes this card really good for certain quests that have nasty enemies that can't have player attachments like Ships, Mumak, Nazgul, Huorns etc. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278300-necklace-of-girion-and-cannot-have-attachments-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3386058","commentId":3386058,"userName":"icabod","timestamp":1530046446,"content":"Huh, shows what I know.\n\nI guess the word \"attach\" works both ways, in that case, as the Guarded keyword states that you attach the card from the encounter deck to the objective.  But looking at the card, it's not an objective, so I don't quite get how that fits in."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278300-necklace-of-girion-and-cannot-have-attachments-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3386463","commentId":3386463,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1530078824,"content":"The description of Guarded (X) in the Wilds of Rhovanion rules is quite clear that Guarded (X) cards are attached to the guard.
