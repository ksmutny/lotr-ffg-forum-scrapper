You don't combine the encounter sets is that's what you're wondering. What I have done is I have made up permanent encounter decks for the different quests, ( I have bought extra encounter sets separately) so I don't have to assemble the encounter deck every time I want to play. I just choose a quest and pull its encounter deck out of the box :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55519-3-or-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=549504","commentId":549504,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1320032848,"content":"LukeZZ said:\n\n What do you use of the second boxed set for a game with 3 or 4 players?\n\n\n\nNothing - since I don't have a second box. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\nI've not felt like I'm missing anything important, particularly in three player games (I've yet to play a four player game, but don't expect it to change my opinion)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55519-3-or-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=550186","commentId":550186,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1320146222,"content":"jhaelen said:\n\nLukeZZ said:\n\n \n\n What do you use of the second boxed set for a game with 3 or 4 players?\n\n \n\nNothing - since I don't have a second box. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\n \n\nI've not felt like I'm missing anything important, particularly in three player games (I've yet to play a four player game, but don't expect it to change my opinion).\n\n\n\nI've played a number of three and four player games using just a single core set."}]}
