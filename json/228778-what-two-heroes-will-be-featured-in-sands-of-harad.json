Legolas's ability is a fair bit better than Gimli's to me because all you have to do is discard a card which for many decks can be beneficial instead of a cost (Elven Light, Galdor ally AND hero, Lords of the Eldar, Glorfindel, Decks trying to empty their actual deck to allow for infinite recursion of a single card: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228800-how-to-infinitely-recur-any-event-in-the-game/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228800-how-to-infinitely-recur-any-event-in-the-game/]etc etc) whereas using a resource to trigger Gimli's ability is always a \"cost\" as there are not really any \"triggers\" or effects that occur when you spend resources.\n\n \n\nI also really like the Dwarven Shield and think that it is an amazing card for dwarves in general not just Gimli whereas the Long Knife is very meh. Silvan hero only means its only good on Legolas, Haldir and Argalad, Celeborn sort of, and its only good on Haldir with readying (And pales in comparison to the  to alternatives you could put on him). We have so few Silvan heroes to begin with that I wish  this could be attached to Silvan characters as well or alternatively Noldor heroes as well. Silvan and hero is just so restrictive and lately so many cards (ESPECIALLY elven ones) are so much more inclusive (Dunedain OR Ranger on Steed of the North, character on War Rainment, Ranger OR Scout on many new cards) that this is somewhat disappointing.\n\nEdited August 30, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228778-what-two-heroes-will-be-featured-in-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2391377","commentId":2391377,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1472548723,"content":"> Thinking in solo, these two with Leadership Aragorn might be good.

For instance, let's say you're running Elrond, Treebeard, and SpLegolas, and it's the early game. What you'd really like is to get double-duty out of either Elrond (so he can defend something) or Treebeard (so you can use his Willpower-boosting ability if needed but still have him ready to smash something). At this point in the game, you don't really need Legolas' 3 atk--you'd much rather use one of the other heroes a second time--so it's kinda like getting two copies of a high-threat hero for 9 threat (and a card discard). Then later in the game when you've got your LoV and Unexpected Courages down, you can just use Legolas for his 3 atk. He's flexible that way.\n\n \n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> > Mirkwood Knife is good on most of the silvan heroes, if they have Light of Valinor as well.  Too bad the Noldor usually hog that attachment (though to be fair, LoV really *should* be on a Noldor thematically.)\n> \n> If we're being picky, LoV should only work for Glorfindel and Galadriel (and it'd be useless on Galadriel). No-one else in the game has been to Valinor. Well, the wizards as well. Point is putting it on Silvan heroes is about as thematic as putting it on most of the Noldor heroes (which is to say, it's not).\n\nKinda makes me wish it said \"Attach to a Noldor or Istari character\" now. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228778-what-two-heroes-will-be-featured-in-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2398864","commentId":2398864,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1472977360,"content":"> Let us praise the gods it's not, for a second.\n\n \n\nIt's a card that shouldn't exist, really.

especially since the Warden came along.  \n\n \n\nI'm not a crazy advocate of errata, but just for the sake of discussion, I think Splorfindel would benefit from a simple update:  Any time he is committed to a quest, raise your threat by 1 (eliminate the exhaust requirement).  LoV would still be an amazing card and useful for him, but Splorfindel would no longer be able to escape his high profile - a point which is specifically thematic.\n\n \n\nA good question for everyone here is:  Can you think of a new event or attachment which could specifically give Lorefindel a bump and make him more competitive with his spirit counterpart?\n\n \n\nPerhaps an event:  Until the end of the phase, after you trigger a card effect that heals any amount of damage, draw 1 card.  \n\n \n\nThis is off the top of my head, feel free to poke holes in it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228778-what-two-heroes-will-be-featured-in-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2403423","commentId":2403423,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1473249803,"content":"Some of my old takes on dealing with the Glorfindels:\n\n \n\njQJ8tYz8Ep0.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c637517/v637517009/15fe9/jQJ8tYz8Ep0.jpg]\n\n \n\n4GnE_Xtqkg8.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c637517/v637517009/15ff1/4GnE_Xtqkg8.jpg]\n\nEdited September 7, 2016 by John Constantine"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228778-what-two-heroes-will-be-featured-in-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2403437","commentId":2403437,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1473250539,"content":"The Lore version will never see widespread play with that godawful art."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228778-what-two-heroes-will-be-featured-in-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2403473","commentId":2403473,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1473252302,"content":"> The Lore version will never see widespread play with that godawful art.\n\n \n\nWhile I can objectively critique the quality of art, especially in a comparative context, please try to remember you're talking about the hard work and effort of real people.  As one coming from an artistic background, the art choice on this card is far from awful and calling it such is demeaning to the artist, however you rank it among the current pool of card art.  \n\n \n\nI implore everyone to please keep this discourse civil and impersonal in its criticisms.  Thank you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228778-what-two-heroes-will-be-featured-in-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2403691","commentId":2403691,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1473260051,"content":"It looks like the artist has never drawn a human being from life before."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228778-what-two-heroes-will-be-featured-in-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2403693","commentId":2403693,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1473260147,"content":"> It looks like the artist has never drawn a human being from life before.\n\nWell, Glorfindel is an elf :3"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228778-what-two-heroes-will-be-featured-in-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=2404098","commentId":2404098,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1473273507,"content":"> I'm not a crazy advocate of errata, but just for the sake of discussion, I think Splorfindel would benefit from a simple update:  Any time he is committed to a quest, raise your threat by 1 (eliminate the exhaust requirement).  LoV would still be an amazing card and useful for him, but Splorfindel would no longer be able to escape his high profile -
