We have three neutral already and unless they plan on going two per pack on the last two, it would seem a little weird to only make it halfway through the spheres a second time. I don't think they would burn the last two neutral cards on master cards since they have so many already, but to take away four of the remaining 18 non hero player cards and devote them to master seems pretty expensive as well. Thoughts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305204-master-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3883291","commentId":3883291,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1580478278,"content":"I guess, they will be handled similar to player side quests: the deluxe contains the neutral card(s), and the first four AP one of each sphere.

You can start with him in play for no cost and he could have some awesome effect like an extra card/resource/location-based trickery but also potentially turn on you if conditions change (either treachery cards or more likely something like when you lose a hero or if this character takes damage equal to its hitpoints, flip this card). "}]}
