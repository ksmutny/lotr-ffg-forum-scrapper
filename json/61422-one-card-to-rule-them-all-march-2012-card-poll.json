Also I am assuming you mean player cards.. not Heroes.\n\nSome notes on my choices, I diced that conditional cards might not be a god option (feel free to nominate conditional cards yourself) Like say Support of the Eagles for tactics but this card is 100% useless with out an eagle card getting drawn and cast. I thought it might be best to pick cards that are powerful in their own right as soon as you draw them with out any need for supprt fomr other player cards\n\nLeadership\n\n * Steward of Gondor (I think this is a given)\n\nSpirit\n\n * Ziggy (Hard choice Tracker, Test and UC defiantly are up for the most powerful in entire game as well.)\n\nLore\n\n * Rivendale Minstrel (This is really hard choice, lore has so many good ones, Still 3 for 2(w) plus a fetch spell for mana fixing? Pretty darn strong)\n\nTactics\n\n * Feint.\n\nMost Powerful Playercard\n\n * Ziggy.\n\nMost Thematic Card\n\n * These Dunedain Mark - The story of the Dunedain and is very cool, and one of the more interesting back stories that I know of. People coming from the films as their only source might think that Aragon was the only \"ranger\" but in fact he was only from a single set, the Northern Dunedain. The Arnor and Gondor were also Dunedain and all communicated between each other by a secret series of symbols and marks left though out the word. These acted as a relay of information between Rangers and ever to the other Dunedain factions. I find it quite satisfying that such a small and obscure point as this secret communication, with was also instrumental in the organisation of resistance to Mordor in the War of the Ring is encapsulated in this card as a increase to attack. These marks were basically communication between rangers about teh locations, strength and make up of various enemies you could encounter, allowing the new comers to better defend or attack.. pretty mcuh exactly what the card dose in the game\n\n\nNastiest Encounter Card\n\n * Festering Wounds - Crazy hard choice. I want to say the new khaz troll, and necromancers pass got a think as it is common, but I think of all the cards ever, this is the one that has lost me the game most often though a wipe of the entire board.\n\nBest Artwork (either Player or Encounter Card)\n\n * Dawn Take You All - This question is just insane.. make it a top 10 at least.. so many good cards... but I think this card is defiantly one of my favs. I think the art is fantastic and I love the glow of the destination. The art matches the theme of the card so well and for those that have toiled in Return to Mirkwood can really appreciate the beauty of the forest road final clearing into a bright open pasture, and the na nice pony ride to the inn. There are many great cards but for me this on I can literally feel the peace and relief that the artist is trying to portray.. not only form the art but teh pack it was packaged ion as well as the effect of teh card itself. Just fantastic and a prime example of why, even with all this games faults, it is still such a beautify crafted game that it tears the eye.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=602151","commentId":602151,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1330917509,"content":"yes i did this a few months back, didnt really kick  off though..............(prepare for another forum software fail....)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Most Powerful Player Card - Leadership Sphere\n\nsteward of gondor- an extra 2 resources per turn is useful in so many way, and in so many combos\n\n2. Most Powerful Player Card - Spirit Sphere\n\nunexepected courage-again this can be used in any strategy to a huge advantage\n\n3. Most Powerful Player Card - Lore Sphere\n\nprotector of lorien- i love the unlimited willpower buff you get from this,and with a big card draw you can fly through quests\n\n4. Most Powerful Player Card - Tactics Sphere\n\neagles of the misty mountains- in an eagle deck these can become so powerful, especially when discarding the 1 cost eagle allies after you have played them\n\n5. Most Powerful Player Card - All Spheres (excluding Gandalf)\n\nunexpected courage- as a solo player there really isnt  better card than unexpected courage, it opens up so many options\n\n6.

Quick and cheap access to any ally including Gandalf without losing access to the ally later is quite potent.\n\nBest Spirit\n\nUnexpected Courage. Increasing the amount of Hero actions every turn by a third is an amazing opportunity.  With enough luck with draws, you could end up doubling Hero actions.\n\nBest Tactics\n\nFeint. For the same reason as Forest Snare, it isn't as long lasting, but its far more affordable.\n\nThematic\n\nProbably the multi-functional uses of Gandlaf paired with his moving along at the end of the round.  Represents well his role throughout the texts, whether it be removal of obstacles, elimination of specific foes, or mustering resources.\n\nArt\n\nFor me its Bifur, but I just love that Hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=603058","commentId":603058,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1331094704,"content":"We mr, we got three out of four spheres just the same, the only one missing being Lore where I got Gildor Inglorion who you have as an avatar.

Much needed respite when you're overwhelmed, or when you really need to kill a strong enemy and use everything you got (saaaay like a Nazgul).\n\nMost Powerful : Lore\n\n-Gleowine.

I almost said Protector of Lorien, as that was my first impulse, but then I realized that the Protector of Lorien is only so good as my card draw, and no single card supplies as many cards as Beravor.\n\nSpirit\n\nA Test of Will. Unexpected Courage is great, especially with Beravor, and the Zigil Miner has prompted the rise of an entirely new deck archetype. In fact, Spirit is loaded with great cards, including Dwarven Tomb, Northern Tracker, and Stand and Fight. However, while the other cards allow you to do things a bit better than other cards can do them, A Test of Will is the *only* card currently in the game that can cancel the worst effects the encounter deck can throw at you.\n\nTactics\n\nWell, this is the sphere most often left out of my decks, sadly. It's an especially sad fact, given how much I like the concept. Both the heroes Boromir and Legolas deserve consideration in this sphere, and as people have pointed out, Feint is also very strong. However, Feint only deals with an enemy for a single round; it doesn't defeat the enemy. Quick Strike is better in that regard, especially with a souped-up Gimli, who also deserves consideration. In the end, though, I'd have to say the strongest card in this sphere is the Horn of Gondor. Especially in multi-player, this card can generate a good deal of resources, and for all those arguing how the Steward of Gondor is the strongest Leadership card, the Horn sees play less frequently and is, thus, less likely to be redundant in a game.\n\nLeadership\n\nSneak Attack. Steward of Gondor is right up there, too, but Sneak Attack + Gandalf is the best combo in the game, by far. The versatility this card affords is tremendous, as is the ability to bring allies into play out of the normal turn sequence.\n\nMost Thematic\n\nI like Frodo, here. The ability to deflect damage could be either the mithral shirt or the One Ring, and the conversion to threat is just perfect.\n\nBest Artwork\n\nI look at my heroes more than any other cards, so I'd have to vote for one of them. I'm a big fan of Magali's work, too, so I think I'd have to go with Legolas. It's not an easy choice, though, as there are so many great art pieces."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=603648","commentId":603648,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1331209634,"content":"Thorongil, I like your take.

I like this thread very much. Different perspectives.\n\nHorn of Gondor. What a great multiplayer card. It is interesting that Steward is getting all the love (obviously) but Horn almost none. I know people here often play solo and then you would really need some autodestructive deck (and get it early) for it to really bear fruit, Rohan plus Eagles perhaps. But I have been recently playing four-player games. There it really shines. One of the games (lasted 5 rounds, 4 completed) I counted how much money it made. We played it one turn one and 11 allies have left play (some due Sneak Attack). If you subtract the cost, it made 10 resources. Steward was also played on turn one (and it is harder to achieve) and it made a total of 8 resources (after you subtracted the cost).\n\nLongbeard Map-maker. I really like that one in my Zi-Gildor deck. I often use a copy or two (if I can get it) to feed Zigil and the one for questing. It is great thematicaly that Lore can deal with questing this way, and with new quests it seems more and more important to quest \"just right\", being successful is not always helpful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=603837","commentId":603837,"userName":"RGun","timestamp":1331254645,"content":"Below are my picks for the first 5 questions.  I need some more time to look through all the encounter cards for the last 3.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Most Powerful Player Card - Spirit Sphere\nThe Galadhrim's Greeting. There are several powerful cards in this sphere (e.g. Unexpected Courage, Northern Tracker) but the ability to quickly reduce my threat by 6 has gotten me out of many a jam and often made the difference between victory and defeat.\n\n\n3. Most Powerful Player Card - Lore Sphere\nProtector of Lorien. With a deck built to draw cards quickly this card can let you blast through the last couple of phases of a quest in no time at all.\n\n\n4. Most Powerful Player Card - Tactics Sphere\nCitadel Plate. I had a tough time with this one as I rarely play a Tactics sphere and I suspect there are much better than my selection, especially given it's high cost of 4.

Most Powerful - Leadership: Rear Guard - especially in single player. I mean for the price of 1 resource, 1 card from hand, and a discarded ally in play you can easily get 2 or even 3 additional willpower for questing! Ok so seriously . . . Sneak Attack or Steward of Gondor are probably the card, but I give a HEAVY honorable mention to Timely Aid which I think is more universally useful than Sneak Attack and doesn't have uniqueness limitations of Steward.\n\n2. Most Powerful - Spirit: Northern Tracker - I can't believe this hasn't been posted as a winner yet. I would argue it is the most game changing card you can put in play - and by game changing I mean after you play it, you are playing a significantly different and much easier game. Unexpected courage is cool and all, but outside of a very short list of heroes (Beravor, Denathor, Eleanor and possibly Gimli) or crazy attachment stacks, it is roughly matched by playing a powerful ally. Test of will - one time only, not game changing. Zigil Miner is awesome as well and probably is the best card IF you build your deck around him - although one of the key reasons my Ziggy deck kicks so much asphalt is because it makes it easier to buy a certain Dunedain. Northern Tracker fits in any deck and dominates.\n\n3. Most Powerful - Lore: Daughter of the Nimrodel - Probably not a sexy pick, but Lore isn't particularly top heavy in overpowered cards. I MISS having a Daughter available in games and is one of the primary reasons I am looking to buy another core set so that they can be sprinkled in more of the decks I maintain. It keeps heroes alive and synergizes with Gloin for a resource machine that can match Steward plus you can have multiple in play to stack the fun.\n\n4. Most Powerful - Tactics: Landroval - Eagles rock. It is almost unfair to call one out. But this guy attacks at 3, is a good defender, is sentinel, AND it operates as a Fortune or Fate. The only problem is the expense. Winged Guardian would be my second choice as the ability to get out a 4 defense Sentinel cheaply is incredible.\n\n5. Most Powerful - All Spheres: Northern Tracker - I am guessing that people hyped themselves out on this card a year ago. Sure the recent quests have been more beefy in their number of quest tokens required which mitigates its power. But keep in mind all of those games that you've lost because you got behind on questing and locations. If you can't overquest the staging area, you can't get past the current location, which means you can't clear any locations and they just pile up getting worse and worse. Now think back to those games, I would bet you didn't have an NT in play. Why? Because that doesn't happen with NTs where you are always just a few turns from auto-killing locations. AND it is one of the better all around combat allies in the game as well. Those that can defend better - Gandalf, Gildor, Beorn, Eagles of the Misty Mountains. Those that can attack better - Gandalf, Beorn, Veteran of Nanduhirion, Landroval, Vassal of the Windlord\n\n6. Most Thematic Card: Keeping Count - very cool . . . but so useless unless I go buy 3-6 more.\n\n7. Nastiest Encounter Card: Sudden Pitfall - the king of suck, blow, and unfairness.

I agree about Northern Tracker being one of the most powerful cards in the game but with the expansions there are quests in which he is not THAT useful, he is always useful but he completely steals the ones like Dol Guldur (nasty locations that need 1 or 2 tokens only). I, for instance, really like playing the Carrock and there I often leave the Tracker sit even though I get him because I just need not quest that heavy or get rid of numerous locations. Thus I would still argue Courage is generally more powerful Spirit card although I like Tracker better from the point of theme and art.\n\nAs for the Eagles, I like Vassal the best, especially in combo with the Support. But the Guardian is just as great, probably depends what the deck (or scenario) needs more."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=604697","commentId":604697,"userName":"ragnarhedin","timestamp":1331548519,"content":"Best Overall Card for Questing/Escape Tests:\n\nUnexpected Courage is very strong by itself for obvious reasons, but I also like Dunedain Quest or Favor of the Lady to boost characters not usually seen questing.  For Escape tests, this allows for much greater flexibility in overall strategy and hedges bets against losing main questers to treachery cards.\n\nAlong with that I would also list Dain. For my builds his main purpose is all of the ancillary quest he brings through dwarves in play. Again he benefits questing, but is has far more impact for escape tests.\n\nBest Overall Card for Defense:\n\nAllies: Winged Guardian, Gondorian Spearman, or Erebor Hammersmith (cost 2 for 1 Def and 3 HP)\n\nAttachment: Burning Brand - in a game where threat is built on unpredictablility, any sure thing is positive\n\nBest Overall Card for Attack:\n\nCompletely situational so I'll say Gandalf because 4 automatic damage to any enemy in play is too potent to ignore\n\nBest Overall Card for Shadows:\n\nDunedain Watcher - a fairly solid character for the cost without her special, but the special puts her over the top.\n\nBest Overall Card for Hero Support(Could be Healing or Resources):\n\nThe songs for multi sphere decks otherwise maybe citadel plate\n\nBest Overall Card for Resources:\n\nOn its own Steward of Gondor, for dwarf decks its Narvi's belt."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=604930","commentId":604930,"userName":"Beano","timestamp":1331581285,"content":"Beano said:\n\n7.
