It may then be useful, to combo with something like that. Then again, Secret Paths and Radagast's Cunning do a much better job, although they are not permanent.\n\nAs for Brok Ironfist, I played him just like that a couple of days ago. I lost Gloin, so I put Brok in play. He's really pretty good, just expensive.

PitE hard counters Old Forest Road, Banks of the Anduin and the Endless Caverns. A card that acts as a silver bullet to some Encounter cards can't be completely useless imho.\n\n \n\n2. PtiE essentially gives you +1 Willpower for a certain while. There is only one other card with +1 Willpower for a cost of one, that is Henamarth (and I haven't used him to quest anytime). So 1 Willpower for a cost of one is pretty nice.\n\n \n\n3. Its low cost makes it a good choice for mulit-sphere decks, where you can't afford to lose the early quest phases (eg for fear of hitting 30 threat and a Hill Troll). Handling the first -lets say- three turns is probably the most important step in winning the game.\n\n \n\n4. Consider putting it on cards like the Enchanted Stream, where you usually don't want to travel to. Now with a threat strength of 1, I often leave the Stream in the staging area (which nets me a card so to speak, since traveling to the Stream very often prevents you from drawing one card and hopefully none more).\n\n \n\n5. This is a funny one: PitE acts as a lifeguard for your better attachments! There are many Shadow cards out there, that cost you an attachment and playing Hasty Stroke to counter those is often what I'll do, especially if I'd have to discard Steward of Gondor or Unexpected Courage. Now discard PitE instead! Comparing the net gain with Hasty Stroke: you have spent one resource in both cases, you have invested one card in both cases to get \"rid\" of that shadow effect. While Hasty Stroke can also be used against other shadow cards, PitE has netted you some more progress or less threat. And considering that you play both PitE and Hasty Stroke, you can now safe you Stroke for when the Hummerhorns or the Spawn come out as the shadow effect.\n\n \n\n6. Comparing it with the Favor of the Lady also is not too bad: Both cards net you one extra Willpower and if you play PitE on those 1 threat locations, then it is just cheaper. If you do a move like that under number 4, then it also is just cheaper. If it goes away after a couple of turns, then FotL would have been better, but you still got something at a reasonable cost.\n\n \n\nHope this helps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47802-power-in-the-earth/?do=findComment&comment=480092","commentId":480092,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1307188681,"content":"plueschi said:\n\nservant of the secret fire said:\n\n \n\nplueschi said:\n\n \n\n Just out of curiosity: Do you like Hasty Stroke of Favor of the Lady?\n\n \n\n \n\nYeap, i use them both.Especialy hasty stroke has saved my heroes countless times.\n\nAs for the Favor of the Lady except that it is my favorite card(art wise) in the core set with 2 on Eowyn many times i only quest with Eowyn so i have more characters to defend/attack.\n\n \n\n \n\nSince you answered yes, I may have some food for thought for you:\n\n \n\nI think Power in the Earth is a pretty valid card and can compare to the other two in strength.\n\n \n\n1.

You are right that PitE obviously is not useful if there are no locations around, but you really don't have to wait long, now do you?\n\n \n\nThe point of Northern Trackers highlights one of the uses of PotE: If you are playing deck that is short on Sphere resources, the Tracker might not be a good choice to put in your deck in the first place.\n\n \n\nAnd regarding your question about whether or not I would put PotE in my deck instead of one of the others? Yes, I would. Sort of. I would rather play 2 PotE, \" FotL and 2 Hasty Stroke, than play 3 Hasty Stroke and 3 FotL in my current situation. That way you are more flexible I think.\n\n \n\nMaybe I can phrase my point differently: The effect of FotL is superior to PotE, but thats why it costs double, right? And considering the relative strength, I do like PotE. \n\nIn my view PotE is worth it, if it sticks around for three turns. Thats three more progress/less threat for one resource. A fair deal I think. Of course FotL sticks around \"forever\", but \"forever\" is just until the end of the game (which takes about 6 turns to finish in my experience).\n\n \n\nHope this makes sense.
