The rules say that a response triggers immediatly after the event it is responding to occurs. Core set rules page 23, like I mentioned. That is why they are called responses.

Caleb's new ruling says that between a trigger and its solution there is no time between. So even if you resolve Thalin's effect first, we should still have to reveal the surge effect from Eastern Crows. Because it is triggered immediatly after the Crows are revealed from the encounter deck. But if responses work that why, surge effects should also be queued until every other effect resolves.\n\n \n\nTo give another bizarre example:\n\n \n\nSay there is a treachery that tells you: \"When revealed: \"Draw one card and resolve its effect.\" You draw a card and it is a \"A Test of Will\". So according to the new rules, as no time has passed at all,  you use it to cancel the treachery's effect. But if you cancel the when revealed effect you cannot draw a card. So you never got \"A Test of Will\" which means you have to trigger the when revealed effect.

In the FAQ the player decides the order in which these simultaneus effects occur.

Do you mean a treachery card instructs you to draw one of your own cards to resolve? In any regard, once you have started resolving an effect, you resolve it fully before you move on to other things.

However, I had some thoughts about it: the Responses here are optional. So if there is a loop, it is only a matter of choice. Breaking the loop is just deciding not to do it (and play \"A Test of Will\" all over again). The only infinite loop problem would arise only if they both had a Forced effect.\n\n \n\nNow such kind of games have infinite loops sometimes that break the game. And it happend in the past with LOTR:\n\n * \n   : that one is a voluntary one that gave infinite resources. It is a voluntary one, and was fixed by errata'ing Beravor.\n * Thalin passive effect also was errata'ed because - in part - of an infinite loop with the Surge effect on the Eastern Crows. So making the Thalin effect prior to Surge solved the issue. A lot of players from MTG were puzzled, because of the stack system. In LOTR, there is no stack, and effects are queued instead, with priorities.\n\nIf what you say is an infinite loop, it can be fixed at two levels:\n\n * Simply by errata'ing the cards responsible for it. It is a straightforward and easy way, but indeed not a global solution\n * Changing or rather precising the rules about timings to prevent loops. This is probably the best solution, although it may be difficult to anticipate all situations and cards, especially those that bend rules with the Golden Rule.\n\nRegarding Caleb, do not forget he is not the only one to decide on rules. He has a team with him that playtest a lot, and he has already reverted rules in the past (e.g. attaching cards to Locations that cannot be targets of player effects).\n\n \n\nI really think that what we need is a refined turn sequence, which would help squash these interpretations, especially at trigger points."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89609-after-you-travel-trigger-timing-query/?do=findComment&comment=857411","commentId":857411,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1378290205,"content":"> And I'm not surprised, too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] It is consistent with other LCG such as CoC.  Nice to know the official ruling, thanks Zeb!\n\nSorry Angus, I should have mentioned you too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89609-after-you-travel-trigger-timing-query/?do=findComment&comment=857504","commentId":857504,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1378303515,"content":">  \n> \n> > And I'm not surprised, too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] It is consistent with other LCG such as CoC.  Nice to know the official ruling, thanks Zeb!\n> \n> Sorry Angus, I should have mentioned you too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n> \n>  \n\nNo need to feel sorry. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89609-after-you-travel-trigger-timing-query/?do=findComment&comment=857721","commentId":857721,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1378319429,"content":">  \n> \n>  \n> \n> I really think that what we need is a refined turn sequence, which would help squash these interpretations, especially at trigger points.\n> \n>  \n\nI can only support this.

An ally of mine leaves play.\nCan i play both V.S.? Also the correct order is. Play the first one, i draw 2 cards and then play the second one.\n\nSituation 2\nI have 1 Valiant Sacrifice card in my hand. An ally of mine leaves play. I play the Valiant Sacrifice and one of the 2 cards is a new Valiant Sacrifice. Can i play the recently received Valiant Sacrifice immediately?\n\n \n\nNate French:\n\n \n\nResponse effects are resolved completely before the next response is\nplayed.\n\nSituation 1\n\nPlay and resolve the first copy. (Draw 2 cards)\n\nPlay and resolve the second copy. (Draw 2 more cards)\n\nSituation 2\n\nYes, you can play the copy you just drew. \"You could play the second one. All responses are played and resolved before moving on to the next response, so the response opportunity remains open until all players have passed the opportunity to respond.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89609-after-you-travel-trigger-timing-query/?do=findComment&comment=859640","commentId":859640,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1378497188,"content":"This is still silly. There is no other response. You only get the new response from the second Valiant Sacrifice as a result of another response. The other point is simply a PoV of how evebts proceeds - for me I have the following picture in mind:\n\n \n\nSay someone asks: \"Who wants to have a pie?\" Several people raise their hands.
