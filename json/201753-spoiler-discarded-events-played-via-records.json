If 1x Skyward Volley is in your discard pile, and you play it via the Book of Eldacar, do you:\n\n- Resolve the main effect twice because you do have a copy of Skyward Volley in the discard pile (itself), or\n\n- Resolve it only once because that copy is considered to be in your hand and NOT the discard pile anymore...?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201753-spoiler-discarded-events-played-via-records/?do=findComment&comment=2038209","commentId":2038209,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1454866434,"content":"We discussed it with Elwing's Flight and Map of Earnil in this thread: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/]\n\nDon't think we got an entirely definite conclusion though.

I think it's awesome Mr. Newman is showing up on the CotR Discord channel.\n\n \n\n \n\nEDIT: And just to make it even more official...\n\n \n\n \n\n> When you play an event from your discard pile with Map of Earnil, the event leaves your discard pile and resolves its effect, then you place it back in the discard pile. So, if there are 2 copies of Elwing’s Flight when you choose to play one with Map of Earnil, there will only be 1 in the discard pile when you resolve its effect.\n\nEdited February 8, 2016 by sappidus"}]}
