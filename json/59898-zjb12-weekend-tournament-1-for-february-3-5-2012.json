I wanted to play Aragorn along with the Spirit Hero because of the potential of Celebrian's Stone.\n\nIt didn't work too well for the second deck. Too much starting threat and it just goes up crazy fast with Boromir fighting non-stop. My next intention was to use a Boromir / Eowyn deck along with a Glorfindel / Dain Ironfoot one. Combining Lore with Leadership will let me play Steward of Gondor on the Lore Hero. Lore has the most expensive cards (3 and plus) that I intend to play from the 4 Spheres. With Dain, I'll be able to play many dwarven allies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59898-zjb12-weekend-tournament-1-for-february-3-5-2012/?do=findComment&comment=589662","commentId":589662,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1328310383,"content":" I tried earlier this week and failed.  I made my two decks today and came really close with a Eowyn/Aragorn deck, but just kept coming up short and always drawing the path with the spawn.  My other deck is glorfindel/Gimli.  Nt sure how that will do yet.  I went 1-4 on the other quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59898-zjb12-weekend-tournament-1-for-february-3-5-2012/?do=findComment&comment=589724","commentId":589724,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1328334292,"content":"Just finished (what else is there to do at 6 am when you're waiting to know if the roof is gonna fall on your head, besides playing LotR).\n\nResult:\n\nWin (Don't leave the path): 33 threat + 0 dead hero + 5 wounds - 0 victory points + (10 rounds * 10) = 138\n\nWin (Don't leave the path): 34 threat + 0 dead hero + 0 wound - 0 victory points + (7 rounds * 10) = 104\n\nCombined score: 242\n\nDecklists (in the order played)\n\nTactics / Spirit\n\nHero (2)\nBoromir (TDM) x1\nEowyn (Core) x1\n\nAlly (20)\nEscort from Edoras (AJtR) x2\nGandalf (Core) x3\nGondorian Spearman (Core) x3\nNorthern Tracker (Core) x2\nThe Riddermark's Finest (THoEM) x2\nVassal of the Windlord (TDM) x3\nWandering Took (Core) x2\nWest Road Traveller (RtM) x3\n\nAttachment (11)\nAncient Mathom (AJtR) x3\nBlade of Gondolin (Core) x2\nHorn of Gondor (Core) x2\nSong of Travel (THoEM) x2\nUnexpected Courage (Core) x2\n\nEvent (19)\nA Test of Will (Core) x3\nBlade Mastery (Core) x3\nDwarven Tomb (Core) x2\nFeint (Core) x3\nHasty Stroke (Core) x3\nStand and Fight (Core) x2\nThe Galadhrim's Greeting (Core) x3\n\nLeadership / Lore\n\nHero (2)\nDain Ironfoot (RtM) x1\nGlorfindel (Core) x1\n\nAlly (24)\nDaughter of the Nimrodel (Core) x1\nErebor Hammersmith (Core) x3\nGandalf (Core) x3\nGildor Inglorion (THoEM) x1\nGleowine (Core) x2\nHaldir of Lorien (AJtR) x2\nHenamarth Riversong (Core) x2\nLongbeard Map-Maker (CatC) x3\nMiner of the Iron Hills (Core) x2\nRivendell Minstrel (THFG) x2\nSnowbourn Scout (Core) x3\n\nAttachment (14)\nCelebrian's Stone (Core) x2\nForest Snare (Core) x3\nProtector of Lorien (Core) x3\nSelf Preservation (Core) x2\nSong of Kings (THFG) x1\nSteward of Gondor (Core) x3\n\nEvent (12)\nEver Vigilant (Core) x3\nRumour from the Earth (RtM) x2\nSneak Attack (Core) x3\nStrider's Path (THFG) x3\nValiant Sacrifice (Core) x1\n\nSummary and comments:\n\nIt went pretty much the way I expected it. The first game saw a few more locations than enemies, but I won't complain. I quested with both heroes on turn 1, readying Boromir from the Old Forest Road and engaging the Forest Spider. Allies started coming out after the second round on a steady basis. I held on to 2 Gandalf until the end, but only managed to play one to help me finish Ungoliant's Spawn. Horn of Gondor was well supplemented with allies sacrificing themselves (Vassal of the Windlords in an attack to kill a Dol Guldur Beastmaster, The Riddermark's Finest to eliminate a Necromancer's Pass from the staging area) left and right. I got my three Ancient Mathom in a row (well, the second and third were drawn off the previous one) and kept hitting locations, so I wasn't worried. Ended up with an unused A Test of Will as well.\n\nThe second game was even better. I had a hand with Steward of Gondor and 5 Lore cards. Glorfindel quested all game long and brought his army of dwarves out of the woods while Dain stood guard, making everyone else a little better. Self Preservation even ensured I could let a few attacks slip through without worries. I flipped to stage 3 just after having revealed Ungoliant's Spawn as a shadow card; would probably have won a round earlier if it had been Beorn's Path (since I could have quested with everyone without worrying about fighting off the spider). I left Hummerhorns in the staging area at the end (they showed up on the turn after I cast Gandalf).\n\nA very nice challenge. As I said earlier, much harder than it may sound like. I think the key is in playing the best questing characters and playing a lot of low cost cards. I'll be curious to see the scores people obtain by using different heroes (if others do)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59898-zjb12-weekend-tournament-1-for-february-3-5-2012/?do=findComment&comment=589971","commentId":589971,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1328388413,"content":" Finally switched my Heros around and used the same pairings as sickboy.  Problem I seem to have is I can win with one duo and lose with the other, so it's not back to back.  When I lose it's as often because of too many locations as it is too many enemies.  If only they made a Southern Tracker and out him in Lore!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59898-zjb12-weekend-tournament-1-for-february-3-5-2012/?do=findComment&comment=590060","commentId":590060,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1328425603,"content":"Zjb12 said:\n\n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59898-zjb12-weekend-tournament-1-for-february-3-5-2012/?do=findComment&comment=590061","commentId":590061,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1328425668,"content":"muemakan said:\n\nZjb12 said:\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOO, all for nothing. \n\nI will submit my score anyway:\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGame 1: Beorn´s Path\n\n \n\nBoromir/Eowyn (R-5, W-3, TH-28, V-0) Total: 81 \n\nGandalf in round 5  was perfect for questing and reducing some threat.\n\n \n\nGame 2: Don´t leave the Path\n\n \n\nImrahil/Glorfindel (R-6,W-0,TH-37, V-0) Total: 97\n\nA SoG in my starting Hand, do I have to say more….?!\n\n \n\n \n\nOverall: 178\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59898-zjb12-weekend-tournament-1-for-february-3-5-2012/?do=findComment&comment=590068","commentId":590068,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1328427435,"content":"muemakan said:\n\nZjb12 said:\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nYou made me laugh first thing this morning!!!  Good job on your game too!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59898-zjb12-weekend-tournament-1-for-february-3-5-2012/?do=findComment&comment=590205","commentId":590205,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1328456255,"content":" Tried again, this time won with glorfindel and Dain but lost with Borodin and eowyn.  Cannot seem to get back to back wins on this!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59898-zjb12-weekend-tournament-1-for-february-3-5-2012/?do=findComment&comment=590241","commentId":590241,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1328467144,"content":" Alright, time is up....90+ minutes ago, but I was at a Super Bowl party.  Our finishers:\n\n1.  Muemakan 178 (eowyn, Boromir, 81);  (Imrahil, glorfindel, 97).\n\n2.  Sick-boy 242 (eowyn, boromir, 138); (Dain, glorfindel, 104).\n\n3.  Memetix 246 (eowyn, boronia, 94); (Glorfindel, Gloin, 152).\n\nEowyn, Boromir was the big pairing and then Glorfindel and leadership hero.  Good job you guys and kudos for pulling off back-to-back wins, something I couldn't do!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59898-zjb12-weekend-tournament-1-for-february-3-5-2012/?do=findComment&comment=590345","commentId":590345,"userName":"Memetix","timestamp":1328496103,"content":"Well done everyone - I was hoping to play lots yesterday, but spent the day in bed feeling pretty ill.\n\nI built some test decks last week using all AP's, not realising that we wouldn't be using Khazad Dum cards in the tournament.
