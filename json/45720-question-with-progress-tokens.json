I decide to travel to a location. Do I move the progress token to the location or do the progress tokens stay on that quest card? After watching the tutorial it just confuses me a little bit that they show the token removed from the Flies and Spiders quest and put it on the Old Forest Road. Thank you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45720-question-with-progress-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=458542","commentId":458542,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1303676466,"content":"Afaik, when you travel, all progress tokens earned so far stay on the quest.. Once the new location becomes active, any newly earned progress token go to the location until you have an amount equal to the locations quest value.
