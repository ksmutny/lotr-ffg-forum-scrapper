Lets say that the current quest has the Battle Keyword.\n\nI play Ravens of the Mountain event card. The revealed card is a Southron Company card.\n\nWould I add 1 or 3 progress tokens in the quest? \n\n \n\nI ask because the Southron Company gets +2 threat while the current quest card has the battle or siege keyword. But the Southron Company card is not in play while I am  revealing it with Ravens of the Mountain, so what about its passive ability? \n\n \n\nThe more general question is: Are passive abilities of encounter cards (that affect their stats:\n\nThreat, Attack, Defense and HitPoints) in effect while these cards are in the encounter deck?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94066-ravens-of-the-mountain-southron-company/?do=findComment&comment=916149","commentId":916149,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1385387346,"content":"I have been playing it so Southron Company does not get a bonus in this instance.\n\nWith the argument that the card is not used as it´s inherent type.\n\nDon´t know if this is how it is supposed to be handled though"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94066-ravens-of-the-mountain-southron-company/?do=findComment&comment=916164","commentId":916164,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1385389273,"content":"The card's text applies only if the card is in play or otherwise explicity noted.\n\nCards you are looking at are not considered in play because they are still considered in the encounter deck.\n\nAnd cards that are in the encounter deck are ruled to be out of play.

(with other card than ravens of the mountains, of course)\n\nYou have to be coherent and either treat X as 0 when the card is not in play, or find a solution for all cases. Just imagine a location that read \"turn the first card of the encounter face visible, X (the threat of this location) is the threat of this card\".
