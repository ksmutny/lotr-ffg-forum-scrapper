Even if the other 2 copies of each are in the other deck, this deck is weird. He maximizes allies and events, but only has 1 copy of each of those two cards? Silly. Also, those 2 cards are the only Lore cards in the deck. I know Elrond can pay for any ally, but he's also putting a burden on the other 2 heroes to pay for all the events and attachments. At least throw a Vilya or 2 in there so he'll have a Spirit icon to help with the Spirit attackments and events.\n\nConsidering the extreme lack of Lore cards in this deck, you have to assume that the other deck will feature Lore much more heavily, which means we'll definitely see Haldir, and potentially also see Mirlonde in there to make sure they can afford all the Lore cards. I also assume Legolas will be in there. It'll almost definitely be Legolas and Haldir, but it could potentially be Glorfindel instead of Mirlonde, but due to only having 2 Light of Valinor and so many Spirit cards in this deck, I assume he'll skip Glorfindel and Spirit altogether in the next deck.\n\nIn general, I have a very tough time judging the Second Breakfast decks because they are willing to go 1x or 2x with so many cards to create more versatility and I hate doing anything less than 3x for almost any card, even uniques, unless I know that I don't really NEED it... but at that point I tend to just take it out of the deck to make room for cards that I do need. Then again, they are limited to 1 core set, so the lack of 3x for the Spirit cancellation events is understandable.\n\nI don't know. I'm just not impressed, especially since they didn't spoil any cards from The Antlered Crown to build it (like they did with the Gondor deck that spoiled Gondorian Shield). I hope the second deck at least has one spoiler."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128913-the-woodland-realms-unite-part-one/?do=findComment&comment=1364436","commentId":1364436,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1418330890,"content":"I was expecting one spoiled card at the end which would be in the next deck but now I think that we will get no more Silvan cards in the last AP.
