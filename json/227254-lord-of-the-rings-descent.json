From what I remember, I think they have just card game, (Curse you GW!) and this has probably already been mentioned in the forums. In any case, what do you think the chances of getting a LOTR game in the style of Descent or IA? I'd say little to none but wouldn't that be so fun!? I understand there is little at times to differentiate between the two aside from setting and I don't think there is a huge market for the setting at the moment to produce miniatures and everything, but I still think it would be cool!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227254-lord-of-the-rings-descent/?do=findComment&comment=2356039","commentId":2356039,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1470775642,"content":"Well wizkidz released Lord of the Rings Heroclix but I suspect that the dreaded Games Workshop still has a big hold over rights to Lord of the Rings miniatures due to their wargames they have for it.
