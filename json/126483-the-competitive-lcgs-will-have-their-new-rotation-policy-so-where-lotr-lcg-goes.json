It is only relevant for tournaments and competitive players anyway. Me and a couple of friends used to play magic casually only. And guess what, for the longest time I never even new there was something like rotation or formats. We just built our decks from our own private card-pool and had tons of fun.\n\n \n\nIirc, there was the idea in the early days of the game to have competitive events where groups of players compete against the same scenario and compare scores thereafter. It could be fun and you could use certain deckbuilding constraints to prevent everybody from showing up with the same decks (i.e. each group of players gets a different set of deckbuilding conditions to meet). However, and that is the beauty of this game, nobody prevents your local game group from doing just that. Sometimes I feel that people forget that there is a world outside of competitive card-gaming, too!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126483-the-competitive-lcgs-will-have-their-new-rotation-policy-so-where-lotr-lcg-goes/?do=findComment&comment=1332896","commentId":1332896,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1415875873,"content":"rotation makes no sense for this game..

The TCGs that I played had similar numbers and I've always complained that they come out too fast. Granted, with TCGs you need a lot more time (and money) to actually collect all the cards, so the pace was even worse. Still, I have no complaints about the number of player cards we receive. The pace is too fast for casual players, just about right for semi-casual players, and apparently too slow for hardcore players. The only complaint I have is the lack of consistency in the release schedule."}]}
