Especially the second part.\n\nWhile I would agree it is not as easy as one should expect of a Dif. 4, there is no simple 'you lost' draw on the encounter deck. Even if you flip a second Troll or, a beastmaster, or the Adder, whatever; you always have a chance.\n\n \n\nThe most appealing facet of this game is that you can overcome (almost) impossible odds, in the face of death, after losing two of your Heroes, you pull that nice strategy in your mind and then, BOOM! Shakalaka. You made it! You won!\n\nCrap. It is way more interesting to win after being almost decimated than just 'Rohannize' the quest after a couple of turns.\n\n \n\nI still do'nt have a good Rhosgobel win ratio, and that's the reason I build several decks to beat the entire cycle instead of a single scenario. I have to plan accordingly to each scenario's strengths. So, in Rhosgobel, I either must have a good deal of healing, or lots of shadow-meta and treachery-meta. It's nice to play that way.\n\n \n\n \n\nMore to the point, the Trolls can be managed by Gimli or Gandalf, and then, be bombardied (sp?) by a good lot of 1-2 cost guys... or again, Gimli.\n\nThat Orc with victory points in the Anduin is more of a worry than the Trolls, in my opinion, if you don't kill it soon, he'll be a PAIN to deal with. The adder is another one you should worry; still, after all being said, last night I had 16 (out of 24) points of victory in Anduin, defeating (IIRC) 2 Trolls, 2 victory locations and the orc mentioned earlier.\n\n \n\nHope it helps. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=584117","commentId":584117,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1327406961,"content":"Ser Folly said:\n\nBudgernaut said:\n\n \n\nWow!

It's just hard because if you have one hero quest, one defend, and one attack, you'll never do damage to the hill troll unless you get Gimli, Gandalf, or can play lots of heroes.

What a gem this thread is! I'm in the same situation, stuck on Anduin with solo play. I only have one core set and have only been playing since Christmas, but this thread gave me some great ideas. The interesting thing is that I played some 4 player games when I first got it and we beat every single game and played all three scenarios from the core set. I'm playing solo now and it feels impossible! After reading this, though, I think I'll try Anduin again.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWow, have you been playing with the standard decks of the coreset?\n\n \n\nI tried Anduin thrice solo and twice with three players and the standard decks and closest I got to winning (that is I killed the troll) was in one solo game.\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen I played with 4 players it was with the standard core sets, and we probably ruled some minor things incorrectly which seems to be common, but with the solo decks I've been trying to multisphere. It's just hard because if you have one hero quest, one defend, and one attack, you'll never do damage to the hill troll unless you get Gimli, Gandalf, or can play lots of heroes. I agree with the above statement, I feel like you pretty much need Gandalf in your starting hand to have a chance at this one.\n\n\n\nI never use gimli in solo play..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=584842","commentId":584842,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1327522752,"content":"booored said:\n\n \n\nI never use gimli in solo play...\n\n\n\nStrangely enough, the wealth of dwarf cards that have appeared has made Gimli less appealing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=585008","commentId":585008,"userName":"Xeodus","timestamp":1327565287,"content":"Tried last night with tactics and spirit combo of Legolas, Glorfindel and Brand (starting threat of 28) with a heavy eagles sub theme, still failed overall due to reaching 50 threat but was able to handle the troll without to much hassle.  Going to try again tonight and see if I can pull it off.  Surge can really be a game changer when your thinking your in good shape."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=585026","commentId":585026,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1327568292,"content":"Xeodus said:\n\nTried last night with tactics and spirit combo of Legolas, Glorfindel and Brand (starting threat of 28) with a heavy eagles sub theme, still failed overall due to reaching 50 threat but was able to handle the troll without to much hassle.  Going to try again tonight and see if I can pull it off.  Surge can really be a game changer when your thinking your in good shape.\n\n\n\n\ni would say ditch glorfindel, thats one of the reasons why your threat maxed out probably"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=585059","commentId":585059,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1327575527,"content":" Success! I finally beat this scenario last night! Here’s how it happened:\nCard Pool: 1 Core Set\nHeroes: Thalin, Eowyn, Dunhere (26 threat)\nDeck: Spirit starter deck, all 1 and 2 cost Tactics cards except Rain of Arrows, and Gandalf (3x)\n\nGame 1\nI was totally overwhelmed by enemies and all my heroes were killed. After the game I realized that I was allowing the Eastern Crows Surge to happen before Thalin took them out. I also forgot to add excess Hill Troll damage to my threat.\n\nGame 2\nI exceeded 50 threat. Got Blade of Gondolin on Dunhere so he could attack the staging area, but when I beat stage 1, I quickly got Marsh Adder, Chieftan Ufthak, and 2 Gladden Fields in addition to various other enemies. I didn’t have enough Will to overcome that, but didn’t have enough allies in play to optionally engage. With Blade of Gondolin, I think I got 3 or 4 progress tokens on the quest before losing.\n\nGame 3\nI finally won!\nIt took 13 rounds and I ended with 19 threat and 4 damage on my heroes. I collected 8 Victory Points so my final score was 145 (revised) or 15 (old). I got a Dwarven Axe on both Thalin and Dunhere and also had Unexpected Courage on Dunhere. Eowyn had The Favor of the Lady.\n\nI drew a Treachery card to start with, so the Hill Troll was the only enemy in the beginning. Dunhere got the axe on round 2 and started chipping away at the Hill Troll until I played Gandalf (lowered threat) and had him defend while Thalin, Dunhere and Northern Tracker finished off the troll. I used both Galadhrim’s Greetings and used it a third time with Dwarven Tomb. Other allies were Northern Tracker, Gondorian Spearman, and Veteran Axehand. Stage 2 was easy with Eowyn, Northern Tracker, and Thalin questing while Dunhere attacked twice (UC) into the staging area to clean it up (at 4 atk). I drew a lot of Eastern Crows because they get shuffled in when defeated. For Stage 3 setup, a Treachery and a Location card were revealed, so I won."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=585095","commentId":585095,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1327580037,"content":"Congrats on the win!  You don't actually add the 10 points until the END of the round under the new scoring system, so your score is actually a 135."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59174-drowning-on-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=585101","commentId":585101,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1327580628,"content":"radiskull said:\n\nCongrats on the win!  You don't actually add the 10 points until the END of the round under the new scoring system, so your score is actually a 135.\n\n\n\nThanks!
