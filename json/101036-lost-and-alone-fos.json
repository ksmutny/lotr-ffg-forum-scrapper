You will continue playing \nuntil you either draw the hero, are eliminated through \nother means, or the game ends.\"\n \nWhich means that the original question is a tricky and interesting one - I don't know what the answer is. One possibility would be to say that this means you lose - undefended damage HAS to go on a hero. If you don't have a hero in play, you can't satisfy this, so you lose. Maybe."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101036-lost-and-alone-fos/?do=findComment&comment=1009877","commentId":1009877,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1394567260,"content":"Ah ok...got it wrong then, thanks for looking it up jj.\n\nOdd ruling though IMO.\n\nI don't get it really...are they trying to be as vague as they can be with some of these rulings???\n\nEdited March 11, 2014 by Noccus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101036-lost-and-alone-fos/?do=findComment&comment=1011833","commentId":1011833,"userName":"LukeZZ","timestamp":1394728980,"content":"Yes, it's not clear... what happens when you have no heroes (because some of them are now in your deck) and an enemy makes un uncontested attack?
