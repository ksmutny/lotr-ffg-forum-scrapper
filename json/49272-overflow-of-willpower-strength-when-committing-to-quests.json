Lets say that after some time in a particular quests, a location has been traveled too and it only requires 3 progress points to be completed. Lets say all players and enemies points balance out to having something like +5 willpower strength, finishing off the active location and leaving a +2. Does this extra 2 points get added to the current quest or is it lost in time and space?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49272-overflow-of-willpower-strength-when-committing-to-quests/?do=findComment&comment=493146","commentId":493146,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1309384555,"content":"It gets added to the quest.\n\nWillpower overflow from location to quest, but not from quest to quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49272-overflow-of-willpower-strength-when-committing-to-quests/?do=findComment&comment=493166","commentId":493166,"userName":"Coldmoonrising","timestamp":1309388476,"content":" Thank you, that's what I thought after a few times playing quests repeatedly."}]}
