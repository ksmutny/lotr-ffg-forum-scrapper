I played kind of sloppy even though I took my time (first time with this version of the these decks, chalk it up to that).  Elrohir was killed halfway through, which made defense trickier.  Cirdan with Narya was the key to winning with his multiple readyings.  The Ambush trap played a saving role a couple of times, preventing some character exhaustions by defeating a particular enemy before it could attack.  Beorn took only two hits: 2nd round from Sahir put 7 damage on him, then one hit again later on from a tentacle that put 2 more damage on him (no shadow effect, reduced from a fatal 3 damage by an Honour Guard).  Here's the kicker: I discarded TWO copies of Steward of Gondor (per Cirdan's effect in the resource phase) in the resource-starved Noldor deck after Elrohir died.  I thought I had no way to play Leadership cards, forgetting that Cirdan had a purple icon thanks to Narya.  Boy, that would have changed the flow of the game.  Won in the end, anyway.  Not such a hard scenario.  It feels like a mix between Foundations of Stone (encounter deck morphing minus the separate staging areas) and of course Watcher in the Water."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221613-allied-by-a-common-cause/?do=findComment&comment=2251625","commentId":2251625,"userName":"Mikallo","timestamp":1465085093,"content":"> I want Brok Ironfist hero.
