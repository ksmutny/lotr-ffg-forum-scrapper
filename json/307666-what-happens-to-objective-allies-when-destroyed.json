An example in Celador from Into Ithilien, his text says: While Celador is in the staging area, he is committed to the current quest. Forced: After players quest unsuccessfully or a character leaves play, deal 1 damage to Celador. If Celador leaves play, remove him from the game.\n\n \n\nSo, if nothing is telling you otherwise, the ally goes to the discard pile.  Gildor can be revealed again later in the scenario if you reshuffle (or if you tech for it, like bringing the player card Shadow of the Past)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307666-what-happens-to-objective-allies-when-destroyed/?do=findComment&comment=3927037","commentId":3927037,"userName":"steve83","timestamp":1586792364,"content":"To be clear: which discard pile?
