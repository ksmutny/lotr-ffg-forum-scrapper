The Nazgul that's used on the third quest states something like \"when a shadow effect resolves discard a character\". Several questions about this:\n\n- If the only character I have is the only one that's able to defend (and I've chosen him to do so), what happens? He is discarded and the attack goes undefended? It still counts for defense?\n\n- On the other hand, if the Nazgul is dealt a card without a shadow effect, is his ability triggered or not? I saw in the FAQ that if you cancel the shadow effect with a card then his ability is not triggered.\n\nThanks,\n\nJavier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49490-about-the-nazgul/?do=findComment&comment=495294","commentId":495294,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1309873720,"content":"The character is discarded and the attack goes undefended.\n\nIf there is no shadow effect, then the Nazgul's ability doesn't trigger."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49490-about-the-nazgul/?do=findComment&comment=496170","commentId":496170,"userName":"Iver2","timestamp":1310018702,"content":"Kiwina said:\n\nIf there is no shadow effect, then the Nazgul's ability doesn't trigger.\n\n\n\nWell, I think it says something like when a shadow card is dealt...I am at work now and I cannot look that up.  Can somebody please clarify that for us?\n\nBut I think the ability triggers regardless of any shadow effect.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49490-about-the-nazgul/?do=findComment&comment=496427","commentId":496427,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1310054440,"content":"If there's no shadow effect, the ability doesn't trigger.\n\nIt's covered by the FAQ:\n\nQ.
