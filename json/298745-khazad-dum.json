With this deluxe I really tried to stick 100% to dwarfs but with the cards available (progression) it's really tough. I'm wary of making it so tough on myself that I'll lose interest. Theme-wise you could at least imagine some humans/elves (Spearman or Runner) coming along on the quest perhaps. I draw the line at using things like eagles inside Moria.\n\nI think KD is a bit weird theme-wise, in general. If you're being strict then you wouldn't be allowed to use any of The Fellowship characters (except maybe Gandalf?) here - according to the books/movies. Having read about the other deluxe sets it sounds like KD is a deluxe that stands alone in this sense (which is a relief). I do wonder when they made this deluxe if they had any idea they would be making more - as sometimes it doesn't feel this is the case.\n\nThe 2nd scenario in this deluxe feels almost exactly like the troll scene from the book/movie - which is both great (I really enjoyed it) but also a bit weird (as it's not supposed to?)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298745-khazad-dum/?do=findComment&comment=3763245","commentId":3763245,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1565801166,"content":"> On 8/12/2019 at 7:23 PM, Vince79 said:\n> \n> That has been my observation as well.  Throw as many allies out there as quick as you can. \n> \n> Here is my deck, which as I said I got from someone else off the internet.  I haven't even really looked at tweaking it yet, but I'm certainly open to suggestions.  Apologies that it isn't in the linked format posters here prefer, laziness on my part I guess:\n> \n> Heroes:  Dain Ironfoot (Leadership), Bifur (Lore), and Thalin (Tactics)\n> \n> Miner of the Iron Hills     3      (Lore)\n> Erebor Record Keeper     3      (Lore)\n> Erebor Hammersmith     2      (Lore)\n> Longbeard Map-Maker   2      (Lore)\n> Longbeard Orc Slayer     1      (Leadership)\n> Veteran Axehand             3      (Tactics)\n> Gondorian Spearman     3      (Tactics)\n> Gandalf                             3      (Neutral)\n> Faramir                             1      (Leadership)\n> Gleowine                          3      (Lore)\n> Henamarth Riversong     1      (Lore)\n> Daughter of the Nimrodel 2      (Lore)\n> \n> Steward of Gondor     3      (Leadership)\n> Celebrian's Stone       1      (Leadership)\n> Narvi's Belt                  1      (Leadership)\n> Boots from Erebor     3      (Neutral)\n> Dwarrowdelf Axe         2      (Tactics)\n> Horn of Gondor           1      (Tactics)\n> Dunedain Warning     2      (Leadership)\n> \n> Durin's Song             3      (Leadership)          \n> Khazad!

I do use Bifur and Dain as well.\n\nGet as many dwarf allies as you can cos Dain will buff them (not just 2 but all three where you can). Depends upon what packs you have, and whether you're playing progression, but other cards to look out for: Dwarven (better than Dwarrowdelf) Axe IMO, Erebor Battle Master, Heavy Stroke, Lure of Moria, Longbeard Elder, Cram, Hardy leadership. I also like Ancestral Knowledge and ally leadership Gloin. Go for 3 x sneak attack. Swap non-Dwarf allies for Dwarves and dump any cards that give you defence (i.e. dunedain warning / boots from erebor).\n\nHere's my Dwarf Deck:\n\nDain (L), Bifur (Lo), Gimli (T)\n\n3 x Gandalf N\n\n3 x Steward of Gondor L\n\n3 x Faramir L\n\n3 x Erebor Battle Master T\n\n3 x Ally Gloin L\n\n3 x Miner of Iron Hills Lo\n\n3 x Erebor Record Keeper Lo\n\n3 x Erebor Hammersmith Lo\n\n3 x Longbeard Mapmaker Lo\n\n3 x Longbeard Elder L\n\n3 x Veteran Axehand T\n\n3 x Khazad Khazad T\n\n3 x Dwarven Axe T\n\n3 x Lure of Moria L\n\n3 x Cram L\n\n3 x Ancestral Knowledge Lo\n\n3 x Heavy Stroke T\n\n51 cards - 30 Allies (inc 6 non-Dwarf). Steward of Gondor goes on Dain ASAP (don't need sneak attack for that reason) and deploy one resource each turn to Bifur. If you want to take your deck down to 50, then lose 1 Gloin. Bifur is used for questing along with high WP allies, Gimli for attacks. Sacrifice lore allies against enemies if necessary cos they're cheap.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n \n\n \n\nEdited August 14, 2019 by JonG"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298745-khazad-dum/?do=findComment&comment=3763314","commentId":3763314,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1565803630,"content":"@JonG [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/280142-jong/] I'd be curious to hear your case for Dwarven Axe over Dwarrowdelf Axe."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298745-khazad-dum/?do=findComment&comment=3763339","commentId":3763339,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1565805211,"content":"> 24 minutes ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> @JonG [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/280142-jong/] I'd be curious to hear your case for Dwarven Axe over Dwarrowdelf Axe.\n\nOoops!
