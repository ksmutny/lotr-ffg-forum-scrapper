The first time I checked, everything but The Steward's Fear was in stock and I thought I missed it, only to see it back in stock a few days later.\n\nSo as it stands now I have full saga and the first four cycles. Plus the Dread Realm for \"reasons\" haha.\n\nAt this point I'm in a quandary, I don't feel like I'm playing the game enough to justify such an intense acquisition of product but when it is so hard to find I wonder if I should keep diving for it every time I see it? I have so much to explore and play as it is. Even if I'm not building decks progression style I am collecting that way (Saga sets an exception) and still want to play the quests \"in order\" which puts me back in Khazad-Dum.\n\nAll that to say I would also encourage vigilance to anyone looking to complete their collection. I have been checking FFG's website almost weekly (sometimes daily) for several months to get to where I am at now with my collection. If you keep looking long enough you will get the sets you're looking for!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299193-ffg-stock-is-replenished-ive-collected-them-all/?do=findComment&comment=3771649","commentId":3771649,"userName":"PigsAreOurEquals","timestamp":1566846412,"content":" \n\n> 12 hours ago, JacobSerruys said:\n> \n> I'm located near Ghent.
