Reasoning: \"optional engagement\" is an effect defined in the rulebook. Son of Arnor's Response is a separate type of effect that comes solely from its card, which does not refer to \"optional engagement\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66180-son-of-arnor-trick-angainst-the-watcher-when-he-is-in-the-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=646303","commentId":646303,"userName":"PESKPESK","timestamp":1340083929,"content":"Thx, but there is no official ruling or FAQ on this yet?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66180-son-of-arnor-trick-angainst-the-watcher-when-he-is-in-the-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=646326","commentId":646326,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1340087343,"content":"I don't see anything preventing you from engaging the Watcher this way.\n\nJust a clever way to get him while there is tentacles are all around.
