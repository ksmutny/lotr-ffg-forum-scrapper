Moreover most of my favourite characters are in the Tactics sphere (Legolas, Hama, Landroval, Bard, Boromir, Beregond, Elladan), I like eagles a lot and I love to put one (or two) blade of gondolin on Leoglas to progress more by killing than by questing, I also enjoy Hama+blade of gondolin+foe hammer.\n\n \n\nMy second favourite sphere would be Leadership : I just love to have resources to play everything just when I need it. Sneak attack and Steward of Gondor are two of the strongest cards in the game (I love them). There are a few characters I like (Aragorn, Boromir, Imrahil, Elrohir, Theodred, Faramir). One of the features I love is boosting WP with faramir (sometimes twice with ever vigilant)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83750-poll-whats-your-favourite-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=794648","commentId":794648,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1368351083,"content":"My favorite is Lore.  Lore can quest, fight (Haldir, Mirkwood Runner, Gildor), Look at encounter deck (Gildor's Counsel, Denethor,) Heal, of course, and they got ranger spikes.  yeah… I think they are the most balenced sphere.\n\nSecond is Tactics.  I just love all the attachments they have.  I also love the eagles and other allies.  They have the most fun Heroes I think.\n\n \n\nKhamul"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83750-poll-whats-your-favourite-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=794651","commentId":794651,"userName":"klaymen_sk","timestamp":1368351436,"content":"My favourite is Tactics.

I find Dori to be among the best. I also like both Henamarth Riversong and Dúnedain Watcher. I am not very fond of some of the new Outlands, I wish they were all more like Hunter of Lamedon (Hirluin, Swordsman and Knights are good though).\n\nAs for the original question, my favourite sphere is Lore also. But not to play really right now. I agree its strategies are most intriguing. They are just not that developed or effective yet, compared to Spirit. I like all the spheres, however, and their distinction. I feel this was a masterful idea, and it is one that makes the game so very special. Having traits is obvious, and I hope some of the lesser traits (Warrior, Ranger) will be soon developed, as will all the national or race traits, of course; but the spheres are extra."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83750-poll-whats-your-favourite-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=794890","commentId":794890,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1368417400,"content":"I agree with you Ileimmoen !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83750-poll-whats-your-favourite-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=795087","commentId":795087,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1368463802,"content":"I gotta say tactics.
