A good thing about the response (which you of course need not trigger) is that it shuffles the deck; this is becoming increasingly important in my mono-Lore decks, and it will be great for Scroll of Isildur - which puts the event onto the bottom of the deck.

With all these new 3+ ATT enemies all of the mentioned heroes will bite the dust sooner than later.\n\n \n\nTracker. Using a mono leadership deck with Boromir, Aragorn and Prince Imrahil  you can play StwB on turn 1, raising your WP to a total of 8 immediatly. Faramir or Denetor (ally) can give you another boost next turn, given that you have one of the many Gondor cards in your hand that increase your pool of resources. or you play all these 1 cost allies that profit from Aragorn's, Boromir's and Faramir's boosts.

All of them solo.\n\n \n\nIt's simple for me: this is the most difficult quest for solo players in all the cycle. I don't know about 2+ players yet, but solo is not only difficult, its beautiful. It has some neat mechanics. It's a mix of race against the clock (you have an objective card that other encounter cards put tokens on it and if you have 10 you lose the game, and there are HIGH chances to put tokens) and brutal combat.\n\n \n\nWhen I say brutal combat I mean solid enemies: the ones from Mordor Elite and Creatures of the Forest are cool, the Captains of Morgul Vale have powerful stats, like 4 to 7 attack or 5 to 7 hit poitns. But stats are not the problem. The problem are how their abilities are so well connected with other cards.\n\n \n\nFor instance, the first Captain after he attacks he reveals a card and if it's an enemy (and there's high chances, because this scenario is full of them) he puts it engaged with the player. The second Captain when he attacks he puts a progress token on the objective, and of course there are enemies or treacheries that react to that and also he attacks again if there was no shadow effect when revealing a shadow card, basically attacking twice. Even the locations are really nasty, but more or less easy to explore. And then you have the spiders or Lieutenant of Mordor...\n\n \n\nI've played with dwarfs deck, the Thorin & Co. deck from Glaurung (with a bit fo tuning by my part). And they raped me.\n\n \n\nI think that here a good Gondor deck with nice defense can come in handy. My best try was arriving at the final quest, and I decided to rush it. And then, bam, shadow effect where the enemy has +1 strength for each token on the objective. There my heroes started to fall.\n\n \n\nThis is one of those quests that makes you think about taking right decisions, and not facerolling.\n\n \n\nAnd for the Alcaron traitor, well I prefer not to spoil anything right now, but the story continues and ends in an interesting way. Actually there were 2 inserts to explain all what was left of the story.\n\nEdited November 15, 2013 by Jekzer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93450-morgul-vale-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=909777","commentId":909777,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1384544654,"content":"So much for flavor and storytelling in this pack... and yet you can actually play with Faramir even though he's been captured.

The prospector is also really good. Lay of Nimrodel is fine, but I was fearing we would get a Magali Villeneuve art for it. It's just getting a little tiring for me. She's good, but they're using her way too much.

I'm excited about this AP.  The Theoden and Rohan synergies are intriguing and we haven't even technically gotten into Rohan territory yet!  Discarding a card for beneficial effect is a very interesting idea and will provide some great new options for deckbuilding, especially against certain scenarios. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93450-morgul-vale-player-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=911398","commentId":911398,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1384798983,"content":"> I'll take the mantle of movie-hater.  One of the best things about this game is that it's based on the books, not the movies.  The movies were okay, but I think each one has gotten progressively farther from the intentions of the author.  The Hobbit was enough to finally push me too far.  I won't be seeing any more of Peter Jackson's adaptations.  They really have become his stories.\n\nI would always agree that An Unexpected Journey was by far the closest to the book, of all the Middle-earth movies so far.\n\n \n\nI think the Fellowship might be the best movie of them all but it really just skips most of the Book 1, my favourite.

Cards can also gain a boost by the number of progress on the cards.\n\nWhite Bridge location (added at 3rd quest card) will get threat and quest point increase due to this progress on the objective\n\nMost treachery cards place progress. The only one that deals damage to characters is Masters Malice.\n\nThere are plenty of attack boosting shadow effects. Some return enemy to staging area, and one will have enemy attack next player, which in solo is usually not good.\n\nOverall there are 17 enemy, 6 location, and 14 treachery in encounter deck.\n\nDoomed keyword is pretty common, and a few surge cards, which are not so bad.\n\nI think the scenario will need a specific type of deck and it will probably not be easy.
