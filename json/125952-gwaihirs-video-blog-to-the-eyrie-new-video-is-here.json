The more that I think about it, I believe that you are correct, Gwaihir and that \"Indestructible\" is the only keyword on The Balrog. Out of curiosity I went back and checked the rulebook:\n \n\nKeywords are used as shorthand for common \ngame effects that appear on a number of cards. The \nkeywords and their role in the game are explained \nbelow. Keywords are denoted textually, usually at the \n\nbeginning of a card’s rules text.\n\nNothing about this definition would preclude text like \"Immune to player card effects\" or \"No attachments\" from being considered keywords. The rulebook says nothing about a keyword having to be a single word. In fact, Victory X is listed as an example of a keyword, so they clearly can't be limited to a single word. It would be nice to have a definitive explanation for what a keyword is, or at least a definitive list of keywords. In my search engine, I have chosen to classify most words and sentences (basically anything that ends in a \".\") at the top of a card (above the main text) as keywords. The distinction has never really mattered before, but The Balrog makes it matter from a rules standpoint. I still think that you are correct, but this is a bit ambiguous. For example, if \"no attachments\" or \"immune to player card effects\" are not a keywords, then why are they listed right next to keywords on so many cards?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1316568","commentId":1316568,"userName":"Gwaihir Lord of the Winds","timestamp":1414666147,"content":"This is interesting indeed, Mr. Beorn.

This makes sense, but is also ludicrously impractical. When playing Journey in the Dark, I am not going to go back to every other rules sheet for every expansion printed to date to confirm what is and is not a keyword. Since I have never sacrificed a hero to the Balrog in any of my play-throughs (I just take the burdens), I suppose it doesn't really matter for me. Still, I want Hall of Beorn Card Search to be accurate about what is and is not a keyword, and I rather dread going back through all of the rules sheets to compile a list...\n\nEdited October 30, 2014 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1317119","commentId":1317119,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1414701536,"content":"As far as I can tell, all the \"single word\" game texts are keywords, following the literal interpretation of a \"key word\" -- not plural \"words.\"  If you look at it that way, phrases like \"immune to player card effects\" naturally separate themselves from the keyword crowd."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1317218","commentId":1317218,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1414707398,"content":"Beorn, i do not yet own all AP's, so I could easily make a .doc list with all keywords if you'd like that?\n\nAP also stands for(this time) DE, Saga and PoD\n\nEdited October 30, 2014 by gandalfDK"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1317285","commentId":1317285,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1414711787,"content":"> As far as I can tell, all the \"single word\" game texts are keywords\n\n \n\nIs \"Doomed 2\" a single word?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1317341","commentId":1317341,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1414718415,"content":"@gamdalfDK, thanks for the offer.

The only cases of this however are the trolls from We Must Away and Great Cave Troll from Khazad Dum.\n\n \n\nThese two Nazgul bosses have the same wording but I believe were errated to read \"cannot have attachments\"\n\nThe-Witch-King.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Massing-at-Osgiliath/The-Witch-King.png]\n\nNazg%C3%BBl-of-Dol-Guldur.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Core-Set/Nazg%C3%BBl-of-Dol-Guldur.png]\n\nIf not for the errata Ranger Spikes would affect them also. It thematically makes no sense for a Nazgul atop a Fell Beast to be in any way deterred by ranger spikes so fair enough that they were errated. It would also shut these two bosses down entirely and make them far easier.\n\n \n\nAlso like the nightmare trolls in conflict at the carrock there are also encounter cards that read \"cannot have player attachments\" so that they can still have encounter attachments. It seems like this defines what type of attachment they can have and no attachments/cannot have attachments seems to me to be exactly the same. No attachments of any kind can be put on the enemy. It is annoying that they change the way things are phrased sometimes in this game.... can make things rather confusing.\n\nEdited October 31, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1317437","commentId":1317437,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1414728973,"content":"> @gamdalfDK, thanks for the offer.

Don't stop making videos just because you can't make great videos. If you end up being able to save up for a nicer camera, great, but don't feel obligated either."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1330823","commentId":1330823,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1415733618,"content":"To be clear:  the content is fantastic.  The game play, deck building and explanations as you go along are great."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1336845","commentId":1336845,"userName":"Gwaihir Lord of the Winds","timestamp":1416202606,"content":"> I can't watch.

I tried my best to cancel all background noises in the editing process, but not everything is going to be completely cancelled."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1336846","commentId":1336846,"userName":"Gwaihir Lord of the Winds","timestamp":1416202655,"content":"> To be honest you need to increase quality of video as well.

Thanks for watching in the mean time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1336848","commentId":1336848,"userName":"Gwaihir Lord of the Winds","timestamp":1416202952,"content":">  \n> \n> > To be honest you need to increase quality of video as well.

I record with my macbook pro's camera, so it is not the best. I don't have the money to purchase a nice camera and microphone. I am sorry for the poor quality. If I get some extra cash I might look into upgrading. Since I do this just for fun, I don't know if I can justify spending the money for new equipment. Gwaihir has too many bills to pay, sadly...\n\n \n\nI appreciate the encouragement to continue to make videos though. It is nice to hear from you! I am in the process of making more videos with the new Silvan cards and Galadriel who just came out. Going to go through the entire Ring maker cycle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1336849","commentId":1336849,"userName":"Gwaihir Lord of the Winds","timestamp":1416203012,"content":"> To be clear:  the content is fantastic.  The game play, deck building and explanations as you go along are great.\n\nThank you very much! I totally understand, as I do not like the video/audio quality myself. I wish I had money to go out and buy good equipment today so I can produce better video play-through for you fans. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125952-gwaihirs-video-blog-to-the-eyrie-new-video-is-here/?do=findComment&comment=1336954","commentId":1336954,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1416218903,"content":"Is ok man.
