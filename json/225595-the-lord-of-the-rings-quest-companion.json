You'll find a great ressource for card search at hallofbeorn.com [http://hallofbeorn.com]\n\n-- A Setting the game and Round sequence summary reference to help beginners (and not beginners) to cope with the learning curve.\n\n-- You can also record your Campaign progression in the online Campaign Log:\n\n \n\nCampaign Log [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/campaignlog/]\n\n \n\npic2605471_t.jpg [https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2605471_t.jpg] [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2605471]\n\n\n \n\nSorting\n\n \n\npic2610997_t.jpg [https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2610997_t.jpg] [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2610997]\n\nYou can sort quests by:\n\n-- Cycle\n-- Alphabetically\n-- Official difficulty\n-- User difficulty rating\n\n \n\nErratas and Q&A for Quests and Encounter Cars\n\n \n\n \n\npic1834196_t.jpg [https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1834196_t.jpg] [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1834196]\n\n \n\nHome page goodies\n\n \n\nThe home page displays the hardest and easiest quests according to players. So that's a good entry point for one who'd like to buy adventure packs with easy quest for example.\n\nThe home page also features a quest at random. I'm often a bit overwhelmed by the amount of quests available, so having a random choice is nice. And if you really don't like it, just refresh the page and a new quest will be proposed.\n\n \nPlayer cards erratas, Q&A and official rulings\n\n \n\npic1896910_t.jpg [https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1896910_t.jpg] [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1896910]\n\n\n\nWhen doing a card search on the \"card reference\" on the right of the screen, you now have access to Erratas, Q&A and other official information provided by FFG in the FAQ.\n \n\nRound Sequence Summary\n\n \n\npic1896911_t.jpg [https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1896911_t.jpg] [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1896911]\n\n\n\nI'm also providing a Round Sequence Summary which contains most information new players will need to cope with the learning curve of the game, before moving to advanced notions.\n\nThere is a also a Setting the game section, which I find is the most important add-on here, considering I often get lost on what to do when preparing the game, especially when playing Nightmare mode and Campaign mode which adds several Setup actions to perform in the right order.\n\nAs in with the rule book, you can select what information should appear on the summary, depending on the difficulty mode and if you're playing Saga / Campaign.\n\nFor instance, the \"Setting the Game Section\" when you're playing The Black Riders in Campaign mode as well as Easy mode:\n\npic1896917_t.jpg [https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1896917_t.jpg] [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1896917]\n\n\n\nEventually, by clicking on the \"Show/Hide Action Windows\", you can display well... the action windows, if you ever need to be remembered of them.\n\npic1896928_t.jpg [https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1896928_t.jpg] [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1896928]\nEdited July 22, 2016 by banania"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225595-the-lord-of-the-rings-quest-companion/?do=findComment&comment=2322657","commentId":2322657,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1469220238,"content":"So the site has recently undergone a large update:\n\n \n\nThe remainder of the Angmar Awakened Cycle:\n\n- The Dread Realm [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/angmar-awakened-quest-the-dread-realm.html]\n\nThe Grey Havens Deluxe expansion:\n\n- Voyage across Belegaer [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/the-grey-havens-quest-voyage-across-belegaer.html]\n- The Fate of Numenor [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/the-grey-havens-quest-the-fate-of-numenor.html]\n- Raid on the Grey Havens [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/the-grey-havens-quest-raid-on-the-grey-havens.html]\n\nAndthe first three quests of The Dream-Chaser Cycle:\n- Flight of the Stormcaller [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/the-dream-chaser-quest-flight-of-the-stormcaller.html]\n- The Things in the Depths [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/the-dream-chaser-quest-the-thing-in-the-depths.html]\n\n- Temple of the Deceived [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/the-dream-chaser-quest-temple-of-the-deceived.html]\n\nFor Temple of the Deceived [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/the-dream-chaser-quest-temple-of-the-deceived.html] rules I took the liberty to add the following chart:\n\n \n\nquest-progress.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/a5/fd/a5fd6984-fed1-4a30-ade2-457fa2c34155/quest-progress.png]\n\nThis chart was published in the announcement news [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/1/6/temple-of-the-deceived/] so it's all very official.
