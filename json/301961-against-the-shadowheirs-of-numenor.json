There is a lot of Battle questing, and Siege questing. I would recommend Spirit Glorfindel since he quests for 3 and attacks for 3, so he's good for regular questing and Battle questing.\n\n \n\nCheck out my Quest Log on RingsDB for this quest.

direction of mono-Tactics.  I wouldn't have thought of that.\n\nOne problem with The Steward's Fear is that you are so dependent on what comes up in the encounter deck and the underworld deck to make progress on your quests.  You really have little control over it, you need clue cards or locations to clear.  But if the locations come too quick, you can get location locked.  \n\n \n\n> 9 hours ago,

close is more questing power.  Because at the end you need to get those 15 quest points, but I run out of time (either cards or threat).  And unfortunately the deck tries to kill all your allies, so it's hard to build a big questing force.  I could add more expensive allies, but the deck also tries to steal all your resources, so it might be hard or impossible to pay for them.  It's something I

13 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Deck suggestions:\n\nThanks for the suggestions, Dale.  I'll discuss:\n\n1)  I had Vilya in the deck originally, but I took it out to make space for some different cards, and because I found I wasn't using it much.  I was needing Elrond to quest and sometimes to block, it didn't seem like there was much opportunity to exhaust him.  Stand and Fight is interesting.\n\n2)  Gondorian Shield sounds great, I'll be putting that in straight away.  I agree Winged Guardian is probably expendable.  There's some redundancy built into this deck because of the way this quest kills allies, and because of the way Up in Flames makes you discard cards.\n\n3)  Yeah, I'm not thrilled with Eomund.  He's only there to give me a hero with 2 will and 2 hit points.  Because I needed questing power and he won't die right away if you get that effect that deals 1 damage to all your allies.  Not crazy about the 3 cost.  I agree Bofur is better - did you mean the Spirit or Tactics version?  I had considered Elfhelm but he's 4 cost, this scenario likes to take your resources.  Not sure how often I could afford him.   I get Northern Tracker in now and then though, so I guess Elfhelm would be similar.\n\n4)  I think I had Envoy of Pelargir in the deck orginally, but I was trying to get rid of the 1 hit point allies, because they were getting killed so easily.\n\n5)  Not really thrilled by Favor of the Lady either, but I was trying to get more questing power.  I'd rather have Celebrian's Stone, but that's Leadership."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301961-against-the-shadowheirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=3854179","commentId":3854179,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1576989633,"content":"1) It's true that Elrond's actions are especially valuable, and with Spirit Glorfindel around you can't put Light of Valinor on him.  But you've got other defenders in the deck and you've got 3x Unexpected Courage -- there's some Vilya potential here.\n\n2) It's true that both stud ally defenders are 1 hp, and the quest (well, the Zealous Traitor) can make short work of them.  Of course, since it kills them all, multiplying doesn't help that much!  Elrond and Boromir both have excellent defensive potential.  I get making the deck fatter in case of Up in Flames, but you're only at 54 cards if I'm counting correctly.\n\n3) Elfhelm does cost 4 -- that's two turns worth of resources for Glorfindel and Elrond, which is also true of a 3-cost.  There's really only two cases where you really need Elfhelm -- Poisoned Counsels plot (he's always ready at end of turn) and Local Trouble (if you keep Elfhelm ready, Local Trouble can be completely ignored.  I hate Local Trouble, so that's reason enough to pack Elfhelm if you have double spirit (which you sort-of do with Elrond).  I did mean Spirit Bofur, it didn't even occur to me that OHUH came out before Steward's Fear.  I can never remember when the saga expansions dropped, especially since they tend to have a limited convention release months before the street release.\n\n4) Envoy of Pelargir is fragile (outside an Outlands deck with Sword of Morthond), but it's also very very cheap.  There's really only one enemy that afflicts all your fragile enemies, Zealous Traitor (3 copies in the Underworld Deck).  Knife in the Dark also targets an ally, but you *want* that one to hit your cheap Envoy instead of your hero-killing Gandalf.  So how do you deal with Zealous Traitor, besides dying?  Pack 3x Hail of Stones.  It only takes two characters to kill the Traitor in staging *before* he engages you, and Boromir can always be one of them.  (As an aside, I'm not a fan of the nerfed Horn of Gondor, but if you're playing against Zealous Traitor and have a bunch of 1-hp allies, it can pay out big.)\n\n5) There's a reasonable number of 2-cost, 2-hp allies with 1 willpower, which while they're a little more fragile than Favor of the Lady are also more versatile.  You should at least include a copy of Hennamarth Riversong.  I'm always reluctant to include 3x of any unique ally for fear of redundancy (unless they're absolutely crtical), but Henamarth is *so* good he's always worth at least a 1x in one-deck solo.\n\nYou've got a potentially strong questing situation in Steward's Fear itself, if you can lower yourself to play Outlands characters.  Put in 3x Ethir Swordsman (2-cost spirit) and 3x Anfalas Herdsman (1-cost lore).\n\nThe most recent pack released gave Spirit its own version of Celebrian's Stone (2-for-2, restricted), but in progression mode you won't be seeing that card for a long, long time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301961-against-the-shadowheirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=3854578","commentId":3854578,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1577061587,"content":"More suggestions, cool.\n\n1)  You are really trying to sell this Vilya thing, aren't you?  Are you getting a commission on old Elven rings?  I admit there's some potential there for it to get some use.  As I said before, I didn't find I was using it enough to be worth it.  But if you argue for it a third time you might convince me.\n\n2)  57 cards actually. But some think if you have more than 50, your favorite card will never come up.  I did drop Winged Guardian.  The idea of the multiple defenders wasn't that they'd all be on the table at the same time, but if one was killed it could later be replaced - theoretically.\n\n3)  I hate Local Trouble and Poisoned Councils.  Elfhelm is sounding better.  At this rate, I'd be more likely to stick him in there than Vilya.\n\n4)  I've considered Hail of Stones before, you've convinced me on that one.  It's going in.\n\n5)  Hennamarth Riversong is a possibility also.  I did try an Outland deck with this scenario also, didn't work very well. \n\nYou're right I won't see the new Celebrian's Stone for a while.  At this point, I'll probably be on The Steward's Fear for a long time, trying to prove something that I'm probably not going to be able to prove.  A lot of people say you should play this two handed solo, but that's not what I do.  Eventually I'll likely  get sick of it, take my win and

21 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> You should at least include a copy of Hennamarth Riversong.\n\nSo after our little discussion, I got a pretty easy win over The Steward's Fear.  I have to say, the stars of the day were Hail of Stones and Henamarth Riversong.  I got a little lucky in that I got two of these early on, and was able to use them both against Zealous Traitor.  That helped me keep more allies, so I was actually able to build up a decent force to take into the endgame.  The updated, altered deck is below.  \n\nI also threw in three Spear of the Citadel on a whim.  I might take it back out, it seems rather limited since you can only put it on Boromir.  Especially since right now there are 66 cards in the deck, might be a bit much?  What else looks disposable, Ancient Mathom and Favor of the Lady possibly (I feel a little better about the allies' health since adding Hail of Stones)?  Or should I leave it as is?  I'll try another game

It's actually kind of refreshing to see Elrond used without Vilya -- but it is an *extremely* powerful card.  However, Vilya works best with lots of expensive allies, and the unique ones all are 1x, and yours isn't that sort of deck.  I wouldn't put 3x Vilya in this deck or mulligan for it.  OTOH, just putting 1x Vilya in the deck would probably be worth your while -- you have 3x Unexpected Courage, and Elrond's the best target for that -- Spirit Glorfindel gets LoV and can quest and attack with just that, and Boromir can self-ready.  Once Elrond has U.C., he might have a spare action to Vilya something into play.\n\n2) I'm not one of the must-get-down-to-50 crew.  Even if you're mulliganing for a 3x card, the odds don't shift *that* much as you go from 50 cards to 60 cards, while dropping a card from 3x to 2x to get down to 50 alters the percentage of seeing that card much more.  Since 1/3rd of the time this quest goes after your deck, running with 57 cards can buy you another turn or two -- and Vilya would work against you here, \n\n3) Some quests Elfhelm is an expensive luxury -- this quest isn't one of them, he's great here.  I've been wrecked by Local Trouble more than once in this (and other quests that use it), and Poisoned Councils can run up the threat in a hurry.  Note that Elfhelm's a response, not a reducer, so if P.C. raises to 50 you threat out before Elfhelm uses his response to get back to 50.\n\n5) I've beaten this quest with Outlands before, though with my latest attempt in the solo league I failed on my zero-token run, thanks to my Anfalas herdsmen getting killed off.  But you'd need a different hero lineup for an Outlands deck and I'm not recommending you try that here -- it's just that Ethir Swordsmen *by themselves* are some of the best 2-cost questers in spirit, since they start at 2-for-2 and go up as more come out.  And Anfalas Herdsmen not only can quest if Swordsmen are out, they fix the Swordsmen's fragility problem.  Those are the only two Outlands allies that see use outside of Outlands deck (though a majority of Ethir Swordsman users don't supplement with Anfalas Herdsman).  If you had a full card pool there'd be a lot more great 2-cost questers, but you're pretty limited at this point in the card pool.\n\nSteward's Fear is tougher solo than with two decks, IMO.  It's also a quest with a heavy luck component, especially in terms of clues coming out of the Underworld deck.  If you get clues, you can wait to claim them until stage two, so you clear that quickly, get to the boss and take him out.  But because the variability of clues/plot/villain is so great, good decks can lose and weaker decks can win.  If you're getting frustrated, easy mode (or semi-easy) is a valid option; I also really like the Grace of the Valar variant Seastan invented that we use for the solo league."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301961-against-the-shadowheirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=3854612","commentId":3854612,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1577067854,"content":"Spear of Citadel only requires tactics characters, so it also can go on Defender of Rammas (or Veteran Axehand, though it's not much use there).  It's a fantastic card when it can be used to kill enemies when they attack -- Gondorian Spearman + Spear of the Citadel would kill your Dissedents, Traitors and Pickpockets without their attack resolving.  But that wouldn't prevent the Traitor's obnoxious when-engaged or Pickpockets when-attacks, so I'm not thrilled with the card in this deck against this quest.\n\nBTW, I may have misled you above -- Spirit doesn't get the actual Celebrian's Stone, they get a different card (Silver Circlet), that shares the essential characteristics of Celebrian's Stone -- 2 cost, +2 willpower, restricted slot.  The difference is that it's not unique (though it is limit one per player), it of course gives nothing extra to Aragorn, and it requires a spirit hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301961-against-the-shadowheirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=3855330","commentId":3855330,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1577149850,"content":">

You're like a dog with a bone, aren't you?  Actually, right now I think I'll jettison Spear of the Citadel and put in Elfhelm.  As you said, you can put the spear on Defender of Rammas, but that card

him. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301961-against-the-shadowheirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=3855365","commentId":3855365,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1577158085,"content":"Got
