Some of the others are very hard solo and can lead to frustration. Nice to have more local people playing by the way. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60980-if-i-was-only-able-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=598354","commentId":598354,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1330085650,"content":"Howlix said:\n\nIf I was only able to buy the core set and 2 expansions for this game from my local shop which expansions should I get?  I want the most utility for my $ but at the same time I'll be playing this primarily solitaire at first.\n\n\n\nhunt for gollum is one of the best solo packs so far, alot of people like conflict at  the carrock\n\nyou may also want to look at the cards you get, as that may influence your decision"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60980-if-i-was-only-able-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=598357","commentId":598357,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1330086174,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nHowlix said:\n\n \n\nIf I was only able to buy the core set and 2 expansions for this game from my local shop which expansions should I get?  I want the most utility for my $ but at the same time I'll be playing this primarily solitaire at first.\n\n \n\n \n\nhunt for gollum is one of the best solo packs so far, alot of people like conflict at  the carrock\n\nyou may also want to look at the cards you get, as that may influence your decision\n\n\n\nLike richsabre mentioned, I would also investigate the player cards included each pack. Is there a sphere you love playing with most? Then get packs that will be good for those spheres. For example, when I had just the core set, I loved Spirit the best. I knew I wanted Hills of Emyn Muill because of all the locations, but card draw was always an issue for me so I knew I wanted the card \"Ancent Mathom\" which is from A Journey to Rhosgobel. So check online for which player cards are in each pack and that might influence the ones you want."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60980-if-i-was-only-able-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=598358","commentId":598358,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1330086239,"content":"forgot to say all current cards can be found on cardgamedb.com"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60980-if-i-was-only-able-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=598493","commentId":598493,"userName":"jrd","timestamp":1330105155,"content":"I recommend Hunt for Gollum but if it was my $$$ I'd skip the adenture packs and save up for Khazad-Dum.
