Similarly, are you allowed to attack them?\n\n \n\nThe question arose while playing today. I assumed that since you were in the middle of player attacks that the newly engaged enemies cannot attack. But I wasn't sure if you were allowed to attack them since technically you are still in the combat phase.\n\n \n\nAnyone know the official ruling on things like this? How have you been playing it?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112027-timing-question-for-combat-in-the-three-trials-stage-3b/?do=findComment&comment=1175615","commentId":1175615,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1406686693,"content":"If you defeat the guardian during your normal window to attack, then you go to the next stage of the quest and get a new guardian engaged with you.  Now YOU can attack IT.  It can't attack you, because enemy attack resolution has already been completed this round, before player attack resolution.  But you are still in the player attack resolution part of the combat phase, so swing away!\n\n \n\nIt's just from the core set manual.  When you advance to the next stage of a quest, nothing about the game state changes.  Just follow instructions on the quest cards and continue the round normally."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112027-timing-question-for-combat-in-the-three-trials-stage-3b/?do=findComment&comment=1179025","commentId":1179025,"userName":"kyrie","timestamp":1406866751,"content":"Thanks for the feedback!

Am I missing something?"}]}
