Beorn is potentially useful, too.\n\nSteward of Gondor is amazing.\n\nFaramir is definitely *very* good- easily in the top three in Leadership.\n\nValiant Sacrifice is cheap card-draw, but I don't think it's at the same level as the other three. Worth including, probably, though.\n\nPuzzled at the list of \"good\" tactics cards- I don't think I agree with *any* of those. The best tactics card to my mind is Horn of Gondor. Blade of Gondolin is quite good *in the tactics deck*, but for everyone else it's worse than say, Celebrian Stone for making progress. Feint is not bad- probably the best Tactics event, but I don't it measures up to the best cards in the other decks. Citadel Plate is worth a mention, expensive though it is, as it allows one to do otherwise impossible things, like survive a Hummerhorns attack. \n\nIn Spirit, Unexpected Courage and Northern Tracker are easily the best two cards. Stand and Fight is good mostly for recurring Gandalf, but it's far worse at this than Sneak Attack. The Galhadrim's Greeting is just much worse than Gandalf.\n\nA lot of Lore cards are quite good, though none as good as the best Leadership or Spirit cards. Daughter of Nimrodel, definitely. I wouldn't include Self-Preservation, as it's worse than Daughter of Nirmodel in almost every way. Forest Snare is also up there. The other one I'd definitely include is Protector of Lorien. Oh, and Henamarth Riversong is absurdly cheap, even if it his ability isn't great.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46940-multi-sphere-decks-top-3-or-4-cards-of-each-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=470815","commentId":470815,"userName":"guest83368","timestamp":1305729649,"content":"Sorry, that i'm asking here, but when i would like to play a solo game with 2 different sphere heroes how many cards should i use minimum for player's deck?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46940-multi-sphere-decks-top-3-or-4-cards-of-each-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=470929","commentId":470929,"userName":"DrNate","timestamp":1305741123,"content":"If you are just playing by yourself, use as many as you want.
