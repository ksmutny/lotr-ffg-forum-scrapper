Historically, mounted warriors often kept multiple horses, either for different purposes (long range riding rather than combat) or as backups for if their primary mount was injured or killed. Of course, you can only ride one at a time, but I don't mind multiple mounts representing a mounted warrior's train."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277264-limit-on-mounts/?do=findComment&comment=3362127","commentId":3362127,"userName":"Boromore","timestamp":1528241557,"content":"Thanks guys! That was the view I ended up on - Glorfindel swapping horses between questing and exploring, etc. I did fall between the \"flavour fail\" view and the horse-hopping stance, but Uruk Chieftain with two mounts is an absolute pig..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277264-limit-on-mounts/?do=findComment&comment=3362788","commentId":3362788,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1528293943,"content":"One foot on each mount, we know Legolas could do it"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277264-limit-on-mounts/?do=findComment&comment=3363220","commentId":3363220,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1528305877,"content":"If there was a Mount limit, we might not have gotten hero Elfhelm."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277264-limit-on-mounts/?do=findComment&comment=3363286","commentId":3363286,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1528308098,"content":"> 38 minutes ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> If there was a Mount limit, we might not have gotten hero Elfhelm.\n\nI don't know why that would matter, Elfhelm's bonus doesn't change if you have multiple mounts on the same character.  No stacking here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277264-limit-on-mounts/?do=findComment&comment=3363768","commentId":3363768,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1528321039,"content":"I know, but it’s fun to stack a bunch of mounts on heroes in an Elfhelm deck, extra boosts or no."}]}
