Committing to an escape test is not the same thing as committing to a quest (see The Dead Marshes rule sheet). So, while participating in an escape test, the Escort will supply 2 willpower but will not be discarded following resolution of the test.\n\nWhen the Escort was first released, a lot of people wondered why it didn't simply have 4 willpower. Apparently, escape tests and other similar mechanics account for this design decision. "}]}
