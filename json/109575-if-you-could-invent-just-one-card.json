This card sound so fun though!! I really hope we get something like this! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nAs for Courageous Sacrifice, I really think Spirit needs something like this showing their loyalty and courage as described in the rule book. This card could be OP especially since you could comfortably take an undefended and then just discard a cheap ally... so it probably does need some more limitations.\n\n \n\nI really like the idea of commanding your army of allies, so giving them all ranged or maybe some temporary defense bonus for a phase would all make for awesome cards.\n\nEdited July 27, 2014 by Catastrophic09"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109575-if-you-could-invent-just-one-card/?do=findComment&comment=1173023","commentId":1173023,"userName":"jormungandr","timestamp":1406549788,"content":"Not really one card, but I would really like quests that are centered around corruption (like the 'betrayal' of Boromir).
