It was not done for game mechanics, so looking for game mechanic explanation, like broken combos, is a dead end.  It's just card theme pure and simple.  It is inconvenient now that we have cards that interact with the signal trait, but at the time it was released, we had none. So there's your explanation. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259345-d%C3%BAnedain-cache-not-a-signal/?do=findComment&comment=2997516","commentId":2997516,"userName":"Jekzer","timestamp":1506373742,"content":"And a good one on that regard, Grandspleen.

So for me the german version has to be renamed as said into \"Ausrüstung der Dunedain\". In the end, it's a very untypical card .. it \"moves\" like the signals but is not one, it grands you ranged but is no weapon. If it was a weapon, than it is the only weapon which can be \"moved\" between heroes and would interact with cards like \"Foe-Hammer\". \nI think the developers try to get a signalstyle-card like Dunedain Signal which provides Ranged instead of Sentinel. \nIf i could redesign this card i would remove the Signal-move-ability and make this card a weapon like the Ranger Bow, which you have to exhaust in order to get Ranged for the end of the phase. Costs 1 and is not restricted."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259345-d%C3%BAnedain-cache-not-a-signal/?do=findComment&comment=3022331","commentId":3022331,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1507818941,"content":"If I could redesign the card I'd just make it a signal."}]}
