Why the second line goes so far if the first line is so short? Both cases could be easily avoided! The text postion seems torn down.\n\n \n\nI did research, and I found out that the whole situation wasn't even called for, it could have been easily texted as printed without any early paragraphs:\n\n \n\nh0LSRXLg6u4.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c628724/v628724009/2fb3e/h0LSRXLg6u4.jpg]\n\n \n\nSee?

It may also be a waste of time for the card designers to keep an eye out for these things all the time in order to make minor tweaks, especially since the text fits on the card just fine."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195860-card-text-placement-sometimes-kills-me/?do=findComment&comment=1939636","commentId":1939636,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1450296068,"content":"Doesn't seems like a waste to me. I work with that kind of stuff as my main job, including visual aesthetics and readability, and I have keen eye for that kind of stuff. It really bugs me, especially when it could have been done right so easily.
