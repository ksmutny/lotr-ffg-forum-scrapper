I totally agree about how well the theme is represented by the card, and also about how difficult it is to make the card work for your deck. I have had some sort of success in the past but it was a great labour to achieve, I basically had to dedicate the entire deck-building to this one mechanic, which in the end does not win you anything. So I abandoned it a long time ago, hoping that one day the card will spring back to action.\n\n \n\nFor me it is obvious. Tactics Boromir is a great thematic card. Core Gandalf too, even the Hobbit version with the raising of the threat when he lingers. Then, hero Denethor, now Galadriel too. I really like Miruvor and the idea beyond Rivendell Minstrel. I wish Master of the Forge had better stats but would only bring weapons and/or items -- I feel that was a big thematic miss."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106033-most-thematic-card/?do=findComment&comment=1081370","commentId":1081370,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1399886392,"content":"too difficult !! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] ...for me I think it is either..hmmm...fatty, because I just love that part of the book, and the art represents it perfectly for me, or ..yes tactics boromir, certainly a real thematic sacrifice\n\n \n\nhaving said that I could sit here for days listing them :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106033-most-thematic-card/?do=findComment&comment=1081490","commentId":1081490,"userName":"ZanzibarLand","timestamp":1399900803,"content":"Beorn ally or Samwise.

It represents all that is Good in Boromir and ultimately helps him to triumph over his base self.\n\nObviously with it's iconic use in his death the card was always likely to involve characters dying (leaving play) - I just think that gaining resources off of it is totally wrong for what the card should have been. It makes no thematic sense.\n\nThe card itself is perfectly valid I just think it should have been called something different - Grave Cairn would have been a better name for this card than it was for it's own effect.\n\n \n\nI hope we get an alternative  horn of Gondor in the future. Still in tactics - personally I think it should have been if attached character leaves play, ready all characters in play. The blowing of the horn warned all of the fellowship of the danger and allowed them to react, but it meant the death of the hornblower."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106033-most-thematic-card/?do=findComment&comment=1083975","commentId":1083975,"userName":"ana4","timestamp":1400047484,"content":"The early cards were often hit or miss. Horn of Gondor is a great example. It is one card that absolutely should have gone to Boromir, no matter what. I could live with \"attach to a Gondor Noble Hero\" but of course they could not have made such a card for the core set. They should have waited just as they did with Asfaloth, for instance. Horn of Gondor appears on about every art of Boromir, it is very, very iconic and symbolic to him. Now, we have only seen multiple versions of characters but I do hope very much we shall see a second version of the Horn of Gondor (which attaches to Boromir only)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106033-most-thematic-card/?do=findComment&comment=1083986","commentId":1083986,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1400048204,"content":"M1628.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/M1628.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106033-most-thematic-card/?do=findComment&comment=1084027","commentId":1084027,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1400050923,"content":"I really like Asfaloth, especially paired with Glorfindel.\n\nHaving tried Galadriel, I must say she is very thematic as well.
