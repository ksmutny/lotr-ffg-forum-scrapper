What House rules are you suggesting?\n\n \n\nA house rule is just some made up rules that you do to make the game more fun for your own private circle of friends and family and solo games. A lot of players make house rules in this game as solo play as it is so unballenced. As Rich said this quest is super frustrating.. so you can just never pay it like him, or you can play it a few times and then after you know what the quest is about make a small changes to the rules to make it more fun.\n\nExamples of house rules that are fairly common that I have tried and think are fun for solo...\n\n * A Journey To Rhosgobel - Start with no damage on Eagle and/or add 1 wound per round instead of 2.\n * Return to Mirkwood - Raise threat by 1 or 2 instead of 3 per round and/or make threat dropping location effect first player.\n * Play with 2 decks - any quest\n\nSome common ones i think suck and do not recommend.. but hey make up your own mind...\n\n * no resource matching to cast spells\n * Play with 4 heroes\n * Allow actions to happen at response speed\n\nThe point is that this is YOUR game, and you can do what you like with it.. the idea is to have fun.. not bash your head in rage at the quests.. If a quest is simply not fun.. try modding the rules a bit... though it is a good idea to fail a lot first so you have a well rounded idea of what the quest is about.\n\nProxies are when you say \"this card is in fact this other card I do not own\" So say you want to play with 3 UCs but can ont be stuffed buying 3 core sets... you can just say that \"Keen Eyed Took\" is in fact \"Unexpected Courage\" if you use sleeves you can also simply print out the card images and slide it in the front of your sleeve over the other art work so it looks better.\n\nProxy'n is very common and everyone dose it in CCGs as it is so hard to get the cards in that format... not so common in LCGs as far as I have seen, but it is a good way to test and see if you want to buy a pack or not (besides the quest) as you can build a deck with proxies and test them out. Most people use it to get 3 of the core sets with out buying them"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59953-trapped-in-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=589182","commentId":589182,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1328223611,"content":" Still haven't tried it, but I'm glad to see you've taken me up on the suggestion.

This way, at least, you're ensured that you'll be able to play your cards. But even then, you'll find this scenario very harsh solo.\n\nIt takes a proper alignment of objective guardian cards (you want a couple treachery if possible; forget the quest if you get 2 Dol Guldur Beastmasters along with Ungoliant's Spawn), the right hero being kidnapped (especially when playing multi-color) and a couple of early turn where the encounter deck gives you a break.\n\nSneak Attack + Gandalf is a must to progress in this quest. Any form of resource acceleration is also welcome (Steward of Gondor, Gloin, Zigil Miner).\n\nAnyway, give it a few tries. You'll get a feel for the quest, but don't be discouraged if you barely get 10 % win rate.
