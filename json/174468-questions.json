Yes, you can do whatever you would normally be able to do with a character that phase when you sneak attack them in.\n\n2. No, because you didn't travel there, you start out there. If you travel there, you have to raise your pursuit value.\n\n3. You would still draw your opening hand, because that occurs before following instructions on the setup card. You still raise your threat at the end of each turn as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174468-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1597444","commentId":1597444,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1430242089,"content":"I think you have to assign damage from Archery before you have an action window-- so you would have to do the Archery before Hama is able to enter play via Sneak Attack.  At work presently and can't double check all the rules inserts.   Compare the Archery explanation (Heirs of Numenor rules insert or also in Treason of Saruman, I think) for its timing, against the list of action windows in the back of the Core manual and you'll have your answer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174468-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1597471","commentId":1597471,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1430242936,"content":"Ohh yeah nevermind. Archery is assigned before you ever have a chance to do anything that phase. Says \"beginning\" so that's before your first action window. Sorry."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174468-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1597831","commentId":1597831,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1430258355,"content":"I think it could be debatable. IIRC the list of action windows just says there's no action window while shadow cards are being dealt and actions can be taken freely after that. So you deal out shadow cards at the beginning of the combat phase and can't take actions, then you assign archery, still the beginning of the phase but you're past shadow cards so you can take actions freely and could sneak a character in during archery.\n\nI mean, it's certainly questionable, but given the intricacies of action windows, if the designers don't want things like this to happen they should specify whether or not there's an action window while each new mechanic is being resolved.\n\nEdited April 28, 2015 by PocketWraith"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174468-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1598152","commentId":1598152,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1430279056,"content":"Archery happens at the beginning though, before shadow cards are dealt and before any player actions are available. It's not optional or a player decision to wait and assign the damage after shadow cards are dealt, it happens too early.\n\nEdited April 29, 2015 by Chris51261"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174468-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1598163","commentId":1598163,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1430279568,"content":"Now that I am at home, I can look at the rules myself, and it's pretty clear that you could not do a Sneak Attack and then assign Archery damage to that character.  You have to resolve the Archery damage first.\n\n \n\nArchery is done at the \"beginning of the combat phase,\" which is the same timing given for dealing out shadow cards:\n\n \n\n\"While a card with the archery keyword is in play, players must deal damage to character cards in play equal to the specified archery value at the beginning of each combat phase.\" (Heirs of Numenor rules)\n\n \n\n\"At the beginning of the combat phase, the players deal 1 shadow card to each engaged enemy.\" (Core set manual)\n\n \n\nThere is no action window until after shadow cards have been dealt. You have to complete the dealing of shadow cards and Archery damage resolution before you get to that action window so alas, no meat shield with Sneak Attack can enter play until you're done with Archery."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174468-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1598641","commentId":1598641,"userName":"Veve7","timestamp":1430318435,"content":"Thank you again!"}]}
