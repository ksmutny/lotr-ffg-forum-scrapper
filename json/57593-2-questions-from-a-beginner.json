(and i know he only stays in play for 1 phase)\n\n2) can an attachment be attached to a character of a different sphere of influence even though i paid for it with the correct sphere of influence (for example if I used gimli's pool to pay for dwarven axe, can i attach it to aragorn?\n \n\nthanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57593-2-questions-from-a-beginner/?do=findComment&comment=567614","commentId":567614,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1323882964,"content":" Yes to both questions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57593-2-questions-from-a-beginner/?do=findComment&comment=567833","commentId":567833,"userName":"Beast Rabban","timestamp":1323937882,"content":" An attachment or event card will say in its text if it has any restrictions on whom it can be played eg hero only or sphere X only.

So the general rule is unless it says a restriction on the card then there aren't any.\n\n\n\nAn example of this would be \"A Burning Brand\" which can only be attached to a Lore character. The workaround for this is to play Song of Wisdom (only on heroes though) which gives the attached hero a Lore resource icon, thus making the hero belong to the Lore sphere and therefore elligible to have A burning Brand attached."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57593-2-questions-from-a-beginner/?do=findComment&comment=568636","commentId":568636,"userName":"gkelf","timestamp":1324116834,"content":" Oh ok thanks for the clarification. When playing 2 player, can you attach one of your attachment cards to your teammate's character?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57593-2-questions-from-a-beginner/?do=findComment&comment=568675","commentId":568675,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1324122845,"content":"Yes, you can attach to any eligible character, regardless of owner. "}]}
