What I'm wondering is which is better insofar as player cards and/or the quests between The Sands of Harad and The Wilds of Rhovanion? I like thematic decks and quests and play mostly in multiplayer.

The quests are great so far, too!\n\nSo if you don't need a ton of quests right now, I'd suggest Rhovanion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284564-harad-or-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3503895","commentId":3503895,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1539611729,"content":"The Haradrim cycle gives support to already-established deck types and is completed and available\n\nThe Ered Mithrin cycle introduces quite a few new deck types and is mid-release.\n\nBoth have pros and cons.

There was always going to be more canon to work with than in Harad, but the choice to have a powerful, ready-made Dale deck in the deluxe box (and a Woodman archetype on the way) really doubled down on the theme. Add to that Thranduil and Grimbeorn heroes, the nostalgic revisiting of the Core Set, and the chance to fight dragons instead of more spiders, wargs and orcs in Harad (yawn) and Rhovanian's basically hitting all the spots that I felt Sands of Harad missed. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284564-harad-or-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3506567","commentId":3506567,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1539789746,"content":"The Harrad are great and powerful, but in multiplayer (they are still good) but fall a bit off.
