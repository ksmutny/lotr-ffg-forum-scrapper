Just use a sheet and a pencil to keep count of threat of the 2 players.\n\n \n\nThere are severall reasons to buy a second core set and even a tird. One is the fact that some of the most powerful cards in the Core set have only 1 or 2 copies (ex: Steward of Gondor (2), Unexpected Courage (1), Sneak Attack (2), etc)\n\n \n\nWith one core set you do not have enough card pool to build 2 tactics deck. Even with all the expansions and adventure packs it can be difficult to build them strong."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71561-number-of-players/?do=findComment&comment=699012","commentId":699012,"userName":"Nyarlathotep5150","timestamp":1348419946,"content":"     Thanks, I was wondering because I usually have about 3 players and an extra $40 is a lot to pay if all I needed was more threat trackers (since I can just use dice)."}]}
