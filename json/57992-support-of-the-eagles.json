So imo, yes.. you can play this on any eagle exhausted or not.\n\nNerdmeister said:\n\n2) If an eagle dies before the end of the phase (shadow card or planned suicide defense) does it still give it´s bonus or does the bonus stop the moment the eagle dies?\n\nNo. Again, you pay the cost and get the result... your not attaching, there is nothing \"linking\" these cards. So, IMO, no..\n\n \n\nAnd answer to your next question? YES this card is frickn powerful as ****"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57992-support-of-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=571107","commentId":571107,"userName":"Beast Rabban","timestamp":1324755875,"content":"Nerdmeister said:\n\nHmm this one boggles the mind a bit.

Ready, exhausted makes no difference you are just looking at its defence or attack value.\n\n2) SoE adds the attack or defence of the eagle at the time it is exhausted. Whatever happens to the eagle after that is irrelevant. So if you exhaust SoE to add winged guardians defence to a hero then use winged guardian to defend and disguard him because you couldn't pay the resource to keep him the hero still gets his defence bonus until the end of the round.\n\nThe card is quite powerful but it takes a bit to get it running. This card is insane with Eagles of the Misty Mountains. I had two of the SoE on Boromir and a boosted EoMM in play. Boromir was swinging for 19 attack. The Eagle deck is definitely a viable option for those enemy heavy quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57992-support-of-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=571120","commentId":571120,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1324760310,"content":"Thanks for the answers.

I have certainly played it that way. Eagles of the Misty Mountains, a couple of facedown attachments, add that to a hero and you have an instant tank. And if you can refresh that hero, then, you can hit more than one enemy with it. And I agree, this is one powerful card."}]}
