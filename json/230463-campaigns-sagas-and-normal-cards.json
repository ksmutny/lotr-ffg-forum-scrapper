(Thanks Btw!).. the Normal blocks and Deluxe are one set of campaign, and then the sagas are a second set of campaigns?  My wife really digs playing campaign mode, so that's cool.  And if that's the case, awesome!  That's what I was hoping how the sagas played, but it wasn't super clear on the product page."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230463-campaigns-sagas-and-normal-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2421955","commentId":2421955,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1474336646,"content":"Sort of yes -- the Sagas are a cohesive campaign with campaign rules and everything.\n\n \n\nThe adventure packs + deluxe expansions (We call these 'cycles') form a continuous storyline but there is no formal campaign ruleset.  You can skip an AP if you want, you'll miss some story, but there is no rule preventing you from doing it.\n\n \n\nThe cycles started getting real story by the time of the 3rd cycle (Heirs of Numenor + Against the Shadow adventure packs).  The first two cycles (Core set + Mirkwood and Khazad-dum + Dwarrowdelf) did not have much in the way of story, just a few lines on the quest cards and maybe a paragraph? in the rules insert.  \n\n \n\nSince that 3rd cycle however, they have written the story as if one group of heroes has continuously completed all of the scenarios."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230463-campaigns-sagas-and-normal-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2421958","commentId":2421958,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1474336696,"content":"The Saga scenarios all fall in the moderate to hard range of the difficulty scale, while the scenarios in the cycles vary a lot more."}]}
