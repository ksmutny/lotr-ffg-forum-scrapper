Am I correct that I have to currently control Bilbo to be able to play The Lucky Number? Burglar Baggins specifies that anyone can activate the cost from Bilbo's pool no matter who currently controls him, but The Lucky Number doesn't have that text.\n\nDoes this basically make The Lucky Number useless, or at least highly specialized, in multiplayer situations?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93213-the-lucky-number/?do=findComment&comment=904702","commentId":904702,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1383907394,"content":"Somewhere, probably the rulebook of the hobbit box, or directly on Bilbo ? it is written that everybody can use bilbo's ressource to play bilbo's sphere cards.\n\nCan someone confirm ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93213-the-lucky-number/?do=findComment&comment=904793","commentId":904793,"userName":"Kassad","timestamp":1383921178,"content":"> Somewhere, probably the rulebook of the hobbit box, or directly on Bilbo ? it is written that everybody can use bilbo's ressource to play bilbo's sphere cards.\n> \n> Can someone confirm ?\n\nI read the rulebook in both Hobbit expansions, Bilbo's card and the FAQ and didn't find it.  I would love confirmation as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93213-the-lucky-number/?do=findComment&comment=904807","commentId":904807,"userName":"Kassad","timestamp":1383922482,"content":"The reason I ask is because Burglar Baggins very specifically mentions that anyone can use Bilbo's resources to play it and The Lucky Number does not.  In addition, The Lucky Number was printed after Burglar Baggins so it is more doubtful that they simply forgot to put the text on the card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93213-the-lucky-number/?do=findComment&comment=905201","commentId":905201,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1383990044,"content":"Oh, so it was on Burglar Baggins...\n\nso that means lucky number doesn't work the same.
