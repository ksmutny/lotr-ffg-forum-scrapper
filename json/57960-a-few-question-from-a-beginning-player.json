You play the second card when the Beastmaster attacks, so you're correct (not that it really matters).\n\n3. In this case you don't have to remove them from locations. Say you have 2 tokens on a location and none on your quest and you get the Misty Mountain Goblins as a shadow card, nothing would happen. It's also in the FAQ:\n\n(1.05) Removing Progress Tokens from Quests\nWhen a card effect removes progress tokens from a\nquest or quest card, the effect applies specifically to the\nquest card, and never to the active location.\n\n \n\nAbout your question regarding guarded attachments, I let the guarding cards stay in play. Again, this is handled in the FAQ:\n\n(1.17) Unclaimed Objectives\nAn unclaimed objective is one that is not currently\nclaimed and under the control of a player. An\nunclaimed objective can be guarded or unguarded.\nA guarded objective is treated like an attachment if\nguarded by an enemy or location, and remains attached\nto that card until it leaves play, at which point it will\nreturn to the staging area. Any unclaimed objective\nin the staging area that is not attached to a card is\nconsidered to be unguarded. If an objective is claimed\nat one point, and then returns to the staging area, it\nregains the status of unclaimed.\n\n \n\nSo the objective card is attached to the guard, and not the other way around. In your examp,e the guard would simply loose its attachment."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57960-a-few-question-from-a-beginning-player/?do=findComment&comment=572587","commentId":572587,"userName":"fuelstaind","timestamp":1325196689,"content":"Here's a couple questions I have.\n\n1.

If you mentally put a small break between these 3 things and look at it as 3 separate actions, you are not allowed to choose. I have no clue which is the case, we are still in need of a detailed a timing schedule for this game.

The 'resolving attacks against you' part of the phase is green which according to the chart key means \"you can take actions generally, or between the game steps stated in the rules\".  And then if you go to page 18 in the rulebook for the Combat Phase stuff, and under 'Resolving Enemy Attacks' it says \"When resolving enemy attacks, the players follow these 4 steps, in order. Players may play event cards and take actions at the end of each step\". The four steps it then lists are: 1. Choose an enemy 2. Declare a defender 3. Resolve shadow effect 4. Determine combat damage.\n\nOf which you can play event cards and take actions at the end of each one. So there's actually quite a few places you can use Unexpected Courage and Behind Strong Walls during this part of the Combat Phase.\n\nI think the chart just kind of needs redone because they don't show all of the steps of combat written out, the color code is sometimes missed, and they use the phrase 'step' confusingly in the chart description."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57960-a-few-question-from-a-beginning-player/?do=findComment&comment=740128","commentId":740128,"userName":"Serazu","timestamp":1356775138,"content":"Right, right.
