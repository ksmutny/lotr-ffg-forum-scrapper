The shadow card will be discarded with the defeated enemy.\n\n2. Dealing shadow cards is the first thing you do during the combat phase.  Players have the opportunity to use actions before the first player starts resolving enemy attacks, and this is normally when I play the card.  There are many chances during the combat phase to use actions, and the only requirement has been that Feint must be played before and enemy is chosen to resolve their attack.  In the case of using feint, the shadow card dealt to the Feinted enemy is discarded at the end of the combat phase.\n\n3. The rules state on page 16, \"Whether an enemy is engaged through an engagement check, through a card effect, or through a player’s choice, the end result is the same, with the enemy and the player engaging one another. In all cases, the player is considered to have engaged the enemy and the enemy is considered to have engaged the player.\"\n\n4. The quest card says to \"add it to the staging area\" therefore it is not revealed.  Thalin's ability won't work on it, but likewise the When Revealed effect isn't triggered either."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51345-some-questions-about-shadow-cards-and-other-rules/?do=findComment&comment=513001","commentId":513001,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1313065638,"content":"Going to toss in a question here instead of starting a new thread.\n\nRegarding the Despair card's shadow effect that nullifies the defending character's defense, is that just the character card's printed defense?

I hate Despair even more.
