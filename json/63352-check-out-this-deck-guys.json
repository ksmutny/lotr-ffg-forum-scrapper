I play a similar deck with Denethor replacing Bifur - thus it is much less thematic than yours.\n\nNow for a few suggestion if you do not mind. The one card I would recommend in any deck with Frodo, much more with Bilbo also, is Good Meal. The potential to lower the cost of events is invaluable. And if you play Songs, it will be even more versatile. The Galadhrim's Greeting on round 1 with only 1 Spirit hero is huge.\n\nFurthermore, it might not be hard to move into secrecy with such a deck. Basically you just need the Galadhrim's early. And then you can play the upcoming Resourceful for cheap. Using a proxy, I have been playing the card for about two weeks now in a similar deck and if you get it early, it dramatically changes the game to your benefit.\n\nAnd/or, since you play Lore-major, Spirit-miner, would it not be useful to add Zigil Miner to the deck? It would fit the theme and Gildor is already there to cooperate. The Miner can be of use even without the ability.\n\nI totally agree about Mirkwood Runner, in such a deck that takes time to build and is light on attacking strength, Runner is a great card to have.\n\nCheers.\n\nps: After looking little longer as to what cards to remove in order to incorporate the suggestions I see two easy swaps: Zigil Miner for the other Miner and Good Meal for Boots. The latter seems obvious. While it is good to have the utility to help preventing Bilbo from getting killed, Frodo can already do the job. And since you already run Hammersmith, he shall help you recycle the food."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63352-check-out-this-deck-guys/?do=findComment&comment=620030","commentId":620030,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1334909589,"content":"scottindeed said:\n\n Good for you for sticking to a theme.  I do this with all my decks now.  I'm currently running 2 player decks with all six Dwarf heroes and as many Dwarf themed cards as I can.  It's going great!\n\n\n\nThis is one aspect I really love about the game, theme goes well with strategy. Thus the Bilbo and Boromir type of player can live in symbiosis.
