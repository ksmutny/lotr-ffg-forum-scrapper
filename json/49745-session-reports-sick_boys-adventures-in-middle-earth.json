Too long has it been since I walked under the Malorn's boughts. Rest assured we shall proceed promptly.\"\n\nKing Thranduil: \"So be it, Dunedain. I'm counting on you and your companions to deliver this letter to Lady Galadriel herself as quickly as possible. I'm taking leave now; Dancing with the Stars is on tonight.\"\n\nAragorn: \"All right fellows! Let's go!\"\n\nDunhere: \"Huh... don't you think we should look at our equipment before leaving? Maybe take a few guards along with us? After all, this is the Mirkwood forest we're talking about.\"\n\nAragorn: \"Pfew... I know these woods like my own house. It'll be a piece of cake. Come on darling (grabing Eowyn by the hand), I'll show you some adventure along the way.\"\n\nDunhere: \"Yeah, but I thought you were homeless... and there might be spiders and orcs on the way... Hey guys, wait for me!\"\n\nRushing outside the elf king's palace, Dunhere barely caught up with Aragorn and Eowyn as they were taking a left turn along a little used trail.\n\nAragorn: \"This way. I know this Old Forest Road. I don't know why, but I always feel refreshed walking along this path. It should take us toward the mountains further inside the forest very soon. Dunhere, try to relax man! Eowyn will scout ahead if it may help you feel safer!\"\n\nDunhere: \"No need for her to go far! Spiders are already on us!\"\n\nAragorn, turning around: \"What? Ouch!\". The ranger's parry wasn't fast enough and the Forest Spider dropped on his back, biting his shoulder. Dunhere immediately striked at the monster, forcing it to retreat in the underbrush.\n\nDunhere: \"Will you believe me now? That creature won't leave us alone for sure. Who knows when it'll come back! I'll take the first watch tonight.\"\n\nEowyn: \"Did I miss anything boys? Oh, dear! Are you bleeding?\"\n\nArgagorn: \"Nah... just a scratch.\"\n\nDunhere spent most of the night jumping at the mearest sound and noise coming from the surrounding woods. With the light of dawn starting to show amongst the trees, he heard whistling further down the path. To his surprise, a jolly hobbit appeared around a bend in the road. Seeing the nervous warrior, he started laughing!\n\nWandering Took: \"What's wrong with you? Have you been attacked by a spider or what?\" Aragorn and Eowyn awoke at the noise. \"By the way, were you just about to have breakfast? Mind if I join you?\", added the hobbit.\n\nAragorn: \"See Dunhere. You wanted companions; fate is serving you one!\"\n\nDunhere: \"Looks to me like I'm the one that'll have to serve him... and probably more than one helping, if what I heard of the halflings is true. Still, it's better to have a small companion than no companion at all! But you want to be careful around here, Took: there are spiders in those woods.\"\n\nThey started ascending the mountains later that day, leaving the road behind them.\n\nAragorn: \"Unless I'm mistaken, we should come through the Necromancer's Pass if we keep going toward those peaks. It's a dangerous area where the air is stiffling and discouraging. But it's a shortcut to get through the woods and we'll soon be out of it.\"\n\nDunhere, murmuring: \"If the spiders don't catch up with us...\"\n\nAragorn: \"We only saw one! Stop being so negative about this trip! Look at Eowyn instead! She's plowing along and moving forward without complain.\"\n\nWandering Took: \"My cousin went through this pass once. He says it's full of orcs, nasty warriors and beastmasters.\"\n\nAragorn: \"Nonsense! If it was so dangerous, how come your cousin came out of it? I've had enough of this dark mood. Let's sing some happy songs and show some sp...\"\n\nDunhere, interrupting: \"SPIDER!!!\"\n\nThis time, Aragorn had time to react and he dived aside as a huge Forest Spider tried to drop on him again. The Took wasn't so fast, however, and he took a bite in the middle of the stomach before Dunhere could repel the monster with his sword. While Aragorn was standing up, a second spider bounced on him out of the bushes. He quickly brushed it aside (it was much smaller than the first one), but felt a tug around his neck as the creature was already fleeing on the other side of the road.\n\nAragorn: \"My stone! Help! It took my stone!\"\n\nWandering Took: \"Yeah, and it almost took my arm. Give us a break. By the way, thanks Dunhere.\"\n\nDunhere: \"Don't thank me yet. It'll be back. That's the same spider we met yesterday. It was still bearing the mark of my sword on its hind leg. I'm sure it followed us all day, waiting for the right time to attack. These woods are so unnatural... What wouldn't I give to be back on the plains of Rohan instead!\"\n\nAll day long and during the next, they kept making progress and climbing along the mountainous slopes under the shadow of the woods. An hour after lunch, they happened upon a sorry sign. A man was laying flat on his back, bearing the uniform of the citadel guards of Gondor.\n\nDunhere: \"So far from the White Tower he is. What may have lead him here? And how did he die? He doesn't seem to have any injury.\"\n\nAragorn bent over the stranger, hoping to confirm whether he was effectively dead or not. As soon as he reached with his hand, a black arrow fell from the sky and struck him in the right shoulder. Three orcs were running down the path from the mountain, howling with glee and brandishing long scimitars. Dunhere went ahead to meet them, but the leading orc, a huge creature standing at least a foot taller than the Rohirrim, dove under his strike and pushed him in the ditch beside the path. The following orc took a swipe at him. Dunhere rolled further away and sustained only a slash to his leg rather than being skewered on the rusty blade.\n\nBefore Aragorn could draw his own blade, another foe came at him: the Forest Spider chose this moment to drop from the trees. The ranger managed to parry its attack (the spider moved much slower, probably still injured from Dunhere's attack the day before), but he felt a shadow pass across his eyes. For a moment, he was certain the monster was more than a simple spider: some horrible creature from beyond time, maybe.\n\nAlerted by the noise, Eowyn and the Took came running back from their exploration of the surrounding area. Eowyn intoned a warrior's chant and at the sound of her voice, the orcs froze. Unseen by all, the \"dead\" guard also opened his eyes. He saw the spider trying to overwhelm the ranger next to him and reached out for his spear. He stabbed at the monster's belly, forcing his weapon deep inside the bulbous creature's body. The spider emitted a high pitched scream. Dunhere took the opportunity to stand up and racing toward his companions, he finished the spider with a mighty sword swipe. They all turned around toward the orcs, who were coming out of their daze. Seeing the odds turning against them, they chose to retreat. Aragorn went to pursue them, but Eowyn held him back.\n\nEowyn: \"Let them go for now. They won't surprise us another time, and you need to see to your injury. Also, I want to know who our new companion is\".\n\nAragorn was able to bandage his shoulder after taking out the arrow. He would have to use his left hand to hold his sword for a few days. As for the guard, he had absolutely no idea what happened to him.\n\nGuard of the Citadel: \"We were supposed to deliver a message to the elf king, me and my two companions. But we got lost in the woods and when we came in view of this moutain pass, the sun seemed to disappear and I fell into darkness. I only remember dark dreams until your clear voice pierced through the haze. 'Stand and fight', I heard you say from within my nightmare. Thank you again, milady. I shall repay my debt by escorting you along your way.\"\n\nWhen they made camp, Aragorn got some Athelas leaves to boil over the fire. A sweet fragrance surrounded them and even Dunhere felt calmer than he had for days. Having got rid of the spider and finding courage in their number, he stayed awake long into the night, discussing with Eowyn of their upcoming approach of the pass at the top of the mountain, which they expected to reach the next day. Aragorn fell in a daze and had a strange dream: in it, he met an escort of elves from the Golden Wood. They didn't say anything, simply marching and passing along, saluting him. However, when he awoke, he felt refreshed and more aware of his surroundings.\n\nThey reached the top of the mountain as planned early during the day. They had a good view of the surrounding lands, gathering a number of strategic information on their situation. Before plunging into the pass, they discussed their plans for the next steps of their quest. A low buzzing sound could be heard from beyond the pass, but they couldn't determine what it was.\n\nAs they entered the pass, Aragorn brought them all to a halt.\n\nAragorn: \"Look! Orc trail. Looks like we've caught up with our three 'friends' from yesterday. Follow me, we'll try to surprise them this time.\"\n\nThe ranger didn't have any trouble tracking the orcs. Soon enough, their heard the grunts and snarls that made up the orc speech coming from behind a small hill.\n\nAragorn: \"I'll meet them from this side, try to get at them from the other way and we'll flank them. They won't stand a chance!\"\n\nHe kept walking and arrived upon the three creatures who were arguing over some blackened piece of meat. They spotted the ranger as soon as he came into view and immediately jumped toward him, snarling and drawing their blades. He had a hard time parying their attacks, but they were clumsy and more often than not, they stood in each other's way. Dunhere and the Took had finally made it along the other side of the mountainous ridge and were coming to their companion's help. The orcs never heard them coming and quickly fell down to Dunhere's arrows and the hobbit's short sword.\n\nThey made their way across the Necromancer's Pass and were out of it, going down on the other side of the mountain and reentering the denser part of the woods before the end of the afternoon. The poor guard from Gondor had a moment of panic in the evening when a cloud of bats surrounded them, but Dunhere dispersed them quickly enough with the help of the Took.\n\nOn the morning of the next day, while they were eating breakfast, a man showed up, coming down from the pass.\n\nAragorn: \"Roger! What are you doing here?\"\n\nRoger the Northern Tracker: \"I had to find you. Wasn't easy, I arrived at the palace two days after you'd gone. I'm bringing sad news from Gondor, sir. The steward has passed away. I've been told the mantle of stewardship now rest on your shoulders.\"\n\nAragorn: \"Well, so long as the increased salary, why not! And you'll be coming with us, I hope? We're on our way to Lorien.\"\n\nThe company left soon after. The day was uneventful, but they kept feeling a presence, as if Eyes were constantly watching them from the woods. With the clouds gathering over them, it was almost as dark as twilight by the middle of the day. The buzzing sound they'd started to hear a few days ago kept pestering them, but they never saw the source.\n\nAt one point, Aragorn had them all stop.\n\nAragorn: \"See those tracks. Another orc. Looks like it may be accompanied by some beast, a wolf or other. We want to be careful.\"\n\nDunhere: \"That's a first. Not that I'll complain. I'll keep my bow ready. If we spot it, it won't stand a chance.\"\n\nThey did spot it later on, but Dunhere barely got time to shoot at it that it left in a hurry. They didn't press after the creature, confident that they'd catch up with it sooner or later.\n\nThey started to make good progress through the woods now that the company was getting along and finding its pace.\n\nGandalf: \"Well met, friends!\"\n\nAragorn: \"Gandalf! Always where you're the least expected. And, as usual, your presence is welcome. Hopefuly, you'll stay with us for a while.\"\n\nGandalf: \"Well, you know how it is. I show up, take care of some threat, and then I leave without trace.\"\n\nDunhere: \"Still, even if only temporary, your presence is more than welcome amongst us. By the way, who's your companion?\"\n\nGandalf: \"Never travel without an archer! Straight from the Silverlode to your company. I decided to bring you reinforcement. I figured you may need it before you exit the woods.\"\n\nEowyn: \"Welcome aboard, archer!\"\n\nWith Gandalf walking amongst them, they quickly went ahead with their quest. They fell into another orc ambush (the foolish monsters attacked Gandalf, as if their weapons could seriously injure him), but Roger the Northern Tracker defended the group from the orcs and Aragorn dispatched them, repaying them for all his misfortunes since leaving the palace.\n\n\"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ-Tchak\"\n\nAragorn: \"Dude! What did you do that for?\"\n\nDunhere: \"Didn't you see them? Hummerhorns. I shot them before they could get any closer. The legend says that no single hero in the world can survive their sting. Why take the chance?\"\n\nWhile the two warriors were arguing, Gandalf left as quietly as he had appeared, leaving the Silverlode Archer to complete the quest with the company.\n\nTom the Silverlode Archer: \"By the way, we should be meeting my brother Tim later on. He was to wait for us near the fork in the road.\"\n\nTim effectively joined them and took part in a little skirmish they had with a patrol of orcs. Aragorn sustained another injury while fending off the monster's attacks. The proud ranger was starting to feel the pain and he walked with a limp the rest of the way.\n\nDunhere: \"I told you we should have made better preparation. I think you should leave the fighting to some of our companions until you feel better. We don't want lose you for ever. And by the way, while you were dealing with that patrol, that Dol Guldur Beastmaster we saw two days ago tried to sneak up on us, but I made it flee again. It won't survive another encounter, if I judge by the amount of blood left behind.\"\n\nThey finaly reached the Fork in the Road.\n\nDunhere: \"Well, where do we go now? I'm sure one of these paths leads to unnamable dangers, but which one?\"\n\nLorien Guide: \"Allow me to help you, sir.\"\n\nDunhere: \"Who the hell are you?\"\n\nLorien Guide: \"A guide. You're trying to find your way, I may help you.\"\n\nDunhere: \"Cool then. So, which way?\"\n\nLorien Guide: \"I recommend going along the left side. It's the path that leads toward Beorn's home. The path is long, but smooth and well cleared. The only problem is the huge orc chieftain who guards the road a few miles from here.\"\n\nDunhere: \"We've killed our share of orcs already. One more won't be a problem. Let's go!\"\n\nEffectively, after an hour of walking along the path, they saw a huge orc, at least seven feet tall and holding a wicked looking axe in his hands, barring the way.\n\nChieftan Ufthak: \"You shall not pass!\"\n\nRoger the Norther Tracker: \"Hello, sir. Will you accept a challenge? If you kill me, my friends will turn back and not bother you. If I manage to dispatch you, well, you won't care about whether we pass or not, will you?\"\n\nChieftan Ufthak: \"Whahaha! You don't stand a chance. En garde!\"\n\nThe orc started circling around with the tracker, the fighters exchanging blows and studying each other. The tracker got injured and was beginning to lose ground against his massive opponent.\n\nAragorn: \"Guys, screw this challenge. FIRE!\"\n\nHe threw is dagger at the orc while the two archers and Dunhere shot it down. Never understanding what happened, the chieftain fell down in a widening pool of blood.\n\nDuring the lunch break, Aragorn searched amongst his backpack and uttered a cry of surprise: \"My stone! I thought it was lost!\"\n\nDunhere: \"I bet you had it there all along.\"\n\nAragorn: \"No, I swear the shadow spider took it.\"\n\nDunhere: \"Well, how could that be. I thought this jewel was unique.\"\n\nThey let this mistery be and kept advancing along the path, Aragorn leading the way with the green stone shining proudly around his neck.\n\nSuddenly, out of nowhere, lighting fell out of the sky. Aragorn was miraculously spared, but Eowyn, Roger, the guide and the guard all sustained injuries. The poor Northern Tracker was barely able to stand up.\n\nRoger the Northern Tracker: \"Guys, I think I'll take it easy for a few hours. I'll leave the exploration to you until I feel strength coming back to my legs.\"\n\nAragorn: \"What the heck just happened?\"\n\nEowyn: \"The Necromancer. He must have been angered at our disruption of his pass earlier. His arm is long and can reach far.\"\n\nThey came across the dead body of the Dol Guldur Beastmaster not far from there.\n\nDunhere: \"Oh yeah, forgot to tell you. I finally killed it. Dumb bastard kept staying away, maybe thinking we were not seeing it coming. Well I was.\"\n\nAragorn: \"Finally! Hey everyone, see the gate over there? That's the end of our quest and the end of those **** woods!\"\n\nEveryone: \"HOORAY!\"\n\nNow for the technical report:\n\nDecklist (built from 3 Core Sets)\n\nHeroes\n\n * Aragorn\n * Eowyn\n * Dunhere\n\nAllies - Leadership\n\n * 3 x Faramir\n * 1 x Guard of the Citadel\n * 2 x Silverlode Archer\n\nAttachments - Leadership\n\n * 3 x Celebrian's Stone\n * 3 x Steward of Gondor\n\nEvents - Leadership\n\n * 2 x Ever Vigilant\n * 2 x Grim Resolve\n * 3 x Sneak Attack\n * 1 x Valiant Sacrifice\n\nAllies - Spirit\n\n * 3 x Lorien Guide\n * 3 x Northern Tracker\n * 3 x Wandering Took\n\nAttachments - Spirit\n\n * 3 x Unexpected Courage\n\nEvents - Spirit\n\n * 3 x A Test of Will\n * 2 x Dwarven Tomb\n * 1 x Fortune or Fate\n * 3 x Hasty Stroke\n * 3 x Stand and Fight\n * 3 x The Galadhrim's Greetings\n\nNeutral - Allies\n\n * 3 x Gandalf\n\nStarting hand: Guard of the Citadel, Celebrian's Stone, Grim Resolve, Fortune or Fate, Stand and Fight, The Galadhrim's Greetings\n\nNo mulligan.\n\nStaging area contains Old Forest Road and Forest Spider.

I was afraid it would be too subtle.\n\nObviously, I went ahead with an arrogant / foolish Aragorn personality and made Dunhere the more heroic member of the trio. There's no point in trying to tie those stories too much with \"canon\" lore. Instead, I tried to make fun / use it as much as I could while having the characters reflect on the game mechanic from an \"in world\" perspective (such as the Hummerhorns comment).\n\nI think my main idea for Aragorn's attitude started with my decision not to take a mulligan. This hand was bad; I had no good play to make and should have taken a mulligan. Anything else would have been at leastÂ just as good and almost certainly better. When I play this deck, I always consider Aragorn to be my primary hero (he gets Steward of Gondor, he gets Unexpected Courage, he's part of questing and fighting, etc.). Thus I decided he was the one that chose not to take a mulligan, making this quest much harder than it should be (I usualy get through it in less than seven turns). It did end up being the driving point of my storytelling.\n\nBy the way, if anyone has a better format / structure to suggest for the technical part of the report (I used a single paragraph per round, breaking down phases by a . and using ; to separate actions within a given phase, I'd like to hear it. I guess I could further break it down in paragraph, but the post is already almost a full page long so..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49745-session-reports-sick_boys-adventures-in-middle-earth/?do=findComment&comment=497968","commentId":497968,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1310371057,"content":"Nice report, good to have both the technical and fancy version.

Am I at the right place to sign up?\"\n\nGimli: \"You certainly are, milady. We'll take you from here to the Argonath for a modest fee, allowing you to enjoy the pleasures of fast-paced rafting experience in total safety with my collegue and myself taking place aboard your raft. And for a little extra, we can arrange transportation back here via an overnight caravan.\"\n\nEowyn: \"Wonderful! Where do I sign?

Don't you see we have a paying customer here?\"\n\nEowyn, murmuring to Thalin: \"Who is Bob, exactly?\"\n\nThalin, also murmuring: \"A former associate of us. We changed our mind after he tried to get his 'East Gang' involved in our business.

Otherwise...\"\n\nBob the Hill Troll: \"If that's how you want it... East Gang, attack!\" Coming up from nowhere, numerous orcs started to show up.\n\nGimli: \"Thalin, my axe!

And if your horse-breakers are around, we could use their help.\"\n\nEowyn, nervous: \"Ok, sure... Rohirrim! Come along, we need help!\"\n\nA furious fight ensued across the East Bight. The two dwarves did their best to sustain the press of the East Gang, using feints left and right. Gimli even managed to knock down Bob the Hill Troll, but the numerous orcs kept the pressure on them. The poor Westfold Horse-Breakers were being thrown in harm's way to give breaks to the dwarves. Thalin was kept busy defending against Dol Guldur Orcs.\n\nIn the end, even with the unexpected assistance from a Gondorian Spearman looking for a quick way home after a vacation in the Mirkwood forest, they had to give up. The final straw was the appearance of Bob's favorite dog pack, a ferocious group of Wargs that kept jumping out of reach of the dwarves when they tried to counterstrike.\n\nGimli: \"Miss, miss, don't leave! We'll sort things out with those ruffians and we'll offer you a free descent along the Great River to compensate for your trouble.

If that's all the help you've got, you may as well turn back right away!\"\n\nBeorn: \"Sorry for being late, Gee. I was doing number two in the bushes. Well, where's that tro... oh, I see!\"\n\nPursued by shadows, the party was making progress, having reached the Banks of the Anduin. Beorn started wrestling with the troll, trying to push it back in the water. Just as they were passing over an Enchanted Stream, a sudden metamorphosis happened. Beorn's clothes tore apart as he grew in size and dark fur grew on his body. A large brown bear was now standing in place of the warrior, almost as large as the troll itself. Gimli made a feint on Bob's left side, freezing him into place, and Beorn attacked along with Thalin. Gimli join the fray and they finally brought the troll down. While the dwarves were catching their breath in huge gulp after this effort, the bear roared and returned toward the forest. On the other side of the river, a group of elves saluted the party's victory over the troll.\n\nEowyn: \"I'm not sure we should celebrate so soon. The rest of his gang will certainly show up.\"\n\nGimli: \"Yes, but with my trusty blade, I'll deal with them. Also, we hired a couple of spearmen to guard us. They were just waiting for Bob to 'give up' before they joined with us.\"\n\nThe group had to face numerous goblins and orcs as they kept progressing along the river, but with the help of a Gondorian Spearman, they made quick work of them.\n\nEowyn: \"Is the raft far? Where do we embark?\"\n\nThalin: \"No lady. Not far. Just across the Gladden Fields, we'll find our raft.\"\n\nThey finaly found the boat. A ranger was standing beside it on the pier.\n\nGimli: \"Finaly! Alright everyone! All aboard!\"\n\nThey left the pier and quickly reached the middle of the current, flowing south with great speed.\n\nThalin: \"Gimli, can I have a word with you? Are you sure it was a good idea to put our armor on as we were embarking? And do you have any idea what you're doing? After all, it's the first time we make it on the raft since starting our business. I don't remember us discussing our navigation skills before.\"\n\nGimli: \"What? I thought you were supposed to take care of the boat. I was in charge of marketing, you were to take care of operations!\"\n\nThalin: \"But I never set foot on a boat before! Dude, we're in trouble.\"\n\nAs they progressed along the river, they saw the banks starting to fill with enemies: wargs and orcs, apparently lead by a large chieftan. They were seeing the Necromancer's Pass coming up along the horizon as well as the Gladden Fields extension.\n\nGimli: \"Miss, I'm sorry, but we must abandon ship.\"\n\nEowyn: \"What?!? That's it, I've had enough of you two.\"\n\nShoving Thalin aside, she took charge and quickly guided the raft toward the bank.
