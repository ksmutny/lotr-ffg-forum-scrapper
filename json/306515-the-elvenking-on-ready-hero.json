In Ceorl's case, the \"Then, you may give control…\" would seem to prohibit triggering his Action when he is ready, as the effect after the \"Then\" cannot fire if what preceded it, i.e., the readying, did not occur. It would be different if Ceorl were worded like ally Sam, without a \"then\".\n\nThis whole principle is somewhat controversial—\"potential\" is never rigorously defined—and rulings around similar issues have been reversed in the past. But the above is how the current situation stands, I think."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306515-the-elvenking-on-ready-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3908063","commentId":3908063,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1583438169,"content":"Ceorl is a bad example. The way his ability is worded, you must ready him in order to give control.
