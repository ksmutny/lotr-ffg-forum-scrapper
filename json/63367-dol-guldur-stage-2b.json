Great fun and im doing better than ive done before but still not beating it. Anyway, ive a small query regarding stage 2B where ive rescued Bilbo (my random prisoner). Im nearing completing the stage but a Hummerhorn has just come down and killed Bilbo. (I chose him as i didnt want Glorfindel or Denethor getting killed). The bit im querying is on the 2B Quest card where it states that i cant advance to the next stage until i rescue the prisoner(Bilbo) and have the 3 objectives. Well ive rescued Bilbo and got all 3 objective cards so can i take it that ive stuck to the rules on the card even though the prisoner was killed later on in that quest stage? Or can i presume that the prisoner has to still be alive to complete this stage? Any advice would be great, cheers."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63367-dol-guldur-stage-2b/?do=findComment&comment=620093","commentId":620093,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1334918705,"content":"Ted Sandyman said:\n\nHi, ive been bashing away at Escaping from Dol Guldur all afternoon.
