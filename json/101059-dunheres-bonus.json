But as Dunhere's text stands it says that he \"can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone.\" I would say that \"alone\" is the keyword there.\n\n \n\nWhether you attack with an ally that is exhausted or not, if you declare anyone else other than Dunhere as an attacker against 1 enemy his ability will not trigger. A good thing though is that you only declare a target of attack against 1 enemy at a time. So for example you can have Dunhere speed into the engagement area by himself (with his +1 attack) to attack an enemy. Afterwards you can have other allies or heroes declare an attack against a different enemy in the staging area if you have the right effects that allow you to do so."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101059-dunheres-bonus/?do=findComment&comment=1030780","commentId":1030780,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1396037151,"content":"tacomen253, what are you talking about when you're talking about exhuasted characters? You can't attack with exhausted characters at all.\n\n \n\nI think I probably agree with most of you, but the wording could potentially go either way. I kinda feel like \"when he attacks alone\" is simply a condition, and isn't considered the action, which means that \"doing so\" could be simply pointing to the action, which is his attack targeting an enemy in the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101059-dunheres-bonus/?do=findComment&comment=1031152","commentId":1031152,"userName":"tacomen253","timestamp":1396063560,"content":"> tacomen253, what are you talking about when you're talking about exhuasted characters?

Just ignore it and the rest of paragraph works still just fine  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. \n\nEdited March 29, 2014 by tacomen253"}]}
