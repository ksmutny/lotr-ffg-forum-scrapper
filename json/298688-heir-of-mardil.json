You can't use Steward of Gondor in the planning phase then use the Heir to ready the hero in the questing phase. The hero needs to already be exhausted then gains resources for Heir of Mardil to be effective."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298688-heir-of-mardil/?do=findComment&comment=3760622","commentId":3760622,"userName":"bitzurock","timestamp":1565470219,"content":"Thank you !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298688-heir-of-mardil/?do=findComment&comment=3760744","commentId":3760744,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1565492734,"content":"> 6 hours ago, bitzurock said:\n> \n> How do i resolve the forced effect\n\nIt's not a forced effect, it's a response. Responses are always optional."}]}
