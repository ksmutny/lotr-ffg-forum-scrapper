We were wondering if we could trade our cards from our hand if we have heroes from diffrent pools?\n\n \n\n2. Is it possible to arrange you player deck in order to draw just cards from your heroe's pool.\n\n \n\n3. What does de cost X mean on for example the \"stand and fight\" card? That it costs 10 resource tokens?\n\n \n\n4. Is it possible to play just the beginner set with three players\n\n \n\n5. And lastly, do the player decks need to be equal in amount for each player?\n\n \n\nPS: We're from the Netherlands so sorry for my grammar if it's wrong ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]\n\n \n\nPS:PS: I know it's a lame excuse :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97510-co-op/?do=findComment&comment=960486","commentId":960486,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1390324991,"content":"Hi, and welcome to the game!\n\n \n\n1. You can't trade cards with another player.  Each player has their own deck, and draws from that deck only.\n\n \n\n2. You have to shuffle your deck.  You're not allowed to pre-arrange it.  But you're free to build the deck almost any way you want, so with just the Core set you should only be including cards that match your heroes' spheres of influence.  Are you drawing cards that you can't use?  Maybe there is a problem with how you have built your decks?\n\n \n\n3. X is a variable.  Whenever it shows up on a card, it is defined on the card.  In \"Stand and Fight,\" X is the cost of the ally that you choose to play from the discard pile.  So if you use it to play Faramir (cost 4), you need to pay 4 Spirit resources. If you use it to play an Erebor Hammersmith (cost 2), you need to pay 2 Spirit resources.\n\n \n\n4. You can play with 3 or even 4 players with just a core set.  It will be a little challenging to build effective decks, and you will have to use pen and paper, or dice, to keep track of 2 players' threat and probably resources as well.  But otherwise no problem.\n\n \n\n5. The number of cards does not need to be equal for each deck.  There is a \"tournament\" rule that each deck should contain a minimum of 50 cards, but don't worry about this when you are just starting out.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97510-co-op/?do=findComment&comment=960987","commentId":960987,"userName":"Junuki","timestamp":1390350684,"content":"Super awesome!\n\n \n\nThank you so much for the quick reply.
