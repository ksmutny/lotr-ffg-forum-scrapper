It really looks to work by itself really.\n\nThe obvious answer is no it cannot do its part untill attached hero is freed,\n\nIt is the logical but do the sack cards really forbid it?\n\nI speak about \"We must away ere break of day\" but I believe the question is about \"Conflict at tha Carrock\" also.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81936-sack-vs-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=782644","commentId":782644,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1365403034,"content":"No attachments are removed by being sacked. The sack cards do have a text that says \"Attached character cannot ready, attack, defend commit to quests, or trigger effects.\"\n\nThe part about triggering effects is a bit of a grey area, I think. While it obviously means that you can´t activate action or response effects on the character card, passive effects on those would still be active (Dain Ironfoot´s +1 bonus to willpower and attack comes to mind).\n\nWhere I´m a bit confused is wether it is implied that you cannot trigger effects on attachments that are attached to a sacked character. If you read it literally then you would still be able to activate attachments (which is how I play it myself) but if that is the intent, I don´t know."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81936-sack-vs-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=783593","commentId":783593,"userName":"ruchlas","timestamp":1365600427,"content":"I know that but I am talking about Asfaloth who is a horse and it cannot get into a sack with you like most attachments!\n\nIf you want a realistic experience of course!\n\nBut the game gives you the chance to keep it and use it right after been unsacked! But if you see it from the other side Asfaloth isn't\n\na simple horse , is it? He can remain hidden and wait for you!\n\nBut in the end I think it is simple. Sacked character is absent until freed. Keep Asfaloth but you can use it after being unsacked.\n\nAs for Dain, are we sure that his passive skill works even when he is sacked? Because I tend to include it among effects that cannot be triggered."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81936-sack-vs-asfaloth/?do=findComment&comment=783852","commentId":783852,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1365654470,"content":"But animals in Tolkiens universe have a much keener intellect and would be able to act on their own, even if temporarily deprived of their master.
