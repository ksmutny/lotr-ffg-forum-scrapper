For example if you have a burning brand and the shadow card with a shadow effect, the shadow effect will be canceled but the wargs will not leave since they shadow card they were dealt had a shadow effect. If the shadow card did not have an effect the wargs would still return to the staging are after the attack.\n\nIf you do not have enough encounter cards (the encounter deck empties before a shadow card is dealt to wargs) they should not  return to the staging area after attacking since in order to check whether the shadow card has a shadow effect you must first deal it. So if there is no card dealt the check cannot be triggered.\n\nI do not know what happens if you discard the shadow card before it resolves. Do you treat it as it was never dealt a shadow card or as it was dealt one?\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60529-another-wargs-question/?do=findComment&comment=594915","commentId":594915,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1329375207,"content":"scottindeed said:\n\nI was playing CaC the other day and the Wargs got dealt a Shadow Effect along the lines of \"If attacking creature is a Troll...\"  \n\nWhat happens to Wargs here?  Technically it was dealt a Shadow Card that had an effect printed on it.  It's just the effect had no effect!\n\n\n\nyes the only time they go back is when there is absolutly no effect printed"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60529-another-wargs-question/?do=findComment&comment=594928","commentId":594928,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1329376975,"content":" Thanks, that's how i decided to play it as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60529-another-wargs-question/?do=findComment&comment=594940","commentId":594940,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1329378578,"content":"I play it the other way.\n\nIf the shadow card dose not trigger though a condition, in this case checking for a troll, then the effect never triggers...if there is no shadow effect trigger, there is no shadow effect..... so in this case he goes to the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60529-another-wargs-question/?do=findComment&comment=594949","commentId":594949,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1329380407,"content":"mmmm....has this been faqed? wargs -If Wargs is dealt a shadow card with no effect, return Wargs to the staging area after it attacks\n \n\ni think it depends how you read NO effect.....\n\n \n\n1.if there is even a shadow effect written on the card, then there is indeed, a shadow effect therefore wargs will not return\n\n2.if the effect doesnt trigger then there is no effect acted upon, therefore wargs return\n\n \n\ntricky........."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60529-another-wargs-question/?do=findComment&comment=594978","commentId":594978,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1329385028,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nmmmm....has this been faqed? wargs -If Wargs is dealt a shadow card with no effect, return Wargs to the staging area after it attacks\n \n\ni think it depends how you read NO effect.....\n\n \n\n1.if there is even a shadow effect written on the card, then there is indeed, a shadow effect therefore wargs will not return\n\n2.if the effect doesnt trigger then there is no effect acted upon, therefore wargs return\n\n \n\ntricky.........\n\n\n\n \n\nI concur with your first conclusion.\nThe trigger is: 'Shadow Effect:'.

Canceling the results of the Shadow Effect is all it really does.\n\nLet's put this into some different terms:\n\nThis will be taking a train ride instead Combat.\nI am The Hero.\nThe Conductor is the Enemy.\nInstead of \"Reveal the Shadow Card\" it is \"The Conductor Approaches You\".\nThe Shadow Card has a Shadow Effect of giving paying the Conductor for a train ticket.\nMy Coupon For A Free Train Ride! is the Cancel Card.\n\nIf I am on the train and the conductor approaches me, he will ask me to pay $X for my train ride. I could save my Free Train Ride Coupon and pay $X, or I can just give him the coupon and be all set.\n\nThe difference here is no matter what, the Conductor still approaches me and asks me for money to ride the train. Me giving him the coupon acts like a cancel of paying him money for a train ticket. I can just as easily pay him for a train ticket and keep my coupon for the next train ride. Maybe the current price is pretty cheap and reasonable, so I should save my coupon for a time it's more expensive.\n\nSo, no matter what, the Conductor approaches me and tells me I need to give him $X to ride the train. Just because I gave him a coupon, doesn't mean there is nothing that happened.\n\nSimilarly, just because I am not affected by the end results of an effect, doesn't mean there was no effect happening.\n\nIf the Shadow Effect for the above scenario is \"Move to Seat 2\". If I'm already in Seat 2, that doesn't mean the Conductor doesn't still come over to tell me to move to Seat 2.\n\nAnyways, I'm reviewing a lot of the Shadow effects and there are tons that are conditional and won't do anything. If they needed to actually have a physical effect on the game in order to have the Wargs remain in combat, that would be ridiculous.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60529-another-wargs-question/?do=findComment&comment=597409","commentId":597409,"userName":"kirkbauer","timestamp":1329902160,"content":"cordeirooo said:\n\nbooored said:\n\n \n\nBomb said:\n\n \n\nThen it could also be argued that a canceled shadow effect would put the Warg back in the staging area.  A canceled effect is no effect.\n\n \n\n \n\nyes that is exactly how it works\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe attack is completed and then Wargs is returned to the staging area\nbefore you can attack him (since he is no longer engaged with the player)\n(official FAQ v1.1).
