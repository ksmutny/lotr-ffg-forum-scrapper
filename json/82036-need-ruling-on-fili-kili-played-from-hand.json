We need an official ruling.\n\nThe question: Let's say I have just one copy of both Fili and Kili in my whole deck, and they both end up in my starting hand. If I play Fili from my hand, can Kili accompany him? The text says \"search your deck for Kili and put him into play under your control.\" The connecting word is \"and\", not \"then\", so FAQ seciton 1.15 does not apply (if it did, then searching your deck would have to find Kili before I could play him). FAQ section 1.16 is very specific that \"put into play\" is not the same as \"play\" so it does not trigger any responses to the card being \"played\", but it doesn't help in this case, because the question is \"put into play from where?\" Since \"put into play\" has fewer restrictions than \"play\" (you don't need to pay the cost, for example), does that mean the card could come from anywhere that it would be legal to play the card? In other words, could \"put him into play\", which does not specify from where, bring the card out of my hand?\n\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=284&efcid=4&efidt=766347 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=284&efcid=4&efidt=766347] has a single answer of \"No\", but it's from another player, not an official ruling from an FFG game designer.\n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/thread/952824/kili-and-fili [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/952824/kili-and-fili] has mixed opinions, some saying this is legal and some saying it is not.\n\nhttp://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/958258/playing-fili-kili-if-both-are-in-your-hand [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/958258/playing-fili-kili-if-both-are-in-your-hand] also has mixed opinions, some saying \"Yes\" and some saying \"No\".\n\nPlayers are not able to reach a consensus on this one, and an official game designer ruling is needed.

If you play Fili and Kili is not in your deck, you should be able to search it and leave it unshuffled.  Funny.  Probably not intended.\n\nIn my own games, if you play one brother and the other is in hand (and no additional copies are in the deck), we don't allow the response to be triggered.  I do not think the card's intent is transparent, though.  It may very well be intended that you can play him from your hand even without the deck search.  I don't think the current wording supports that very well, but stranger rulings have come down!  Why not submit for some official perspective?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82036-need-ruling-on-fili-kili-played-from-hand/?do=findComment&comment=783153","commentId":783153,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1365502903,"content":"CJMatos said:\n\nThe FAQ says\n\n \n\n(1.15) The word “then”\nIf a card effect uses the word “then,” then the preceding\neffect must resolve successfully for the subsequent\ndependent effect to resolve.\n \nSo if you search the deck and don't find the brother, you cannot shuffle your deck because the preceding effect does not resolved successfully…\n\n\n\nHowever, in the same FAQ,\n\n(1.21) Search Effects\nWhenever a player searches through a deck, that player\nshuffles the deck after searching it unless a card effect\nsays otherwise.
