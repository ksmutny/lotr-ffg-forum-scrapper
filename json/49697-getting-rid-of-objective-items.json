Also if some shadow effect make you chose and discard any of your attachments you can chose and discard objective card(objective cards return to the staging area)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49697-getting-rid-of-objective-items/?do=findComment&comment=497890","commentId":497890,"userName":"Iver2","timestamp":1310360679,"content":"Cool questions...\n\nI also have one related to the thrid quest and regarding objectives in general.\n\n1. Do enemies which are placed as guards to objective engage players? I could not find the answer in a clear form so far.\n\n2. Let's say in the third quest in the third stage, if objectives cards are detached and returned into the staging area (as per card text), what happens to them? Will they get a new guard? Is this guard counted to the total of the encounter cards you should draw per player? Example: So, let say in a 2 player  with one objective in the staging area, a total of 3 encounter cards would be drawn, and one as guard?
