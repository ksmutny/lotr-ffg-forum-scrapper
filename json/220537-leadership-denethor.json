This game is notorious for being most difficult in the beginning of scenarios and rewarding rapid setup, and this guy is the king of rapid setup. You could argue that all his quality comes at the cost of weak stats, but he is also a solid defender!\n\nEnjoy him while you can because the moans of OP will soon arrive.
