I used to not keep the cards in them, but for various reasons i have had to change my storage solution and i am it seems one short of the new style packs. If anyone in the UK does not use them or usually chucks them away i would like to obtain one. I am happy to pay postage by paypal and add a Â£1 or so for your time.\n\nI have loads of the smaller size packs spare but you cannot put the new size picture sheet and rules insert into the smaller ones.\n\nI know its a long shot and maybe everyone keeps these plastic packs now but i thought i would ask and see.\n\nDavid\n\nEdited September 3, 2018 by Crusaderlord"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281977-spare-plastic-clamshell-packs-in-the-uk/?do=findComment&comment=3458891","commentId":3458891,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1535982209,"content":"Hi David\n\nI may be able to help - I've got some AHTCG packs I don't need.
