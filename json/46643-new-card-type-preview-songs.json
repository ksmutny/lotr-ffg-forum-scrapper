It is already easy to mix Leadership with other spheres! Give the other spheres some love! \n\nThere's also the preview for The Hills of Emyn Muil on the main LotR page. Not much new info, Gollum's trail has grown cold and you have to find more clues. Not quite as exciting sounding as sets 2-3, but the proof will be in the pudding. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46643-new-card-type-preview-songs/?do=findComment&comment=467076","commentId":467076,"userName":"InfernalZebra","timestamp":1305160498,"content":"DrNate said:\n\n Gah!

It's like, \"Leadership is clearly the best sphere, so now we've given you MORE ways to play it!\"\n\nComing soon: Song of Nerds, Song of Jocks, and Song of Singers!\n\nIn all seriousness, though, it looks pretty cool.
