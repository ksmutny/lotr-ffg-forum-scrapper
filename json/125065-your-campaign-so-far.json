I guess playing the campaign four player allows you to obtain all four boons from A Knife in the Dark.... but at the same time would be a much harder campaign and if each player didn't get one some decks would automatically be a bit weaker than others. So really earning Old Bogey-Stories by doing plenty of damage to Old Man Willow (which is not easy! he raises threat every attack and hits hard and many times too) is the best possible situation for boons as all the others are automatically earned.\n\n \n\nAs for burdens you can earn none in Flight to the Ford with some trickery and if you defeat the Balrog you only have to take two from Journey In the Dark instead of four. Also you can avoid the treachery in The Ring Goes South as well as one of the ones from Breaking of the Fellowship.

Anduril on Elrohir is ridiculously good.\n\nOn one of the saga quests (I think possibly Breaking of the Fellowship? But can't remember...) I had Gondorian Shield and Anduril attached to Elrohir as the two restricted attachments as well as steward and a dunedain warning. He was also receiving Arwens Buff every turn. This turned him into an 8 defense beast that could defend all attacks (or almost all attacks) for both players AND strike back with 3 attack power after one of his defenses every turn. So long as he was ready by the end of his defensive duties he could also attack a second time alongside other characters as well. If I had gotten an unexpected courage on him I would have used him to quest for 3 every round as well. Insanely insanely good.\n \n\nGlamdring on Haldir (who already has Valiant Warrior in my campaign) turns him into 6 attack for two resources, slap a blade on him and he can take out any enemy with a combined defense and health of 8 before they even engage/attack with his ability. Also insane, plus if you're taking out any orcs you get to draw cards as well!! Sting seems GREAT, especially paired with Frodo from Road Darkens but I haven't really used it yet as I pretty much always quest with Frodo.... Need to keep him back for combat so I can actually try out his ability.\n\n \n\nSo yeah definitely don't overlook these attachments, although you only get x1 of them and they get shuffled into your deck rather than in your hand at the start they've very very powerful if put on the right hero and can also be fetched with anything that fetches attachments. Galadriel ally into a free Anduril or Glamdring would be EPIC value.\n\nEdited October 23, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1309094","commentId":1309094,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1414069902,"content":"Solo Campaign\n\nSam - Merry - Pippin\n\nShadow of the past - Score 122\nBoon: Mr. Underhill\nBurden: The Ring Draws Them\n\nKnife in the Dark - 85\nBoons: Tireless Ranger (Sam)\\\n\n \n\nFlight to the Ford - 115\nBurdens: Overcome by Terror, Weight of the Ring\n\n \n\nThe Ring Goes South - 213\n\nKept Same Heroes\nBoons: Anduril & Glamdring (didn't currently have Noble or Warrior heroes), Sting & Mithril Shirt\nBurden: None (opted for 5 threat increase)\n\nJourney in the Dark - 110\nBurdens: Grevious Wounds, Overcome by Grief, Pursued by the Enemy, and Shadow of Fear\nBalrog Defeated: No\nFallen Hero: Pippin!

A few thoughts on my experience whilst doing so.\nSo far the hardest quest for me is definitely Journey in the Dark, I have not been able to replicate my single succesful victory where I also ressurected the sacrificed hero. It took several attempts to get that first win and I played the quest more times than it took for the first victory whilst on my quest to get better scores/outcomes and was just unable to beat it again.\nMost of the Black Riders quests seem a fair bit easier now will all the new player cards from Road Darkens and the Ring Maker cycle but are still not a walk in the park and require good decks and strategy. I still find the first quest A Shadow of the Past, the hardest and find the other two much easier. Any difficulty decrease these three quests had in my games was balanced by the two new quests The Old Forest and Fog on the Barrow Downs. Both of these are challenging in their own ways and both very fun as well.\n\nThe Ring Goes South and Flight to the Ford are in my opinion the two easiest quests so far in the Saga and the second hardest after Journey in the Dark is probably The Old Forest or A Shadow of the Past.\n\nI loved playing through The Road Darkens even more the second time (even with the 6 or more losses against Journey in the Dark) and got much better scores and outcomes for The Ring Goes South and Breaking of the Fellowship. Very excited for Treason of Saruman.

I seriously considered sacrificing Boromir to keep with theme, but enemies never bothered me that much and I couldn't bring myself to do it.  Also, I had a chance for Boromir to Fall Into Evil, but I chose Merry (then Elronded him back to my side) instead so that I wouldn't lose.\n\nCampaign Pool:\nBoons: Gildor, Skilled Healer and Phial on Sam, Valiant Warrior on Aragorn,  Three Golden Hairs on Boromir Deck1: Anduril, Mithril Shirt, Sting; Deck 2: Glamdring,\nBurdens: The Ring Draws Them,  Overcome by Grief, Pursued by the Enemy, Followed by Night\nFallen Hero: Gandalf\nCaptives: Merry, Pippin\n\nA Shadow of the Past\nHeroes:\nDeck 1: Sam, Merry, Pippin\nDeck 2: Aragorn (lore), Glorfindel, Fatty\nBoon: Gildor Inglorion\nBurden: The Ring Draws Them\n\nA Knife in the Dark:\nHeroes:\nDeck 1: Sam, Merry, Pippin\nDeck 2: Aragorn (lore), Glorfindel, Fatty\nBoons: Skilled Healer on Sam\n               Valiant Warrior on Aragorn\n\nFlight to the Ford\nHeroes:\nDeck 1: Sam, Merry, Pippin\nDeck 2: Aragorn (lore), Glorfindel, Fatty\nBurden: The Weight of the Ring\n\n \n\nRing Goes South\nHeroes:\nDeck 1: Aragorn (lead), Sam, Pippin\nDeck 2: Gandalf, Legolas, Boromir\nBoons: Anduril, Sting, Mithril Shirt (Deck 1), Glamdring (Deck 2)\n\nJourney in the Dark\nHeroes:\nDeck 1: Aragorn (lead), Sam, Pippin\nDeck 2: Gandlaf, Legolas, Boromir\nGandalf sacrificed to defeat the Balrog\nBurdens: Overcome by Grief, Pursued by the Enemy\n\nBreaking of the Fellowship\nHeroes:\nDeck 1: Aragorn (lead), Sam, Pippin\nDeck 2: Boromir, Merry, Legolas\nBurden: Followed by Night\nBoons: Phial attached to Sam, Three Golden Hairs attached to Boromir\nBurden Removed: Weight of the Ring\nCaptives: Merry, Pippin\n\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1343194","commentId":1343194,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1416672189,"content":"Glowwyrm did you use Lore or Spirit Pippen?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1343266","commentId":1343266,"userName":"Glowwyrm","timestamp":1416677986,"content":"Lore.  Sorry for not specifying that, the thought of there being another version of Pippin never crossed my mind. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1343279","commentId":1343279,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1416678356,"content":"> Lore.  Sorry for not specifying that, the thought of there being another version of Pippin never crossed my mind. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nAccess to Spirit and threat reduction is pretty good on TRD quests, especially through Moria, but sure, Lore Pippen is much better in a vacuum."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1343328","commentId":1343328,"userName":"Glowwyrm","timestamp":1416683371,"content":">  \n> \n> > Lore.  Sorry for not specifying that, the thought of there being another version of Pippin never crossed my mind. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n> \n> Access to Spirit and threat reduction is pretty good on TRD quests, especially through Moria, but sure, Lore Pippen is much better in a vacuum.\n> \n>  \n\nGandalf brought threat reduction to the Tactics deck with Galadrim's Greeting, and Black Riders Frodo offers cancellation, so I've found using a Spirit hero to be less crucial than it is in other scenarios."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1343399","commentId":1343399,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1416689432,"content":"While struggling with Journey in the Dark I went back and forth between Lore and Spirit Pippin several times.  The encounter deck just didn't give me much time to fish out a song, and I wanted cancellation and Power or Orthanc early.  In the end I won while using the Lore version, though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1343425","commentId":1343425,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1416691269,"content":"My struggle exactly.
