Gilthoniel! (O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!) [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=695]\n\n \n\nResponse: After a non-unique enemy attacks you, put that enemy on the bottom of the encounter deck. If your threat is lower than that enemy's engagement cost, set your threat equal to the engagement cost of that enemy.\n\n \n\nWhen do the response trigger during an enemy attack? \n\n- after declaring the attacking enemy?\n\n- after declaring the defender?\n\n- after resolving the schadoweffects?\n\n- after determining combat damage?\n\n \n\nI think .. after attacks you describes the whole attack including all steps from declaring the attacking enemy to determining combat damage. So i can play it after the attack is completely resolved .. not a step before.. right?\n\nEdited February 20, 2015 by JanB"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135509-playtime-of-o-elbereth-gilthoniel/?do=findComment&comment=1457947","commentId":1457947,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1424474927,"content":"I'm 99% sure it's after dealing combat damage and the attack is completely resolved.  Otherwise that's the worst wording ever. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135509-playtime-of-o-elbereth-gilthoniel/?do=findComment&comment=1458347","commentId":1458347,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1424508290,"content":"+1 Confirm."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135509-playtime-of-o-elbereth-gilthoniel/?do=findComment&comment=1462547","commentId":1462547,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1424779943,"content":"Yes, after is mean after 4 steps of combat resolve\n\n1 choose enemy\n\n2 reveal shadow card\n\nDetermine combat damage\n\nApply combat damage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135509-playtime-of-o-elbereth-gilthoniel/?do=findComment&comment=1462609","commentId":1462609,"userName":"krokodiler","timestamp":1424783452,"content":"I concur (supported by FAQ, p. 8):\n\nQ: When do “after this enemy attacks” Forced effects like those on Chieftan Ufthak (CORE 90) and Wargs (CORE 85) resolve?\nA: These effects resolve immediately after step 4 of enemy attack resolution.

Sure, it was probably Aragorn standing up to them and not cowering that weakened their resolve, but also hearing someone knowing a name of such power probably threw them for a loop. It is also worth noting that while the Nazgul are utter badasses, I've always imagined they fell due to lack of willpower and inner strength."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135509-playtime-of-o-elbereth-gilthoniel/?do=findComment&comment=1466670","commentId":1466670,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1424981568,"content":"There is also a moment in the Shire when Frodo spots a Ringwraith crawling towards him.
