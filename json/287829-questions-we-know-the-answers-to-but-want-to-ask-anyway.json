I like the idea, but I don't think having a hero in play at the end of the game allows you to add their name to the list of heroes you are using. There isn't a mechanic to do it. You can only add names per campaign rules between quests, at which point you're doing so by selecting cards from the card pool, not from an active game.  😕\n\n2. Yep!  If that deck runs out in the combat phase, you get some attacks from enemies without shadow cards. It's nice.  \n\n3. Unfortunately we've had rulings recently which clarify that there isn't a way to 'cheat' guarded cards into play.  The dwarf card 'Well-Equipped' allows you to attach a card to a dwarf in play.  I guess what happens is that the card will enter play attached to the dwarf (?) but then you'll have to get a guarded card, remove your attachment from the dwarf, and attach it to the guard."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287829-questions-we-know-the-answers-to-but-want-to-ask-anyway/?do=findComment&comment=3567244","commentId":3567244,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1544811423,"content":"1) I don't think you can add that hero.  Worse yet, the fallen hero penalty depends on a hero being in the discard, so if you had Prince Imrahil [hero] in the discard play and then played Prince Imrahil ally, Imrahil would still be a fallen hero despite a hero Imrahil still being in play.  (Full disclosure -- I've decided to ignore the fallen hero penalty for the self-discarding Caldara, rather than having to Fortune-or-Fate her in every quest).\n\n2) Don't player cards that interact with the encounter deck force a reshuffle if necessary?  For example, if the encounter deck was empty during the planning phase, I don't think you can play Guarded player cards with impunity.\n\n3) Master Ironsmith covers the resource cost, but not the Guarded cost."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287829-questions-we-know-the-answers-to-but-want-to-ask-anyway/?do=findComment&comment=3567248","commentId":3567248,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1544811856,"content":"> 1 minute ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> 2) Don't player cards that interact with the encounter deck force a reshuffle if necessary?  For example, if the encounter deck was empty during the planning phase, I don't think you can play Guarded player cards with impunity.\n\nThats what I figured. For example, during roam across rhovanion, we ran out of cards while dealing shadow cards, and we were engaged with urdug while his horn was attached. It prompted to discard the top of the encounter deck when he attacks and adds the threat of the discarded card to his attack. \n\nI think the rule should stand (as far as I can see) that the encounter deck is not auto reset ONLY when dealing shadow cards.

Iterating through the list, committing each character individually as it comes up, and for each time a Response is relevant, doing it right then.\n\nThis is not unreasonable. But, it is not what the rules say to do.\n\nTo me, it is somewhat akin to people discarding shadow cards immediately after the enemy attack resolves. They learned the game doing it that way, 99% of the time it doesn't affect anything compared to the Correct Way, so why bother changing? That's anyone's prerogative, but they should know that it does occasionally have a functional effect.\n\nEdited December 24, 2018 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287829-questions-we-know-the-answers-to-but-want-to-ask-anyway/?do=findComment&comment=3574979","commentId":3574979,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1545668589,"content":"> 42 minutes ago, sappidus said:\n> \n> Allowing one-by-one character committal represents a buff to characters like Firyal and Longbeard Elder, as now you'd be able to use the info from the scry to tweak who you're going to commit.\n> \n> Committing one at a time also nerfs things like the core Aragorn-Theodred interaction—if Aragorn has no initial resources, they would not be able to support each other.\n> \n> Whether these kinds of side effects are OK is to some extent a matter of taste, but the rules, and rulings, have always been quite clear on the designer intent.\n\nI am not disputing the meaning and intent of the rules (nor do I play differently), simply that even though there are situations where the rules' approach is more balanced and useful, at other times it can cause \"issues\".\n\nEdited December 24, 2018 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287829-questions-we-know-the-answers-to-but-want-to-ask-anyway/?do=findComment&comment=3574995","commentId":3574995,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1545670438,"content":"@Rouxxor [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/308704-rouxxor/] are you referring to the travel cost question?\n\nThe situation I wrote about, “Travel: Discard until...” was hypothetical, I’m not sure if any card exists like that. Maybe one exists which says “Travel: Shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck and discard until...”.   If that happened, and you still couldn’t find the type of card you were lookjng for, I think maybe you would just travel to the location for “free” (other than the “cost” of discarding cards from the deck). That’s opposite from what I said earlier , I’m not that sure about it.  But the recent ruling about Sting makes me think that way. \n\nIf you play Sting and there is no enemy in the encounter deck, the rules tell you infinitely reshuffle the deck and infinitely discard cards.  Caleb rules that you would do the effect as completely as you could: discard til deck is empty, reshuffle, then discard til empty again. At that point you are sure that there is no matching card type. So, you stop reshuffling and attach Sting to your character. So maybe a travel effect worded in this way would work similarly. \n\nI don’t think you would reshuffle the encounter deck for that effect though, since it’s during the travel phase. Only if the card actually tells you to do so."}]}
