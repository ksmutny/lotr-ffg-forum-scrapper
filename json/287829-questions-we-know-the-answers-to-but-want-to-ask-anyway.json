If you are playing in Saga mode, and you promote a unique ally to hero using sword thaine or prince imrahils ability, can you add that hero to your pool without incurring the +1 threat penalty?\n\n2. Is the quest phase the only time the encounter deck gets reset unless explicitly told to reset the encounter deck by a card?\n\n3.

I like the idea, but I don't think having a hero in play at the end of the game allows you to add their name to the list of heroes you are using. There isn't a mechanic to do it. You can only add names per campaign rules between quests, at which point you're doing so by selecting cards from the card pool, not from an active game.  😕\n\n2. Yep!  If that deck runs out in the combat phase, you get some attacks from enemies without shadow cards. It's nice.  \n\n3. Unfortunately we've had rulings recently which clarify that there isn't a way to 'cheat' guarded cards into play.  The dwarf card 'Well-Equipped' allows you to attach a card to a dwarf in play.  I guess what happens is that the card will enter play attached to the dwarf (?) but then you'll have to get a guarded card, remove your attachment from the dwarf, and attach it to the guard."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287829-questions-we-know-the-answers-to-but-want-to-ask-anyway/?do=findComment&comment=3567244","commentId":3567244,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1544811423,"content":"1) I don't think you can add that hero.  Worse yet, the fallen hero penalty depends on a hero being in the discard, so if you had Prince Imrahil [hero] in the discard play and then played Prince Imrahil ally, Imrahil would still be a fallen hero despite a hero Imrahil still being in play.  (Full disclosure -- I've decided to ignore the fallen hero penalty for the self-discarding Caldara, rather than having to Fortune-or-Fate her in every quest).\n\n2) Don't player cards that interact with the encounter deck force a reshuffle if necessary?  For example, if the encounter deck was empty during the planning phase, I don't think you can play Guarded player cards with impunity.\n\n3) Master Ironsmith covers the resource cost, but not the Guarded cost."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287829-questions-we-know-the-answers-to-but-want-to-ask-anyway/?do=findComment&comment=3567248","commentId":3567248,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1544811856,"content":"> 1 minute ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> 2) Don't player cards that interact with the encounter deck force a reshuffle if necessary?  For example, if the encounter deck was empty during the planning phase, I don't think you can play Guarded player cards with impunity.\n\nThats what I figured. For example, during roam across rhovanion, we ran out of cards while dealing shadow cards, and we were engaged with urdug while his horn was attached. It prompted to discard the top of the encounter deck when he attacks and adds the threat of the discarded card to his attack. \n\nI think the rule should stand (as far as I can see) that the encounter deck is not auto reset ONLY when dealing shadow cards. Again, not an explicit rule but then otherwise there seems to be breaking the spirit of the game.\n\nLike I said,I think we all know the answers to these questions but they're fun to ask anyway.🙃"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287829-questions-we-know-the-answers-to-but-want-to-ask-anyway/?do=findComment&comment=3567502","commentId":3567502,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1544825827,"content":"> 4 hours ago, GrandSpleen said:\n> \n> 3.

In RR Staging, \"reveal\" shows up in the RR as part of the explanation of Staging step #1  to denote the simple act of turning the card face-up. But this is a slightly different use than when reveal shows up in card text, which is also defined in the RR.
