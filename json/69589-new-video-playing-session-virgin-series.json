You can watch me play against Shadow and Flame without looking at the Encounter deck prior to playing, aka my very first game.

There is mistakes but not really important.\n\nthere is one mistakes trick with second quest card. When you revealed this card you should to add 4 quest points to this cards cose you have hero commit to the quest previously  on the first stage.Even when you just came to second quest card you put progress tokens in the end of the quest phase. I hope you understand what i mean.\n\nActually this quest is quite stupid  and monotony special when you have Hama and feint + Beravur or Bibo to cycle feint. And you dont care about Balrog anymore! Quite annoying no?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69589-new-video-playing-session-virgin-series/?do=findComment&comment=679706","commentId":679706,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1345648161,"content":"Uuuu but in the end there was a lot od mistakes so i didn think this game is a legal win.

And so does Frodo I guess.\n\nGlaurung said:\n\n\nUuuu but in the end there was a lot od mistakes so i didn think this game is a legal win. Anyway cool game\n\n\n\nDid you find additional mistakes apart from the ones I mentioned already? Let me know, I want to improve."}]}
