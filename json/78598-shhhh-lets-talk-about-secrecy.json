It's not done but considering the hotness of the topic, I'll just put it up here.\n\n \n\nAn Exploration of Secrecy\n\n \n\nSecrecy Cards This section will look only at the cards that contain the key word secrecy and the themes that they support.\n\n \n\nLore\n\nNeedful to Know Resource Cost 2. Secrecy 2. Net Cost 0 Theme: threat reduction\n\nOut of the Wild Resource Cost 3. Secrecy 2. Net Cost 1 Theme: encounter control\n\nRisk Some Light Resource Cost 3. Secrecy 3. Net Cost 0 Theme: encounter control\n\n \n\nSpirit\n\nO Elbereth! Gilthonial! Resource Cost 4. Secrecy 4. Net Cost 0 Theme: enemy removal\n\nOut of Sight Resource Cost 5 Secrecy 3. Net Cost 2 Theme: enemy can't attack this round\n\n \n\nLeadership\n\nDunedain Wanderer Resource Cost 5. Secrecy 3. Net Cost 2Theme: ally\n\nTimely Aid Resource Cost 4. Secrecy 3. Net Cost 1 Theme: ally\n\n \n\nUnaligned\n\nResourceful Resource Cost 4. Secrecy 3. Net Cost 1 Theme: Resource generation.\n\n \n\n \n\nThemes\n\nSecrecy card break down into five themes. 1) Resource generation. 2) Enemy removal. 3) Encounter deck control 4) Allies and 5) Threat reduction.\n\nThe most important theme of the five is probably threat reduction since without this none of the secrecy cards are economically viable. But the secrecy theme itself lends little support to the threat reduction theme. It relies on spirit cards. I will look at some of the cards that support each of the themes.\n\nCards Supporting Encounter Control Theme\n\n \n\nLore\n\nHenamarth Riversong: Cost: 1 Ability: Look at top of the encounter deck. You can’t control what you can’t see.\n\nRumors From the Earth: Cost 0 (1 to return to hand); Ability: Look at top of the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nSpirit\n\nA Watchful Peace: Cost: 1; Ability: Place a resolved location on top of the encounter deck. Some encounter cards have benefits or mild. Use this to recycle them and delay encounter with more difficult cards.\n\n \n\nUnaligned\n\nShadow of the Past: Cost 2; Ability: Place top of the encounter discard on top of the encounter deck. (See A Watchful Peace)\n\n \n\nCards Supporting Enemy Removal or Enemy Control Theme\n\n \n\nLore\n\nForest Snare: Cost 3; Ability: Engaged enemy can no longer attack.\n\nRanger Spikes: Cost 2; Ability: Enemy becomes trapped in the encounter area and has -2 Threat\n\nExpecting Mischief: Cost 1; Ability: Deals two damage to enemy when it is revealed during quest. Works only if you know what’s on top of the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nSpirit\n\nA Light in the Dark: Cost 2; Return enemy to the staging area.\n\n \n\nLeadership\n\nTake Initiative: Cost 0; Cards with a cost greater than 2 revealed from the deck result in 2 damage and two cards drawn.\n\n \n\nCards Supporting Threat Reduction Theme\n\n \n\nSpirit\n\nThe Galadhrim’s Greeting: Cost 3; Ability reduce threat by 6 for solo game.\n\nElrond’s Council: Cost 0 but requires a Nodor hero; reduce threat by 3 and increase quest by 1.\n\n \n\nUnaligned\n\nGandalf: Cost 5; Reduce threat by 5 or do 4 damage to an enemy\n\n \n\nHeroes for a Secrecy Deck\n\n \n\nSpirit\n\nEleanor – Threat 7; Exhaust to cancel a when revealed effect.\n\nGlorfindel – Threat 5; Pound-for-pound, the best secrecy hero. His drawback of 1 threat for exhausting when questing is offset by cards like Light of Valar and Asfaloth.\n\n \n\nLore\n\nDenethor – Threat 8; Exhaust to look at the top of the encounter deck and move it to the bottom if you wish.\n\nAragorn – Threat 12; Ability to reset your threat to the beginning level is great. Because of high starting threat should only combine with Glorfindel.\n\n \n\nLeadership\n\nTheodred – Threat 8; With his ability, combined with Steward of Gondor and Resourceful, he becomes a resource machine to crank out allies.\n\nAragorn – Threat 12; He can become a resource machine also but should only be used with Glorfindel.\n\n \n\nSomewhere in this theme is a tri-sphere deck waiting to come out, but I’m not sure I can quite pull it off.\n\nSpirit is a must because lower threat is the engine that runs the whole machine. So that means Glorfindel.\n\nGlorfindel – Aragorn (lore) is very good but lacks followers and resource development.\n\nI may try Glorfindel –Denethor next without much change from the above because of his great ability.\n\nI’m very interested in giving Glorfindel Theodred a build and place a few songs in there to give Theodred the lore trait. My concern is a draw without Light of the Valor AND a song will mean frustrations in a lot of games."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78598-shhhh-lets-talk-about-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=757459","commentId":757459,"userName":"NotAZombie","timestamp":1359763186,"content":"I have actually made a reasonably successful solo secrecy deck, (not amazing, but it holds its own).

Heirs is a good example. Also, a solo secrecy deck has very different strategy than two-play secrecy.\n\nI find secrecy a fun theme for encouter deck manipulation.
