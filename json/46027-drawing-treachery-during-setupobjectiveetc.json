We thought they wouldn't go off because most of the Treachery cards really don't hurt you during Setup, like ones that deal damage to exhausted characters, or make you lose progress tokens. I guess some of the attachment type ones can still be a pain... but the odds are certainly better this way. Hmm, what about the card that increases your corruption for each character not on a quest? Would that just be ignored since questing hasn't happened, or would you take 3 corruption each (for the 3 heroes you have 'not on a quest')?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46027-drawing-treachery-during-setupobjectiveetc/?do=findComment&comment=461423","commentId":461423,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1304163415,"content":"Do Treachery cards get resolved when they are dealt as shadow cards?
