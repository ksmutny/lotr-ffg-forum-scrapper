But it keeps the portability and extensive features of its predecessor.\n\nAs for my previous Deck Builder programs, it is a FREEWARE and runs on any Windows 9X/2K/XP system (or Linux/Mac OS using Windows Emulator programs).\n\nThe minimum requirements are :\n- About 3 MB of free disk space (without pictures)\n- A graphic resolution of 1024x600 pixels in thousands of colors (higher resolution is strongly recommended).\n\nThe software does not require any additionnal DLL, runtime or database and does not install anything into the system folders or registry.\n\nIt is fully translated in both English and French. You can independently select the displayed language for:\n\n- The main user interface\n- The built-in semi-graphic card display and cards lists\n- The use of external picture libraries in one of the two languages.\n\nIt contains a complete database of the published cards in english and french, including FAQ corrections, flavor texts and illustrator names.\nIt displays cards in a compact manner to keep the software as light as possible.\nThis is the best spoiler list you may have at your fingertips.\n\nThere are extensive filtering capabilities for player and encounter cards lists, custom sorting, full statistics, scratchpad for deck preparations and more.\n\nYou can add cards to your deck with just one click and adjust quantities very quickly.\n\nThe deck list can be loaded, saved, exported (text-delimited, spoiler and html formats).\n\nMore features will be added to the software in the next weeks and months.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS NOT SUPPORTED BY FANTASY FLIGHT PUBLISHING INC., so ask me directly for any support, suggestions or bug reports.\n\nHappy deckbuilding\n\n(Nyarla)Zorbec\n\nFOR THE LATEST RELEASE NEWS, PLEASE READ THE LAST MESSAGES OF THE TOPIC\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47699-lotr-lcg-deck-builder-for-windows/?do=findComment&comment=478276","commentId":478276,"userName":"Nyarlazorbec","timestamp":1306923058,"content":"To complement the above description, here are some informations about the current version of the software.\n\nCurrent version is Beta 0.7.0.\n\nIt is already stable and upward compatibility of deck files will be maintained in next versions.\n\nSome features are not implemented yet in this beta version, but they will be in the next weeks and months, including:\n\n- Deck printing\n- Deck checking\n- More single card, deck or cards lists export formats (spoilers, etc...)\n- etc...\n\nAlso, I didn't had time yet to upload complete pictures packages for the software.

To do this, click on the button on the left of the \"Search from\" path display.\n * Next, you can define up to 4 search criteria which can be a hero card, a deck card, a word or sentence in the deck's notes or any text in the information fields of the deck.\n * Then, press the \"Search\" button to find the corresponding decks. If no criteria are selected, all decks will be checked and listed.\n * The \"Results\" button only appears after a first search run with at least one deck found to bring you back to the previously found decks.\n   If you exit the Deck Finder and come back to it, it will keep the results of the previous search (but not if you exit from the DeckBuilder itself).\n\nThe Results display is shown below:\n\nscreenshot19_deckfinder.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot19_deckfinder.jpg]\n \n\n * The list on the left shows the found decks. Select one to display its contents on the right part of the screen.\n * The list on the right shows all informations, heroes, deck cards, scratchpad cards and notes of the deck. If you select a line with a card, the card is displayed the usual ways, like other screens.\n * You can stop the search by clicking a button not shown here.\n * The \"Open deck\" button will try to open the selected deck into the DeckBuilder and close the Deck Finder. If a modified deck is already open, the software will ask you what to do.\n * If you want to take only part of the selected deck, you can use the copy buttons for general informations, notes and complete heroes or deck cards contents. The positions/quantities buttons are also available for heroes/deck cards to make a partial import of data.\n\nBe carefull with the partial import features : it does not ask anything if you had a modified deck already open.\n\nI hope you'll find the DeckBuilder useful.

For instance, I don't have Osgiliath, so I do not want to see cards from that expansion. \n\n You have that in the Filters and Sort pages of the encounter screen. The point is that the filters setting is not persistent between two DeckBuilder sessions, but sort orders are.

How would I find the place to select which sets are included? \n\n\n\nHi,\n\nFrom the main screen, click on the button showing an encounter card back (the first on the left). If correctly activated, it should be surrounded by a yellow line. This will bring the Encounter cards screen up (if not, it means that the screen is probably moved outside your screen limits for some reason. In this case, you can reset all screens positions by pressing the Ctrl+Alt+L keys).\n\nIn the Encounter cards screen, click on the \"Filters\" top bar button to display the filters. The first filters page is for encounter sets. If you selected a speficic quest or scenario in the \"Scenario/quests\" screen, you can filter the sets used for the scenario by clicking on the \"Scenario\" blue button located above the sets list.\n\nIf you want to sort the list, click on the \"Card sorting\" top bar button to display the sorting page. There, you can combine up to 4 sort criteria in any order (ascending or descending).\n\nHope this helps ! (if not, ask again !)\n\nCheers,\n\nZorbec"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47699-lotr-lcg-deck-builder-for-windows/?do=findComment&comment=519248","commentId":519248,"userName":"Nyarlazorbec","timestamp":1314174650,"content":"GhostWolf69 said:\n\nAmAvocet said:\n\nI have just started trying to figure it out, and I didn't see an encounter screen (or at least did not recognize it).

Beware : zooming the picture slows down the picture display and the navigation in cards lists.\n * Added deck card management using the keyboard into the following lists: player cards, deck cards, scratchpad.\n   Select one of the above lists and press one of the following keys:\n   0 (zero) -> Remove the card from the deck\n   1, 2, 3 -> Add the card to the deck, with the selected quantity (or at the selected position for heroes)\n   S -> Add the card to the scratchpad (does not work within the scratchpad itself)\n   Note : to remove a card from the scratchpad, you still have to use the mouse.\n * Additions and corrections to the extensions filters of player and encounter cards lists:\n   - The filters' states are saved between two sessions of the DeckBuilder.\n   - They are not changed by the global filter reset operation anymore, and they are the placed first in the filters pages.\n    -The original grid is replaced by a treeview to enhance selection of sets by full cycle.\n * Corrected the screens position restoration on multiple-screens configuration.\n * Corrected missing and incorrect columns in the player cards and deck lists.\n * Corrected the statistics boundaries for player and deck cards and the corresponding distribution graphs. The values with zero quantities are automatically removed from distribution graphs.\n\nMany thanks to Drew of www.cardgamedb.com for the english scans of the last pack.\n\nNext version will include the first \"The Hobbit\" saga extension and corrected statistics for encounter cards.\n\nComments, suggestions (and kudos) are welcome !\n\nHave fun !\n\nZorbec\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47699-lotr-lcg-deck-builder-for-windows/?do=findComment&comment=715830","commentId":715830,"userName":"Nyarlazorbec","timestamp":1351422564,"content":"Hello,\n\nA NEW VERSION OF THE DECKBUILDER IS AVAILABLE !\n\nSorry, again, for the long delay.

Once copied into the folder where the DeckBuilder is installed, the card images do not show in the application.\n\n \n\nIn most cases, this comes from the default behaviour of Windows 7 or 8 UAC, which protects the default \"C:\\Program Files\" folder (and its derivative on 64bit version of the system) used for program installation. The UAC prevents the installed program to see files copied manually after the installation.\n\n \n\nThere are two solutions to this situation:\n\n \n\n1) Adjust the UAC to low level or disabled state. This reduces your system's security. So, if you are not sure, don't do that and apply the next solution ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\n2) Resintall the DeckBuilder into a folder not protected by the UAC:\n\n * Make a backup copy of your deck files and .dat files which are into the current DeckBuilder folder.\n * Then, uninstall the DeckBuilder\n * Download the last version of the DeckBuilder\n * Install and, if necessary, change the destination folder for installation to something like \"C:\\DeckBuilders\" or \"C:\\Card Games\". Do not use \"C:\\Windows\" or \"C:\\Program Files\" or \"C:\\Program Files(x86)\".\n * Copy back your deck and .dat files into the new folder, after the installation is complete.\n\nThe version 1.1.13 and above of the DeckBuilder setup program will propose a folder like that, but it works only if you make a new installation. An update of a previous version will not move the program to another location.\n\nThough, I found that the proposed folder, by default, for the installation is not very convenient, generating a supplementary level of folder depth. So, please adjust it to a single folder level or wait for the next version...\n\n \n\nCheers,\n\n \n\nZorbec"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47699-lotr-lcg-deck-builder-for-windows/?do=findComment&comment=1214200","commentId":1214200,"userName":"JasonRed3","timestamp":1408541108,"content":"I installed in C:\\CardGames on Windows 7.  Does not work.   In addition, the Image Pack builder does not work either."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47699-lotr-lcg-deck-builder-for-windows/?do=findComment&comment=1214263","commentId":1214263,"userName":"Nyarlazorbec","timestamp":1408543385,"content":"Hummmm....you may have another situation then...\n\n \n\nCould you be more specific about what \"does not work\" and how, please ?\n\n \n\nAny error message ?\n\nDid you copy the .dat files where the DeckBuilder.exe application is installed ?\n\nHave the .dat files the correct size compared to the size given on the download page ?\n\n \n\nLet me know.\n\n \n\nZorbec"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47699-lotr-lcg-deck-builder-for-windows/?do=findComment&comment=1214419","commentId":1214419,"userName":"JasonRed3","timestamp":1408548131,"content":"Yes.  The program runs fine... but the images do not load/show at all.\n\n \n\nThe only error message I get is when I try to run the Image Pack Builder (not sure if that's needed at all)\n\nJ"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47699-lotr-lcg-deck-builder-for-windows/?do=findComment&comment=1216016","commentId":1216016,"userName":"Nyarlazorbec","timestamp":1408599828,"content":"Hi J,\n\n \n\nI suggest that you contact me by email (you'll find my email address in the readme.txt file).\n\n \n\nPlease, send me a screen capture showing your DeckBuilder started, so that I can see more clearly how you set the screens up.\n\nAlso, it would be interesting if you could do a screen capture of the Windows' Explorer opened on the installation folder of the DeckBuilder, showing the files present into this folder with full details (file sizes and dates at least).\n\n \n\nThe ImagePackBuilder is only usefull to build your own packs.
