I think most other people at this forum was expecting exactly this. On NM pack PoD, each quest sold seperately for around $7 each. Which actually is the only way to do it (no offense meant here) I don't wanna Escape from Dol Guldur to be more challenging but I'd like Anduin and Passage to be. So if they release them in bundles a la expansion packs I'd have to pay for quests I don't want. Thus making the ones in the bundle more expansive. Same goes for making a bundle pack gathering all six AP's from a cycle.\n\nAnd I apologize if you where offended. I didn't mean to do that. I just wanted to make a statement that people should stop complaining about everything all the time, stop up and be a satisfied with SOMETHING instead :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I learned long time ago that disappointments are mostly our own faults.

These are not mas produced (so they say) and anyone that has custom printed there own cards can attest that cost is a factor. Also you can not ***** about postage. FFG has absolutely NO SAY in postage cost. They set a price so they can make a profit and pay everyone and add whatever is needed to post to far off places like Australia.\n\n \n\nA PoD with postage to Au is 21.xx bucks US = nearly 24AU.\n\n3 PoDs = 42.xx USD = 47au\n\n \n\nSo it is basically double the price.\n\n \n\nBad, I guess... but NOT FFGs fault.\n\n \n\nYour best bet is to get the PoDs from a large internet store like FunAgain or CoolStuff or Lotusvault or w/e These places stock all the FFG PoDs. is it cheaper? no.. but you can stack your order with a ton of other stuff.

what hero combination would work best? etc. easy quests just don't pose the same mental engagement as the moderate to difficult quests.\n\n \n\nand i certainly think it's a balancing act that FFG has to play here. quests can't be so hard that new players can't jump in at any point but also different/unique/challenging enough that players from the beginning aren't bored and stop playing.\n\n \n\ni don't envy FFGs task at all... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nEdited August 6, 2013 by Dain Ironfoot"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87670-nigthmare-mode-epic-fail/?do=findComment&comment=832997","commentId":832997,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1375837128,"content":"on a side note, got my nightmare decks in today. beat passage through mirkwood (not easily) and lost journey down the anduin, didnt even attempt dol guldur.  used an outlands deck too.\n\n \n\nsome of the art on the new encounter cards is just gruesome and awesome. the crazed prisoner and forest flies in particular are great.  the new ungoliant's spawn looks far more vicious now too"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87670-nigthmare-mode-epic-fail/?do=findComment&comment=833079","commentId":833079,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1375846225,"content":"> on a side note, got my nightmare decks in today. beat passage through mirkwood (not easily) and lost journey down the anduin, didnt even attempt dol guldur.  used an outlands deck too.\n> \n>  \n> \n> some of the art on the new encounter cards is just gruesome and awesome. the crazed prisoner and forest flies in particular are great.  the new ungoliant's spawn looks far more vicious now too\n\nTry PTM again.
