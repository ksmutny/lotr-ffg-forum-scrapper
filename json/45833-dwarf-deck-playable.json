Not having Legolas will hurt but with Celeborn's stone and allies with Willpower you will be able to make up for that. It will probably still be tough questing but it should definitely be easier then mono-tactics. You will probably need to include non-dwarves like Faramir and Guard of the Citadel just for their Willpower.\n\nHowever I haven't tried it out so these are just guesses on my part. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45833-dwarf-deck-playable/?do=findComment&comment=459575","commentId":459575,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1303845279,"content":"What do you mean by playable? I have played most of my games with an all dwarf deck, and it performs beautifully. However, I have been playing into two person games. The deck struggles against certain scenarios, particularly location dependent ones."}]}
