I finally get my beloved copy of the game. I take off the shrink wrap and grin over the premium contents.\n\nThe very first thing I do is pick up the rulebook and thumb through it..  only to discover 8 pages are in another language. Printer error. Not just a mistake in putting the books together, but a true printing error. English on one side of a page and spanish on the other.\n\nAnd I'm not knocking spanish, I'm sure it's a lovely language I don't know how to read.\n\nI know I can print out the missing pages, and I'm doing that as I type this. I also believe that if I contact FFG, they'll send me a copy all in english. But all that aside, you know my intitial reaction? I put the cover back on the box, went out and got some chinese take-out and watched some tv for a while.  sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]\n\n \n\nNow I'm finally taking a look at it. I hope all the cards are in a language I can read."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45598-quality-control-my-very-first-impression-is-my-rulebook-has-8-pages-in-spanish/?do=findComment&comment=457363","commentId":457363,"userName":"Darksbane","timestamp":1303432250,"content":"Apparently this is a pretty common problem.
