The game on itself doesn't needs anything, if they stop releasing packs right now - players will be good for years with the content games has. It's about what would be cool. And mechanic similar to Madness would definitely be cool, because it's insanely interactive and allows for some crazy shenanigans and game design twists, not to mention the whole thing of turning a downside into the upside.\n\nEdited August 12, 2016 by John Constantine"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227495-madness-an-mtg-keyword-that-would-feel-itself-right-at-home-within-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2362386","commentId":2362386,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1471031118,"content":"I wouldn't have an issue with something like this.

When a new mechanic is introduced into the game, if it's consistent enough - it's only natural to turn it into the keyword rather than print that long same description on dozens of different cards.\n\n \n\nAnd, by the way, this thread is not about whether this game should have more keywords or not, so I would appreciate that if you won't continue posting here regarding this subject.\n\nEdited August 13, 2016 by John Constantine"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227495-madness-an-mtg-keyword-that-would-feel-itself-right-at-home-within-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2362564","commentId":2362564,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1471035457,"content":"Putting the dispute over the number of keywords aside (and recognizing that it has been around a long time), I think it's a great idea.  But since there isn't a stack in LOTR it isn't that different from \"Play this card from your discard pile\" is it?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227495-madness-an-mtg-keyword-that-would-feel-itself-right-at-home-within-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2362621","commentId":2362621,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1471036933,"content":"Why make Noldor more complicated & powerful?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227495-madness-an-mtg-keyword-that-would-feel-itself-right-at-home-within-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2363176","commentId":2363176,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1471066341,"content":"> Putting the dispute over the number of keywords aside (and recognizing that it has been around a long time), I think it's a great idea.  But since there isn't a stack in LOTR it isn't that different from \"Play this card from your discard pile\" is it?\n\n \n\nExcellent point: we effectively already have the Madness keyword on Glorfindel, Lords of the Eldar, and Elven-light. The only difference is that in theory, a Madness cost could be different from the normal-play cost and/or give bonuses when used, and that simply would require extra card text on the current cards. (E.g., if Glorfindel were to get a bonus when being played from the discard pile, it could look like \"Glorfindel can be played from your discard pile. If you do so, his cost is 6, and he gains +1 Will / +1 Atk until the end of the round.\")"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227495-madness-an-mtg-keyword-that-would-feel-itself-right-at-home-within-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2363219","commentId":2363219,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1471071656,"content":"> But since there isn't a stack in LOTR it isn't that different from \"Play this card from your discard pile\" is it?\n\nNo. Let me explain the differences:\n\n \n\n1. The main difference. Cards that can be played from your discard pile - can be permanently played from your discard pile as long as they are in your discard pile. Madness cards can only be played at the time they get discarded from your hand, which introduces such aspects as windows of opportunity and resource management, absent from cards that just can be played from discard pile.\n\n \n\n2. Madness cost. Cards with Madness provide an unique design opportunity: you can alter their Madness cost from their printed cost (even without changing or adding anything else). An event may cost 2, but will cost 1 if played by Madness, etc.\n\n \n\n3. You can tie cool additional effects around Madness. You can make a strong card that can be played cheaper with Madness but will be weaker if done so. You can make all sorts of cool things you can't with the cards that just can be played from your discard pile (well, you can, but that will be much more drudging on the card text).\n\n \n\n \n\n> Why make Noldor more complicated & powerful?\n\nTo match the Outlands, obviously. Duh.\n\nEdited August 13, 2016 by John Constantine"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227495-madness-an-mtg-keyword-that-would-feel-itself-right-at-home-within-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2363294","commentId":2363294,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1471080233,"content":"Do you think \"Madness\" fits in with the LoTR tradition?
