If I have a Location in play with a value of 3 and get 5 explore tokens during the Quest Phase, do I clear the Location and put 2 on the Quest?  ...or do I lose the 2?\n\n2. If I have a Quest in play with a value of 3 and get 5 explore tokens during the Quest Phase, do I clear that Quest and put 2 on the next Quest?  ...or do I lose the 2?\n\n3. If I flip a Shadow Card during an enemy attack and it's a Treachery, do I ignore it?  ...or do I resolve the Treachery effect?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/261059-total-noob-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3030747","commentId":3030747,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1508269085,"content":"1. The additional progress is placed on the Quest. Note that you say that a Location is \"in play\" so it's worth clarifying: a location absorbs progress and is cleared only if it is the Active Location, i.e. you Traveled to it in the Travel phase in a previous turn. If the location is just sitting in the Staging Area, it doesn't absorb any progress but also doesn't get cleared.\n\n2. The additional progress is lost.\n\n3. You only pay attention to the shadow effect of the shadow card. If there is no shadow effect, the card does nothing. This is the case whether the card is a location, enemy, treachery or whatever.\n\nEdited October 17, 2017 by NathanH"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/261059-total-noob-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3032015","commentId":3032015,"userName":"KrisWall","timestamp":1508336462,"content":"> 18 hours ago, NathanH said:\n> \n> 1.

On the last point I will even say that generally, especially on the first cycle of the game, the best is to commit to the quest only to be sure to explore the active location (so you can travel) and try to kill all the enemies who show up during the first turns. Then you can quest with almost all your character because you will only have to deal with the future cards, and never suffer any interaction between encounter cards.\n\nOn a more short way: First clean the staging area then think about pass the quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/261059-total-noob-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3032761","commentId":3032761,"userName":"KrisWall","timestamp":1508360013,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Rouxxor said:\n> \n> Yes on all.
