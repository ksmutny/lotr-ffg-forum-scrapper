Not sure whether in the core expansion but the cycle won't end without that evil spirit of Udun rearing his flaming face. Their isn't even a relevance to Khazad-Dum without him.\n\nOn the expansion page it says that we look for Balin. Well, he lead a colony there and hans't been heard from since. The reason he even went there is because Khazad-Dum has been empty of Dwarves since the Balrog ran them out.\n\nSo, an emphatic YES to Balrog in the expansion!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54173-balrog-or-no-in-kazhad/?do=findComment&comment=537225","commentId":537225,"userName":"Maniacske","timestamp":1317783002,"content":"I hope we'll see the Goblin King too in the near future :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54173-balrog-or-no-in-kazhad/?do=findComment&comment=537231","commentId":537231,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1317784730,"content":"Frayed said:\n\nThere has to be a balrog.  That'd be like having an expansion box on Fangorn and not having an Ent.\n\n \n\nAgreed, and I think the idea of the watcher in the water is also cool, be interesting to see if that is in there as well. Still to not have the Balrog would not be a pleasant surprise.\n\nI think it will be interesting to see how it works, as thematically, there should be no way to fight this card. I am thinking it is going to be some kind of card that sits in the staging area and we have to \"run\" away from, slowly collecting tokens or something, when a amount is reached, we all die.
