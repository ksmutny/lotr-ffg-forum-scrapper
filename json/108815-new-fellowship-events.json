Players do not need to play The Old Forest before participating in October’s Fellowship Event. However, both The Old Forestand Fog on the Barrow-downs were designed so that they can be played with The Black Riders Saga Expansion in campaign mode, and come with new Boon and Campaign Mode setup cards.

On the one hand, FFG are pretty good about minimizing exclusives compared to other companies and making sure that completionists are happy. On the other hand, they have to provide incentives to actually get players to participate in these events. This is especially difficult for LOTR, where there are no tournaments/glory to provide a draw. Instead, this type of exclusive swag seems like their best bet to rope people in. Alternate art cards are a good solution, as you're not giving players anything \"new\" in terms of a brand new card, rather just an alternate version of an existing card. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108815-new-fellowship-events/?do=findComment&comment=1124292","commentId":1124292,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1403026435,"content":"Wow, how great is this news?\n\nI love that it's usable in campaign mode!!!\n\nSeems like FFG really does listen to our suggestions!\n\nAlso, this might be a bit of a dumb question, but are oversea retailers allowed to order these?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108815-new-fellowship-events/?do=findComment&comment=1124313","commentId":1124313,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1403027810,"content":"> i agree with trololo - nice art, but im pleased that is design (layout etc) is an alternate version, not the usual version.\n\n \n\n> I like the art, I do not like the design of the card.

I think that if we have great art, it should be shown off as much as possible and the card text and such should be minimally designed.
