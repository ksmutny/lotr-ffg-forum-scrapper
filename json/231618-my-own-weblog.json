I want to log all my quests with all the avalaible heroes (and stop waiting more than 1 year for logging something with Damrod, for example).\n\nI'm learning php, i will end this weblog not fast. However i like it.\n\n \n\nAs i said, it is for my own use. In fact, ringsdb is working on a amazing weblog. I'm waiting for it, however im logging my scores on my personal weblog because i'd rather on it instead on post-its papers.\n\n \n\nI open this thread because i'm satisfied about my php knowledges ^^. But i know i dont have enough knowledges to build a professional weblog public, for example, about security ways. Php is weak in that theme, and i know i am not a professional about it, a easy hacker could ruin my database, and people that trust me could become frustrated. I prefer it for my personal localhost.\n\nEdited October 4, 2016 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231618-my-own-weblog/?do=findComment&comment=2442510","commentId":2442510,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1475597973,"content":"You can learn php, css, javascript+jquery, ajax and html all by yourself and making a pretty decent job in the end, so keep it up.\n\nSomething that starts as a tool you find useful for yourself in the first place is bound to be useful for someone else."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231618-my-own-weblog/?do=findComment&comment=2442691","commentId":2442691,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1475603637,"content":"Sure, i could share the work when i finish it"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231618-my-own-weblog/?do=findComment&comment=2445605","commentId":2445605,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1475765464,"content":"I'm doing the work ahead.... this is how it displays atm:\n\n \n\nycEJEcM.jpg [http://i.imgur.com/ycEJEcM.jpg]\n\n \n\nEach time it is being more similar than original ^^."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231618-my-own-weblog/?do=findComment&comment=2454020","commentId":2454020,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1476301935,"content":"After hcores is ended, working now on stadistics:\n\n \n\nScS64QR.jpg [http://i.imgur.com/ScS64QR.jpg]\n\nEdited October 12, 2016 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231618-my-own-weblog/?do=findComment&comment=2457725","commentId":2457725,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1476480899,"content":"Stadistics ended:\n\n \n\nOgRP3Ig.jpg [http://i.imgur.com/OgRP3Ig.jpg]\n\n \n\nIt just needs some html work, but php (the most hard) is ended yet.\n\n \n\nGoing for.... mmmmmh, let's go to compare different players' score!\n\nEdited October 14, 2016 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231618-my-own-weblog/?do=findComment&comment=2461819","commentId":2461819,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1476745094,"content":"Comparison section is done!!!\n\n \n\ngqDfIbR.jpg [http://i.imgur.com/gqDfIbR.jpg]\n\n \n\nI return to say: design is not the main important, it is the php.
