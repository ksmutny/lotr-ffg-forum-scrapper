Not long had the base set and loving it already. Newb question. If I defeat an enemy or successfully travel to a location is that card removed from the game or placed in the discard pile? Same question for defeated heroes and allies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193095-defeated-enemiesalliesheroes-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1888267","commentId":1888267,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1447175968,"content":"All defeated cards leave play by going to their discard pile.\n\nCards with victory and specifically written effect are the only exception."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193095-defeated-enemiesalliesheroes-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1889253","commentId":1889253,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1447227414,"content":"Note that traveling to a location and exploring it are two very different things.
