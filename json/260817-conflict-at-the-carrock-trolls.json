Could I search in the discard and encounter decks for 1 Sacked! card? or does the text refer to Sacked! cards in play?\n\n2. Is the discarded card put out of play or in the discard pile?\n\nRegards,\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/260817-conflict-at-the-carrock-trolls/?do=findComment&comment=3025749","commentId":3025749,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1507983529,"content":"Cards in the encounter deck or discard pile are not in play, and the card is put in the discard pile (when a card is put out of play, it is normally phrased like ''put the x card out of play''). ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nCheers!"}]}
