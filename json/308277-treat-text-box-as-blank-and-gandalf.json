So that once you play Elfhelm he is now \"in play\", and therefore the burden also affects him.

(Should also apply to Elrond and Galadriel allies.)\n\nAFAIK, the player gets to choose the order. But I could be wrong. I shall go and have a look to see if I can find out...\n\n(Incidentally, I lost the game two turns after the above dilemma came up. I suddenly drew a slew of bad encounter cards, which forced two great-cave trolls and some orcs to engage me at once and wipe me out.

From the FAQ:\n \n\n> Quote\n> \n> (1.55) Lasting Effects\n> \n>  \n> \n> There are two classes of lasting effects in the game: those created by player cards and those created by encounter cards. Each class is handled differently as follows:\n> \n> [...]\n> \n> A lasting effect created by an encounter card ability, is recalculated if the game state changes.\n> \n>  \n\nAnd it goes on to cite an example of a treachery that blanks the text box of any ally with damage placed on it, an effect which lasts until the end of the combat phase (rather than the round, but much the same effect here). If an ally takes damage, the text box is blanked, if it is completely healed, then it unblanks.\n\nSo, as I understand this: Any sneak attacked ally will have its text box blanked by the burden discussed in the OP, since it becomes \"in play\" (the game state has changed, and the effect is recalculated), and the same applies to Elfhelm, who then avoids being discarded at the end of the phase he was played and is not discarded in the same way Core Gandalf would be (since Elfhelm would ordinarily be discarded at the end of the phase rather then the end of the round).\n\nEdited May 9 by steve83"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308277-treat-text-box-as-blank-and-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=3937019","commentId":3937019,"userName":"Adaepholn","timestamp":1589050201,"content":"Thanks, that example is good.
