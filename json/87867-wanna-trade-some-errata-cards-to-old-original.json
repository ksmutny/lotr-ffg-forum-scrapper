I had it and sold it when I thought I wouldn't play anymore and now it impossible to get a new pre 2012 edition.\n\nSo, since the cards that has been updated are cards that probably won't see much play for those with a second and third core set I thought that I might be able to trade them.\n\nI'm only interested in the few cards that have been errata'ed, that is, I would like to trade the new corrected edition ones I have for the old original ones. The cards must be mint or in a condition that you can't see they have been used.\n\nThe cards are these:\n\nDol Guldur Beastmaster x 2\n\nNazg√ªl of Dol Guldur x 1\n\nThe Necromancer's Tower quest card 1\n\nSo in all it's only 4 cards. I know, it's a little sad but when I first got an idea I can't let it go.\n\nIf anyone are interested let me know. Either here or PM me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87867-wanna-trade-some-errata-cards-to-old-original/?do=findComment&comment=837541","commentId":837541,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1376320489,"content":"Really?
