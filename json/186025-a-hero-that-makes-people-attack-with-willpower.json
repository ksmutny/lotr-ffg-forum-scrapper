(Eomer 1, Beorn's 0, and T Aragorn's 2). Even if you include other Tactics allies, combined WP for questing will not be that much different. Bottomline, either these 3 heroes quest for 3 or attack for 14.\n\n \n\nWhereas a hero that uses WP as attack strength, could easily have combined Willpower of 10+ in the 1st round (even without allies) (Eowyn's 4+ WP, Glorfindel's 3 WP, and any other hero with 3+WP) to quest OR use that 10+ WP as attack strength.  That flexibility of having 10+ WP for questing OR for attacking makes a hero with static ability of using WP as attack very overpowered.\n\n \n\nBesides, we already have a similar Spirit Event card \"Ride them down\" that kind of does what you propose: in essence using WP as damage."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186025-a-hero-that-makes-people-attack-with-willpower/?do=findComment&comment=1753557","commentId":1753557,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1440487765,"content":"That was kinda the point?
