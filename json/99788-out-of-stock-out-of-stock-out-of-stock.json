On a quick glance they have some (but not all) of the sets you name in stock [including The Hobbit part 1, which is a good place to start if you just have the Core Set], and they aren't overcharging. I've always found them very reliable.\n\nEdited February 21, 2014 by jjeagle"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99788-out-of-stock-out-of-stock-out-of-stock/?do=findComment&comment=991650","commentId":991650,"userName":"camacazio","timestamp":1393008447,"content":"This issue comes up a lot. Might be worth having a thread or notice to this affect pinned somewhere. Anywho, check with your local game store; they often have some stock that lasts longer than the internet, and it's good to support a local gaming spot. I don't know timing for crossing the pond, but yeah; I recently got redhorn gate and road to rivendell on reprint, they come around regularly.\n\n \n\nIt is worth pointing out that they design every new box set with a new player in mind. If you have a core set and get the new Voice of Isengard, and get the adventure packs that come out using this deluxe expansion, then you will be very well equipped for the quests in this new cycle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99788-out-of-stock-out-of-stock-out-of-stock/?do=findComment&comment=991665","commentId":991665,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1393009202,"content":"> I'm in the UK.
