I assume they want the core. \n\nIf it is adviced to try them out, should I go 1st with hobbit, which 8m inclined to do, or the Lord of the rings. \n\nThanks. \n\n \n\nSorry about all the short forms.

You can buy On the Doorstep for instance and play that with just the Core. The Sagas are meant to be played in order because they follow the narratives of the books. But if you're familiar with the books already then you can play the Sagas in any order. Campaign play on-the-other-hand is different and will require playing them in order.\n\nEdited May 20, 2018 by stimpaksam"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276231-go-saga/?do=findComment&comment=3340403","commentId":3340403,"userName":"Ceahorse","timestamp":1526794449,"content":"Is there more narrative than what I have already seen?
