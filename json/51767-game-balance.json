We already discuss that problem unbalanced game before. So trust me  now with 3 more quests game start to be more balanced than before anyway.\n\nBut still more players more easy to play.

This way for a 3 player game it would look like: 3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6..\n\nI mean it's obvious the game is unbalanced - imagine a tower defender game when you are hit by 1 zombie all the time. Or imagine some rts, say Starcraft where AI sends 12 zerglings per minute from the edge of the map. It's like initial strike maybe can kill you but later you get some marines, after that siege tanks with siege mode(that would be Gandalf spam equivalent :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]) etc.\n\nI mean the encounter deck has to compensate for heroes' cards and heroes' resources. The future expansions will be done \"properly\" but the ones we have now can easily be fixed by some nice encounter cards drawing algorithm - no need to make oneselves bored after the first few turns.\n\nSo I'd suggest this for 3 players:\n\nDraw 3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6..\n\nIf Gandalf is played immediately add 1 encounter card for the next turn.

So the game isn't too easy, you've just included enough copies of the core cards to make it easier. That's not a problem with game balance, that's a player made problem. With x3 of every Core card you should be doing the variation where you play through the quests in order without resetting your threat, because that's the level you've set the game at by using multiple Core Sets.\n\nWith one Core Set, Escape from Dol Guldur is plenty of challenge for the money spent.

I'm sure some more 9s or even higher will come out eventually. But right now I think they are trying to appeal to as many players as possible to get the game out there. I've shown the game to a half dozen people so far and I think they liked it unless they were just being nice and didn't want to hurt my feelings. With some fairly easy and moderate quests, it is easier to entertain new players. People generally want to win or else the experience is not fun for them. The harder stuff can come later when the game has a following and people have gotten the hang of it.\n\nI have a feeling LOTR LCG has a good chance of going the distance. People start getting frustrated playing each other over and over in Game of Thrones, etc. and then they can take a break and relax and co-op with LOTR and Star Wars LCG and be friends again.  : )\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51767-game-balance/?do=findComment&comment=517350","commentId":517350,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1313804424,"content":"Actually game balance in core set was not so good. All 3 quest was quite easy to defeated if you start to use 50 cards expert decks. But with mono deck game is still challenge.\n\nSo now things start to change step by step. New quest difficult 7 or 9 and i hope Rosgobel will be not less than 6. So if you play Massing in Osgiliath forget starter mono decks. So now we really need to build up 50 cards expert decks. And i m sure Return to Mirkwood and Death marches will be also very difficult maybe 8-9 or even 10. The last quest in the cycle should be most hard. New player cards give us more opportunity to build up the decks so encounter cards also grow more strong. Last 2 months was really boring with all this delay but now lot of action come.
