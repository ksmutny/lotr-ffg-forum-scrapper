There just aren't many other candidates from that portion of the story.\n\n \n\nBut what heroes will be released in the last two saga boxes that will cover the events of Return of the King? Who are the options? If we assume that we'll get two heroes per saga box, and that the creators won't make alternates of core set heroes, then the choices are rather limited.\n\n \n\nIf they want to make alternates for non-core heroes, then they have several options: Imrahil, Halbarad, Hirluin, Erkenbrand, Elrohir, Elladan, Eomer, Beregond, Hama. \n\n \n\nBut if they want to make new heroes, they have few characters left to choose from: Gamling and Gwaihir are about the only ones I can imagine. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Land of Shadow\nHero 1         Faramir\nHero 2         Damrod/Anborn\n \nRotK Part One (Paths of the Dead, Pelargir, Siege of Minas Tirith, Pelennor Fields)\n * Imrahil helps lead the defense of Minas Tirith, and charges onto Pelennor Fields. His hero card was released early in the game's history, and I can imagine him getting a Spirit or Tactics alternate. \n * Halbarad was released very recently, and I already love his ability. No call for a new version. \n * Hirluin could get a non-Outlands iteration, but I honestly don't think he'll be chosen before Imrahil. \n * Eomer leads the Rohirrim after Theoden's death, and becomes king. Like Imrahil, he shines in the final battles. He certainly deserves a new version more than most.\n * Beregond, Hama, and Erkenbrand are all involved in the battles, but I don't see them getting alternates before Imrahil and Eomer. \n * Elladan and Elrohir join Aragorn for the Paths of the Dead. They could get Spirit and Lore version, that have a similar mechanic to their current version. I honestly hope they don't bother with this, though. \n * Gamling is, to my mind, one of the last few notable characters that doesn't have a player card. He is by no means a crucial hero, but I think it would be fitting to introduce a new Rohan hero for Pelennor Fields.\n\nHero 1          Imrahil\n\nHero 2\n\n \n \nRotK Part Two (Morannon, Cirith Ungol? The Shire? Will Frodo and Aragorn's stories converge?)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182675-upcoming-saga-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=1694943","commentId":1694943,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1437120036,"content":"Fair guesses. Regarding RotK part 2, shouldn't Cirith Ungol be in The Land of Shadow already? Frodo's and Sam's journey in RotK is basically a drag across Gorgoroth and up the slopes of Orodruin, and then home to the Shire."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182675-upcoming-saga-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=1694947","commentId":1694947,"userName":"pmdoug","timestamp":1437120434,"content":"RotK Part Two\n\n * Imrahil and Eomer could also be heroes here. \n * Gwaihir and his eagles play a big part in the Battle of Morannon and in saving the hobbits. I realize that making a giant winged hero is asking for trouble, but they made Treebeard and Beorn work. And if players want to have Gwaihir get into a fist fight in The Leaping Fish, so be it. \n\nHero 1         Eomer\n\nHero 2         Gwaihir\n\n \n\n \n\nI'd still prefer Lore Gimli and Spirit Legolas over any of the above, but I imagine they'll be released outside the saga.

I see we might see no allies whatsoever here.\n\n \n\nBox V: This is difficult. Imrahil is a given but will he be hero or ally? Beregond the same thing, none of them are in either core or saga yet, so we will see them. A given hero is Éomer. Denethor should feature, probably as an ally since he is a hero in the core. And then my big hopes go for Merry and Pippin allies. I hope Merry is Spirit and has the Rohan trait also, and Pippin is Leadership and Gondor (as well as Hobbit, of course). Maybe the trait thing is a bit too much because one can get them through other card effects but I feel it would be neat.\n\nSo: Éomer (Leadership hero), Imrahil (Spirit hero), Denethor (Lore ally), Beregond (Tactics ally), Merry (Spirit ally), Pippin (Leadership ally).\n\n \n\nBox VI: No idea. Perhaps no heroes, similar to the Road Darkens. I hope to see Meneldor as an Eagle Tactics ally. Perhaps some gets another version? Doubt it though. We can get many events instead."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182675-upcoming-saga-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=1694967","commentId":1694967,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1437123890,"content":"The Road Darmens featured Gandalf hero.

I sort of hope we get 4 in Box V but I think it will be just two: 4, 1, 2, 2, 2 and 0 = 11 heroes plus 12 in the core for those who only follow the saga.\n\nEdited July 17, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182675-upcoming-saga-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=1694988","commentId":1694988,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1437126361,"content":"Though, now that I look at it 13 heroes would make more sense: 3 of each sphere and Gandalf without a sphere.

The designers have said the Saga line is developped outside of the rest of the product line, with each box including Heroes and Allies that makes thematic sense.\n\n \n\nIt is absolutely certain we will get a Faramir in LOS, an Eomer in Box#5 or #6. I think we'are getting 6 more heroes total in the last 3 boxes, so there's room for another 4-hero guess.\n\n \n\nI also think the second ranger will be Damrod. Then, my money is on Imrahil for box 5 and Gwaihir for box 6. Those characters seems to be the most iconic ones.\n\n \n\nAs for the last hero, I really think we'll get... Frodo Baggins. Because I think we'll get Sam as the Fellowship hero with the Ring-bearer trait in box #6. And if players decide then to choose Sam as their Ring-bearer during the whole campaign, they have the possibility to play Frodo, as a non-fellowship hero.\n\n \n\nSo I'm saying: Faramir, Damrod, Imrahil, Eomer, Gwaihir and Frodo.\n\nEdited July 17, 2015 by banania"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182675-upcoming-saga-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=1695209","commentId":1695209,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1437143400,"content":"omg!  guys you are forgetting so many peps!  Don't you think that...

I think they want to release all the big characters in the saga, one way or another. So those who are heroes in the core, like Legolas or Gimli, will get an ally treatment in the saga. Aragorn is an exception, probably, since he is a Fellowship hero for Treason (and maybe for box V as well). But I am almost positive we shall see Denethor ally, and probably Ěowyn ally as well in the box V.\n\n \n\nThat Frodo call is interesting. Perhaps it may happen like that. We may get Ring-bearer Sam and one will be able to choose either Frodo or Sam as the Fellowship hero and the other (if he wants) as a line-up hero.\n\n \n\nI further agree (as I have been already changing my mind above) that we shall see six more heroes, for the total of 13: 3 for each sphere and Gandalf.\n\n \n\nThat would leave only one more Lore and one more Spirit hero, two more for both Leadership and Tactics.
