Oh, well. IIRC, the ruling went that woodman’s path was like  a constant ability, so the location would be kept st one quest point even if other cards increased it.\n\nEveryone, correct me if I imagined the thread, and please post it  if you find it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297120-elf-stone-and-woodmens-path/?do=findComment&comment=3734509","commentId":3734509,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1562252475,"content":"> 3 hours ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> . IIRC, the ruling went that woodman’s path was like  a constant ability, so the location would be kept st one quest point even if other cards increased it.\n\nMy doubt was that also Elf-Stone functions as a constant ability but I was unsure if the usual \"for effect with the same timing/conditions the first players chooses the order into which apply them\" was in effect or not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297120-elf-stone-and-woodmens-path/?do=findComment&comment=3734549","commentId":3734549,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1562258684,"content":"In my mind Woodman's Path functions a bit like Vanish from Sight.

If multiple set modifiers are in conflict, the most recently resolved set modifier takes precedence.\"\n\nI think because Woodmen's Path \"sets\" the quests points to a specific number, in this case  1,  it takes precedence over Elf-stone because Elf-stone only adds +1."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297120-elf-stone-and-woodmens-path/?do=findComment&comment=3734584","commentId":3734584,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1562262342,"content":"Previous discussion here.
