Tonski, at the end of the game said that Wandering Took must be faqqed. I answered: 'are you saying Pippin is overpowered?' ^^\n\n \n\nEarendil-Took decrease the threat of the silvan-player. Haldir can use his ability always then. And Pippin avoid enemies while i get pipes and hobbit senses.\n\n \n\nIn this game i had to use Pippin ability several times, Haldir had no weapons, so combat was slow. We win finally.\n\n \n\nThe question is: first time i see Pippin's ability usefull.\n\n \n\nI post here this thread, because i dont list the deck. However, if you want to see it, here is the link: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/880/hobbit-spirit-2.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/880/hobbit-spirit-2.0]\n\n \n\nPD: When i finally got 3 Hobbit Senses, i decreased the mate's trheat down to 0 (raising mine a lot), and i engaged all enemies, the last rounds, when it was sure we win the scenario with our willpower, at least, during 2 rounds.\n\nEdited April 20, 2016 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217894-spirit-pippin-overpowered/?do=findComment&comment=2179503","commentId":2179503,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1461190263,"content":"You can answer in this picture: Naith Guide is ready to defend, so doesn't hurry Pippin's ability.\n\n \n\n--> Sure?

He has to raise his threat to take control of the Wandering Took. Isn't that contrary to what Haldir wants?

Still a lot of cards to get both your threats down to where you don't have to take any mandatory engagements, but seems like good cheeky fun.

You can't say it's overpowered and post a screenshot of one of the easiest quests in the game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. You are just killing 1 enemy each turn with Haldir so the enemies will pile up. If this were a different quest you could reveal 2-3 enemies with 20-30 engagement cost on the first turn. What then? You raise by 6 and let Haldir kill one... next turn you reveal another enemy, and must raise by 6 again.

My conclusion is he says spirit pippin is overpowered. Isn't? ^^\n\n \n\nAbout Seastan comments: well, this deck and spirit Pippin is not overpowered. Atm i have tried it in easy scenarios, the good new is that we have a good use and useful for spirit Pippin. The question is if it works in harder scenarios. This deck needs some round to build it, not always is perfect. I think the percentatge 1/5 is only the games that it crashes. I think it is a good average."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217894-spirit-pippin-overpowered/?do=findComment&comment=2180277","commentId":2180277,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1461248348,"content":"Oh I misunderstood whose threat was whose."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217894-spirit-pippin-overpowered/?do=findComment&comment=2180543","commentId":2180543,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1461254928,"content":"As a sometime Wandering Took-Song of Earendil player myself, I must say that I believe it to be one of the most abusable combos still legal in the game. (Hat tip to Boromir shenanigans, of course.) While it's great to see Spirit Pippin find some use, it probably falls on the other combo for whatever real power this deck may have."}]}
