Unfortunatly there are NO LCG players here in Tucson they all love playing MTG or hero clix. So I have to rely on Solo Play, I thought I read it once on this forums that there where rules for playing a solo game. Yes I know I could play on line, but I have a MAC and know way to play it on line. So could someone out there direct me to the rules for solo play I would love it. Thank you for your time\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89794-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=857720","commentId":857720,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1378319333,"content":"Hm, I'm not sure what you mean. There's no special rules for solo as this game is a 1-2 player game. All the rules are more or less intended for solo play and then you just add up depending how many players you are. Example, after committing characters to quest you deal one card from the encounter deck per player. That means 1 card in solo. The rules in the rule book are the ones you use for solo play. Hope it helps :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nAnd by the way the program lackeyccg runs in mac (using it myself) and has the best LotR lcg plugin. I use it mostly for solo play/double hand play but it really is developed with the online play in mind. You can find it on www.lackeyccg.com if you can't get a hold of the plugin I can help you with that but it should have been fixed by now"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89794-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=857816","commentId":857816,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1378327660,"content":"indeed, as mr.thomasschmidt says, this game is for 1-2 players (and 3-4 with a decent card pool)\n\n \n\ni can see how it may be confusing, the rule book doesnt really specify solo play differences\n\nrich"}]}
