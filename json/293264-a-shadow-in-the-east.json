Also, this new Master keyword could be some sort of Doomed reboot I was waiting for for a true Artifact theme/subarchetype. Here's hoping Caleb expands on the \"magic\", \"arts of the Enemy\" doom-y artifacts themes during this cycle, as it would fit it perfectly. The expansion itself, the art and story all excite me quite a bit (love the wild ox reference in the River Running art, as it was from hte wild oxen of Rhun that the Horn of Gondor was taken).

Didn't expect Smeagol hero, but man did they put effort into him. Even though I see myself flip the table once he betrays me in the first staging...\n\n\nHaving the one ring become a playable attachment is a thing you would't have done. As all other \"legendary\" objects (Sting etc.) it is in the possession of one person (if I get the timeline right it should be Bilbo). But ofc the game would only be have as fun if you couldn't make Boromir the Steward of Gondor or equip Legolas with Anduril, so in general I am fine with giving unique things to \"wrong\" characters. But this is the ONE ring. And it is so often defined as the pure evil that shouldn't be used, it feels wrong to have it as a player card and not as the thing a poor guy has to endure just long enough to destroy it. I am curious if there will be a penalty for \"overloading\" the ring carrier? As mentioned you loose if he dies/looses the ring. And the best way to keep someone alive in this game is to buff him up with attachments. Sure you can \"protect\" Spirit Pippin, who only carries the ring, but can die to one unlucky EC during during questing. Put it on Boromir with blood of numenor and fire of Gondor and you are unlikely to have him killed of and loose you the game, effectively doing what the \"canon\" tells not to do: Give the ring to the mighty and powerful. And use with the best intentions.\nAlso, why call it Master? Don't we all know there is only one Master of the ring?\n\nMechanics wise (without looking at lore aspects) this expansion seems to be on fire with the Smeagol hero, ring attachment and contracts. Looks like to biggest gameplay addition since side-quests.\n\n \n\nAnyone else excited to see an Indiana Jones reference in the temple of Doom quest? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293264-a-shadow-in-the-east/?do=findComment&comment=3666177","commentId":3666177,"userName":"JusticeLizard","timestamp":1554233530,"content":"> 12 minutes ago, Bullroarer Took said:\n> \n> Didn't Frodo have the ring then?  Bilbo left it behind and Frodo used it to escape being seen by the Sackville-Bagginses.  (As I recall.)\n\nYou can play him too.\n\nI wasn't sure if it was after the party or just after the Hobbit.\n\nEdited April 2, 2019 by JusticeLizard"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293264-a-shadow-in-the-east/?do=findComment&comment=3666184","commentId":3666184,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1554234122,"content":"I'm torn on this one.\n\nYesterday, I would have told you that the absolute worst thing you could do for this game (short of making Orc playable characters on the hero's side, perhaps) was to introduce a One Ring player card outside of the Saga expansions.

I trust his design instincts, and I trust that just like he came around to a different point of view, so can I. I hope so, at least.

We reached a peak insanity around the end of the Ring-maker cycle, with the Time mechanic being hard to keep track of, especially in a scenario like The Antlered Crown where so many different cards have time counters.

The ine we got is honestly very bad.

Both the contract dynamic and the master player cards add some new capabilities and deck building techniques.

I think Frodo fits well with his other fellow hobbit heroes and I would like to take some time play testing some decks with him. I'm a bit underwhelmed by Pippin -- seems like a weaker form of the the Sam hero, but I would rather play with the hero version. \n> \n> I wasnt planning on exploring the one ring dynamic so I'm a little disappointed many of the cards in the expansion surround the master element. That being said I'd rather that be the case than it appearing numerous times through the adventure packs.\n\nFor me it's the other way round. Why should I sneak in Merry, when Faramir does so usually better (more targets, less duration, but in most cases only the questing phase requires willpower). And if I plan on playing Hobbits without Lore but Tactis instead, ally Pippin is a great addition. 2 Willpower, readying and 2 Attack (4 with Tom in the first round) for only 2 ressources? Yes, please.\n\nI agree that this expansion is probably not suited for newer players."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293264-a-shadow-in-the-east/?do=findComment&comment=3723992","commentId":3723992,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1560963834,"content":"> 4 hours ago, rees263 said:\n> \n> That's how I'd play it.

Or just have extra unique allies of different types anyways and the first 9 make the fellowship."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293264-a-shadow-in-the-east/?do=findComment&comment=3743392","commentId":3743392,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1563548598,"content":"So I believe I saw someone say we are down to two more unspoiled cards.
