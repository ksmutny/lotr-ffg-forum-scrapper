With a Dagger of westernesse and sylvan blade, he's swinging for a total of 7 on his own, effectively.\n\n \n\nThe reference to Legolas attacking alongside is because they both have ranged.\n\nEdited August 18, 2014 by Boris_the_Dwarf"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113853-holy-haldir/?do=findComment&comment=1210710","commentId":1210710,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1408404251,"content":"> Picked up the new pack at GC Friday, thumbed through the cards, and celebrated the arrival of Haldir - the answer to a long-time challenge my wife and I have had in our hero distribution choices.

Insanely powerful (especially against quests that feature smaller to medium sized enemies and not just boss sized ones like trolls, guardians etc) in that not only can he eliminate enemies in staging but also enemies engaged with other players/decks and often when doing so he provides a feint effect stopping that enemy attacking that round resulting in less overall attacks needing to be defended. Just crazy good. I also use Legolas as well and man slapping a rivendell blade, dagger of westernesse and dunedain mark on each makes for two very skilled and versatile warriors!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113853-holy-haldir/?do=findComment&comment=1218743","commentId":1218743,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1408706477,"content":"You engaging an enemy and an enemy engaging you have been considered the same thing in this game so does that mean if an enemy engages you you then can't use his ability?
