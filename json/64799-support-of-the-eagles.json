Still there is no tap effect or anything on these eagles. So while support can only be triggered once a phase … multiple copies can be triggered of the same eagle. So the goal of the eagle deck is to get eagles of the misty mountains [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/return-to-mirkwood/eagles-of-the-misty-mountains-rtm] in play, and have the other eagles go out of play and added as tokens to EotMM. This can add up very quickly.\n\nSo you have EotMM and it is say a 5(a)4(d) though you can get it way way higher… you can defend with it or attack, and still buff your attack hero with Support of the Eagles and your defence hero with its own Support of the Eagles [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/return-to-mirkwood/support-of-the-eagles-rtm] card\n\nThis is a extremely powerful attachment."}]}
