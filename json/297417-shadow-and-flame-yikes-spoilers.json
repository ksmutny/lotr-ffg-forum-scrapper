This can be achieved by both damaging a lot Durin's Bane so that even with Regenerate he still has 3 or less Hit Points remaining in the Refresh Phase or also by ensuring the three cards are high in price (doable in various ways) so that even if it has still 8-9 Hit Points left you can still throw it in the pit.\n\n> 1 hour ago, tripecac said:\n> \n> If that's right, then my decks (or my playing style) at this point have zero chance of beating this scenario.  I just can't get allies out fast enough to (1) chump block his attacks and (2) attack him back.  I can't even handle that first part (chump blockers), let alone attacking back.  In both games, I got a maximum of 4 damage on Durin's Bane (which  healed in 2 turns).  Sigh.\n> \n> I tried Frodo in the 2nd game.  He reduced the need for chumps, but eventually that player threated out.  The sword which gives +3 attack to Durin's Bane hastened the end.\n\nOne way is using a lot of threat reduction, staying at 0 threat (let's say Galadriel) until you have established a good board presence and only then engage Durin's Bane. Another way is repeated attack cancellation (like Hama for example).\n\nAnyway if you give us more information on your playing style, deck and available cardpool we might be able to help you more accurately."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297417-shadow-and-flame-yikes-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=3739091","commentId":3739091,"userName":"Dobrobass","timestamp":1562969804,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Onidsen said:\n> \n> There is an easy solution - in fact, the quest could be called broken.
