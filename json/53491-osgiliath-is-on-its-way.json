Go figure. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I actually like the quality of the POD cards better than the others, mainly because it has a glossy feel to them instead of the normal \"you know this is cardboard feel\" of the original cards. The gloss finish does make the cards slightly lighter than the others, but you only use this encounter deck for this quest, so that's a non-issue (unless you use them for a custom scenario in conjunction for other encounter cards). I'm actually very pleased with this. This is my first experience with POD and I like a lot so far. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53491-osgiliath-is-on-its-way/?do=findComment&comment=536486","commentId":536486,"userName":"Ohnomycocoa","timestamp":1317661501,"content":"Cletus said:\n\ntimbolton said:\n\n \n\nHas anyone who lives in Europe/UK who has ordered Osgiliath got it as yet?
