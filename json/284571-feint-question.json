(Once the act of resolving an enemy’s attack begins, it is too late to prevent it from attacking with Feint.)\n\nIt's clear.\n\nBut is the shadow card dealt?, I understand that it wouldn't be resolved.\n\nRegards,\n\nEdited October 15, 2018 by caribecards"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284571-feint-question/?do=findComment&comment=3503736","commentId":3503736,"userName":"Seosaidh","timestamp":1539602342,"content":"Yes, the shadow card is dealt. This can either be a great help if the shadow card was nasty and/or had a nasty effect if it entered the staging area during questing, or it could be bad if it wasn't a bad encounter card or if it was one of the player encounter cards (the Dunedain, the Ship, or the Eagle)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284571-feint-question/?do=findComment&comment=3503745","commentId":3503745,"userName":"caribecards","timestamp":1539603131,"content":"Hi,\n\nThanks for your answer, I think it's important to know if the shadow card is dealt because it could be an objective (I had the case) or something important in the game and it would be lost.\n\nThe rule to deal the shadow card is a little unclear in this case because if the enemy doesn't attack the shadow card shouldn't be dealt.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284571-feint-question/?do=findComment&comment=3503908","commentId":3503908,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1539612192,"content":"Shadow cards are dealt right at the start of the combat phase, before you have an action window to play Feint.

First time posting here, I'm having a great time playing this game, but I have a questions regarding Feint.
