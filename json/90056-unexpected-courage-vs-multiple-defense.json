You can ready it again but it is still considered defending, questing whatever. So, if you quest and ready the character again it cannot commit once more in that same quest phase. How about defense? It says that a character is only considered defending for the remaining of the attack but is that the attack from that particular enemy or the whole enemy attacking phase? I know you can defense then ready and use same character for attack. But how about multiple defense? This game really screws my brain sometimes :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90056-unexpected-courage-vs-multiple-defense/?do=findComment&comment=861220","commentId":861220,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1378728205,"content":"i have always played it so you can multi defend. i think if you take behind strong walls as an example- that card is meant of course for multi defending of the same character as it readies and give +1 defense\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90056-unexpected-courage-vs-multiple-defense/?do=findComment&comment=861240","commentId":861240,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1378729580,"content":"Good point :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] that cleared that :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] thanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90056-unexpected-courage-vs-multiple-defense/?do=findComment&comment=865086","commentId":865086,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1379060625,"content":"I didn't know this!
