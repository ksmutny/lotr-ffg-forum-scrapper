I used Thalin (to get rid of the crows), Eowyn, and Hama with Eagles. My friend (Couve_Timber) used Legolas, Beravor, and Frodo. We managed to find the Key and explore the cave one turn before killing the biggest troll. Felt great, so we moved on to the goblins, and got creamed. Anyone else find the treasure yet?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80665-finally-found-the-treasure/?do=findComment&comment=773072","commentId":773072,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1363108812,"content":"What are you talking about?

I've found this quest to be much easier multiplayer. Just the opposite for Down to Goblin Town though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80665-finally-found-the-treasure/?do=findComment&comment=773221","commentId":773221,"userName":"Cutievalkyrie","timestamp":1363137941,"content":"i didnt find the treasure but made the quest…"}]}
