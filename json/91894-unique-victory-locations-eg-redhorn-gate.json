When you finish exploring one it goes to the victory display (out of play) then when you are instructed to make it the active location it re-enters play. Then when you finish it again, you add it again to the victory display.\n\nEdited October 11, 2013 by Djenni"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91894-unique-victory-locations-eg-redhorn-gate/?do=findComment&comment=886469","commentId":886469,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1381489317,"content":"... but you only count its victory points once?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91894-unique-victory-locations-eg-redhorn-gate/?do=findComment&comment=886568","commentId":886568,"userName":"Djenni","timestamp":1381500905,"content":"> ... but you only count its victory points once?\n\nYes you only count your victory points once when you have won the quest at the end of the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91894-unique-victory-locations-eg-redhorn-gate/?do=findComment&comment=886667","commentId":886667,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1381509391,"content":"I think I understand my confusion.  I was playing OCTGN and was pretty sure that I found (and explored) 2 of the same victory location.  When I look at the Redhorn Gate card list here [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/the-redhorn-gate/] it looks like I should not have found any duplicates of those unique locations.\n\n \n\nSo I think one of the following happened:\n\n \n\na) Some bug in OCTGN duplicated one or more cards  (does this ever happen???)\n\n \n\nb) I accidentally load the same encounter deck twice (though I doubt it)\n\n \n\nc) I confused two similar 3-threat/7-progress unique locations\n\n \n\n \n\nI wish OCTGN had a save feature so that I could find out what happened!"}]}
