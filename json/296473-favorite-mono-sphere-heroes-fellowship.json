It's a bit like a weak dwarf deck, but fun non the less. Ofc it gets destroyed by AoE damage and shadow cards that punish chumping. Sadly I think it is better to swap Faramir for Balin or Sam, but that makes it less thematic.\n\nIn multiplayer it was very fun to bring a full blown murder-tactics deck. It ran Beregond, Legolas and Bard. Had a ton of Weapons and ranged allies and a few defenders. Sure it didn't help with questing, threat or location-management at all, but enemies didn't stand a chance. A variation swapping Bard for Brand (yes this hero you got in hills of emyn muil) was also fun, getting another use out of a pumped up treebeard."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296473-favorite-mono-sphere-heroes-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=3723068","commentId":3723068,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1560871978,"content":"I misspelled it so much that it became a new character hahaha.

But that is a very thematic team there.\n\nWe have a lot of healing effects spread around the decks so Elrond's passive boost to healing is a huge boon to the Fellowship, often allowing us to take undefended attacks with less lasting effects, plus Elrond has really good stats and is a good secondary defender (especially with Burning Brand, even post errata) if Beregond is too busy (which even with a load of readying effects often happens). Other than that it's helpful to have a target in the mono Lore deck for Arwen's ability (Lore is always hungry for resources) and being able to play Lembas.\n\nEdited June 22, 2019 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296473-favorite-mono-sphere-heroes-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=3726238","commentId":3726238,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1561267130,"content":"> 19 hours ago, Alonewolf87 said:\n> \n> We have a lot of healing effects spread around the decks so Elrond's passive boost to healing is a huge boon to the Fellowship, often allowing us to take undefended attacks with less lasting effects, plus Elrond has really good stats and is a good secondary defender (especially with Burning Brand, even post errata) if Beregond is too busy (which even with a load of readying effects often happens).

Haha. All sound reasons though and he rocks, being able to pay for all colored allies is great too\n\nBecause I more often than not I would rather use his action to quest or defend (Light of Valinor is spoken for SpGlorfindel and all the other action advantage cards tend to end up on Beregond) than to use his ring to blindly play a card which quite often would have cost only 1 or 2 resources (there are some 3/4/5 cards in the deck but like only 6 in total). Sure I could start putting in more costly allies, more action advantage, the Stargazer and other ways to arrange my deck, but then instead of an healing/trap deck it would become a Vilya deck and I don't really like that idea since I would have to cut out most of the utility cards that make Lore so fun to play. And sure playing off sphere allies can be great, but since we already have three other mono sphere decks most of the good cards are already there and quite easier to play than through Elrond's resource pool/Vilya"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296473-favorite-mono-sphere-heroes-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=3726752","commentId":3726752,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1561378702,"content":"That's fair and he does work well for his other tricks as you pointed out.
