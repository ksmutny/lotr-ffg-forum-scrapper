Sure, I won't turn down a good player card or two, but I'm far more interested in the quest. For me, the APs are like full game expansions rather than the more traditional card game boosters, and I love seeing the new stuff we're given to overcome each month  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93181-morgul-vale-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=904246","commentId":904246,"userName":"ana4","timestamp":1383844122,"content":"> It is funny but most people on forum care a lot about players cards in AP.

Maybe it would be easier to accept not everyone is the same, there is nothing funny about it actually, it is natural. The fact you are in a minority makes you neither better nor worse.\n\nFor me, since I really like the quests in this cycle, much more than the previous, I am also really looking forward to have a new quest. But I do not see any point knowing the encounter cards before having them. Whilst knowing the player cards allows me to look for new strategies in deck-building.\n\nEdited November 7, 2013 by Ana"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93181-morgul-vale-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=904267","commentId":904267,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1383845865,"content":"> For me, since I really like the quests in this cycle, much more than the previous, I am also really looking forward to have a new quest.
