In Runebound, you are sometimes instructed to make Diplomacy checks, but on a small number of cards, you are instead direct to make a Displomacy check :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nDisplomacy has ever since entered my vocabulary as an antonym for Diplomacy.\n\nAs you'll notice, the Elrohir and Elladan typo is that Response is missing an S. As you'll also notice, Displomacy has been stuck with an uncalled-for S. At FFG, everything evens out in the end :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI agree that your BEST bet is to await a reprint. However, I also caution you that it is also a poor bet. FFG have always answered the adage \"if you didn't have time to do it right the first time, when will you have time to do it again?\" with \"never\". Expect any reprint to be exact copies of the original press.\n\nMy advice is to just get the packs when you want to, and if a fix is in fact made down the line, simply request replacement cards from FFG customer service. They're very good with honoring those kinds of request."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62953-has-anybody-received-redhorn-gate-or-road-to-rivendell-without-spelling-mistakes/?do=findComment&comment=617584","commentId":617584,"userName":"bitva","timestamp":1334403034,"content":"Double post since we are talking about twins here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62953-has-anybody-received-redhorn-gate-or-road-to-rivendell-without-spelling-mistakes/?do=findComment&comment=617609","commentId":617609,"userName":"Jacob5432","timestamp":1334411196,"content":"Hi,\n\nThanks for your replies.
