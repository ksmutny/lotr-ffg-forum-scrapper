So in theory, does this mean you can put a card such as Citadel Plate on a Winged Guardian? Or a Dwarven Axe to a Veteran Axehand?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74020-question-about-plundered-armory/?do=findComment&comment=721082","commentId":721082,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1352503317,"content":"The attachment must be attached to a legal target (e.g. if it says \"attach to a hero\" then you must attach it to a Hero but not an Ally).  Plundered Armoury only let you attach an attachment without paying its cost but would not ignore other restrictions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74020-question-about-plundered-armory/?do=findComment&comment=721091","commentId":721091,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1352509099,"content":" Ohhh.

In my copy of Khazad Dûm Plundered Armoury says: \"...each player may attach a Weapon or Armoury attachment from his hand....\". But when I look the Armoury attachments available, I found zero armoury cards (except http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?Trait=Armour [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?Trait=Armour], but it is impossible to play it, It is an Objective Card). Then I read the last FAQ, and there is none clarification. So I assume that there must be a mistake in the cards, and they Have to say Armor, instead of Armoury."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74020-question-about-plundered-armory/?do=findComment&comment=1902140","commentId":1902140,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1448056444,"content":"My copy of Khazad-dum says \"Weapon\" or \"Armour.\"  Maybe it's a typo on the card?
