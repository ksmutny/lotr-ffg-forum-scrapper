Is it possible to play with five players? Has anyone tried this?\n\nThanks for any help!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184144-5-players/?do=findComment&comment=1719964","commentId":1719964,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1438711964,"content":"You theoretically could for most quests.  Sometimes you need 1 encounter or quest card per player and there are only 4 available, but most of the time you technically could so it.  However, the game is most balanced for 2 players and often with 4 players some quests can become overly challenging or easy.  5 player would make only make the balance worse.\n\n \n\nSo yes, you could play with 5.  I would personally rather split into 2 games, but if you really want to play with 5 you could do it most of the time."}]}
