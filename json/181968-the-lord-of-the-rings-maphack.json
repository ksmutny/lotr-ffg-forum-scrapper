I left the game for about 6 months. Recently pulled my collection back out. I am behind 2 sagas and about 10 adventure packs. I need to drop about $200 right now to catch back up. I don't have the money to spend all at once so I will try to slowly build it back up. It is a discouragement though to feel so far behind. Love this game though...my favorite of all time. Will still be playing it long after the sets stop coming out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181968-the-lord-of-the-rings-maphack/?do=findComment&comment=1693079","commentId":1693079,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1436969744,"content":"Cool map by the way.

I also don't know much about game retail, but I've also heard it mentioned that it can be problematic for store owners to either have to stock a ton of expansions for these games or choose what to stock, how to explain it to customers, etc. Anyway, the idea of FFG releasing ready-made decks or at least a pack containing the best cards for a particular trait/deck type (i.e. a \"Dwarf\" pack, a \"Noldor\" pack, etc.) has been mentioned before and could help with this problem, but I don't know if they would release something that could potentially be viewed as competing with their own products."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181968-the-lord-of-the-rings-maphack/?do=findComment&comment=1694876","commentId":1694876,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1437112871,"content":"extremely cool."}]}
