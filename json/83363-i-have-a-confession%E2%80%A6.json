There is only so much FFG can add to the game within the LotR license using existing stuff without dabbling into Silmarillion - which would probably need to be separated from the current game (because frankly, Elrond going to a quest with Denethor is already weird - but Denethor questing with Húrin, that would be just stupid).\n\n \n\nAnd Heirs of Númenor was underwhelming so far, when speaking of player cards.
