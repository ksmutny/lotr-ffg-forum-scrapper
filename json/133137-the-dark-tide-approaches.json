This has massively paid off as the Legolas ally is not only amazing as well as very powerful and obviously thematic in my elven decks but also has the Silvan trait so can have his cost reduced by O Lorien and has 4 attack instead of 3 the turn he is played so long as you run Celeborn. If you run Galadriel (which I don't) AND Celeborn he can quest for 2 and then attack for 4 and draw you a card the first turn he is in play. Lastly whilst you would almost always ideally return a Naith Guide or Galadhon Archer to hand to use Feigned Voices or Pursuing the Enemy Legolas can provide a good back up option if you desperately need to use either event.\n\n \n\nNow that I think about it he's actually a pretty good target for sneak attack as well as you can sneak attack him during player attacks, he still goes up to 4 attack from Celeborn, destroys an enemy, draws you a card and returns to hand ready to be played at 4 attack strength again. Not bad at all considering how few targets there are for sneak attack that actually work well.\n\nEdited January 27, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1423195","commentId":1423195,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1422334270,"content":"Also just want to say I REALLY love the art on Legolas, same artist as the Haldir hero which I think also has incredible art.\n\nGoing to be running proxies of Legolas ally tonight and will report my experience"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133137-the-dark-tide-approaches/?do=findComment&comment=1423251","commentId":1423251,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1422340397,"content":"So now that we know that Legolas and Gimli aren't the heroes, I've been trying to figure out who the new heroes could possibly be.\n\nIt could well be Merry and Pippin, but I'm still hoping to get copies of those two with the Rohan and Gondor traits, which makes more sense to go in one of the Return of the King boxes. Plus, I'm not sure I need 3 different Pippin heroes before we get some other important heroes (ahem Arwen) first. I'm hoping they show up as allies here.\n\nTreebeard and Erkenbrand seem like logical choices, given their pivotal roles in the battles of Isengard and Helm's Deep, respectively. But the antlered crown just gave us both of these cards, so that makes me feel like they were making up for a decision to cut them from this box. We don't really need second copies of these characters yet; we've barely had a chance to play with the copies we just got.\n\nSo who else shows up in the first half of the Two Towers? Quickbeam? But it would seem strange to get a Quickbeam hero before Treebeard. We don't have Gamling or Grimbold yet, and they're both present at the battle of Helm's Deep, so it could be them. Maybe we'll get a \"Battle of the Fords of Isen\" quest, then they'd be obvious choices. Hama dies during the battle for Helm's Deep, maybe it's his turn for a new hero. I think Elfhelm was present too.\n\nBut honestly, it feels strange to think of FFG shipping a deluxe set featuring bit characters as the heroes. In that case, Theoden and Eomer are really the best choices once Gimli and Legolas (and Aragorn) are out. I'm still having fun with the Theoden and Eomer that we have, but I suppose I wouldn't mind a fresh coat of paint on them.\n\nThoughts?

Other than King Under the Mountain (with a Dwarf hero), card draw is the biggest weakness for this strategy.

With those stats, what else would you be doing with him? Off the top of my head, I can't think of another ranged ally with 3 printed attack - Legolas is a beast. If you consider just how effective he will be when Celeborn is on the table, it gets silly.

He costs 4, which with Leadership is always affordable if you use Steward or a Thorin dwarf deck, can quest and attack in the same round for 2 (or 3 if using Dain, which is the best case scenario for this ally).
