We also got an Alt Art version of Lore (Core) Glorfindel as a part of the Gen Con 2018 kit alongside The Wizard's Quest. It is unlikely to come across that one, as Gen Con alt arts are much rarer than Fellowship ones (also counts for Gimli, Boromir, and Celeborn).\n\nIn terms of getting a hold of these Alt Art cards, the official ones are rare but can occasionally be found on Ebay for ridiculous prices. Sometimes, the community finds an extra kit and tries to sell the pieces via the Facebook group or the forums, so keep an eye on that. I myself got my hands on 2 Fellowship 2015 kits with Legolas and sold them to the community as well. Attending events like Gen Con and your local Fellowship event is still the most reliable (and cheapest) way to get a hold of these cards. Otherwise, Strange Eons will let you make your own Alt Art cards, but they won't be official."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/258858-official-alt-art-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3578268","commentId":3578268,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1546172034,"content":"For the complete list as of 2018:\n\nGenCon and Fellowship 2014: Aragorn (Le) http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Aragorn-FotBD [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Aragorn-FotBD]\n\nGenCon 2015: Gimil (T) http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Gimli-TRoB [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Gimli-TRoB]\nFellowship 2015: Legolas (T) http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Legolas-MatPP [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Legolas-MatPP]\n\nGenCon 2016: Boromir (T) http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Boromir-TSoA [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Boromir-TSoA]\nFellowship 2016: Faramir (Le) http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Faramir-TSoA [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Faramir-TSoA]\n\nGenCon 2017: Celeborn http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Celeborn-AoDG [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Celeborn-AoDG]\nFellowship 2017: Galadriel http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Galadriel-AoDG [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Galadriel-AoDG]\n\nGenCon 2018: Glorfindel (Lo) http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Glorfindel-TWQ [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Glorfindel-TWQ]\nFellowship 2018: Éowyn (S) http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Eowyn-TWR [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Eowyn-TWR]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/258858-official-alt-art-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3578615","commentId":3578615,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1546220893,"content":"> 13 hours ago, Durins_Father said:\n> \n> I myself got my hands on 2 Fellowship 2015 kits with Legolas and sold them to the community as well.

You'll have to use the shop as a middle man, but that is still a good method of obtaining the kits. You can also try to find other players in Italy who would like to attend the event, giving them a part of the kit as well. That's how I got my hands on the 2017 kit last year.
