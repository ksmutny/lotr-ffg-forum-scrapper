Gloin died off early as a sacrificial lamb due to low ally draw and high spider spam from the encounter deck. However, an early Steward of Gondor on Theodred was huge as I had enough resources not to miss Gloin for too long and get more allies out. Aragorn's power is amazing as he continued to advance quests and kill spiders in his spare time. The nail in the coffin for the Enemy was when I got Faramir out and was able to use his power, play the event card (can't remember the name now) that lets you stand an ally, and quest for a huge 8 willpower on the Chosen Path that makes you avoid Ungoliant's Spawn in favor of getting ten progress tokens.\n\nOverall it was a really fun experience and I can't wait to keep going down the quest line to see how far I can take these three. Gloin's not my favorite without some ability to heal him, and Theodred was really just a good Steward (appropriately!) to Aragorn who was the real star. \n\nHow'd it go for everyone else?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=456160","commentId":456160,"userName":"thefoehammer","timestamp":1303254815,"content":"I tried the tactics deck with Gimli, Legolas and Thalin.

Got off to a bit of a slow start. The deck's healing powers are awesome, but it suffers from a real lack of combat strength aside from Glorfindel, who also happens to be the best quester. I was lucky to get Hemarth Riversong in my opening hand, who's ability let me look at the top card of the encounter deck every turn - so I wasn't ever surprised. I also got a couple of Daughters of Nimrodel out early and their healing mojo kept my characters feeling good. I had the misfortune to draw Ungoliant's Spawn early and had to lock him down with the expensive-but-amazingly-effective \"Forest Snare\".\n\nBut it wasn't all fun and games, an early \"Caught in a Web\" locked down Denethor for the majority of the game, until I finally pulled a Miner of the Iron Hills to free him. The game came down to the wire, my threat was in the mid-high 40's and I had already locked down the Spawn when I got to the end of the quest, so I had to pull 2 more Spiders on top of an Orc that was already giving me trouble. So not only did I have to take down the really, really tough Spawn, but I had to hold off 3 other baddies to boot. Long story short a lot of guys got sacrificed while my Heroes fought off the Spawn. The last round was nail biting...my three Daughters of Nimrodel all defended the 3 opponents while my three heroes and my Erebor Hammersmith attacked the Spawn. One daughter sucked it up and died. The second...ran into a horrendous Shadow card that dealt 1 damage to all of my characters, instantly killing her AND the other defender. So that left 2 attacks undefended, which took down 2 of my heroes in one fell blow. I was left with Glorfindel and the Hammersmith, who did exactly enough damage together to take out Ungoliant's Spawn.\n\nClose! Really close! But they did the job. I had a bit of luck (getting the early Daughters was key) and a bit of bad luck (Caught in a Web is just brutal and effectively takes one of your heroes out of the game, and I had Gandalf up and ready to fight Ungoliants spawn but discarded him out of my huge hand when I traveled Necromancers Pass the turn before) so I think overall it was fairly even.\n\nSkimming through the rest of the decks has me interested to try them out. The Tactics deck looks great, but it also looks like it would be almost impossible to play solo. The Spirit deck looks fairly boring and has some pretty weak heroes aside from Eowyn. And, finally, the Leadership deck looks absolutely head and shoulders stronger than the others, especially with the broken Celebrian's Stone and Steward of Gondor support cards. Celebrian's Stone alone, while unique, almost makes one want to buy three sets to run 3x just so you can drop it on Aragorn asap.\n\nAnyways, those are my thoughts!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=456491","commentId":456491,"userName":"Rashley","timestamp":1303301135,"content":"I practiced with 2 normal teams of Heroes, like a 2 player game, but on my own.  It does seem easier.  Each of the Spheres are good in 1 or 2 areas, but have weaknessess in others that the 'GAME' can exploit.  Getting another Sphere to cover your deficiencies, looks the way to go.  Solo Sphere play can be won, has been won and will be won, but it is tough.  Well done to all who have succeeded!  Remember that the  Milkwood Quest is only difficulty 1.  The next is 4, and the third is 7!  Hopefully we will all know the game better by then.  Cheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=456502","commentId":456502,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1303302719,"content":"Got it today and so far have gone through 2 of the single sphere decks against the first quest.\n\nI agree with others that tactics is a difficult deck to win solo with, it took me three attempts, and the third attempt i think i was pretty lucky to avoid too many locations, as these can just clog up the staging area and with the low willpower ratings of the tactics deck (and difficult to obtain any bonuses) its very difficult to progress the quest.\n\nIf you can get past card 1B though, \"2B and 3B can fall pretty quickly.\n\nHave also played with Leadership deck, and using Theodred's power with Aragorn's to effectively allow Aragorn to quest and fight in the same round is a pretty powerful combo.

I scored 40 points.\n\nThe second game (Lore) was slightly more difficult but was turned around eventually by adding Faramir to the party. I scored 37 points.\n\nThe third game (Spirit) started extremely well since I could keep my threat level very low. In the end I lost because I had drawn the alternate third adventure card where you have to defeat the Spider boss. Since it kills a character every turn, I was soon running out of combatants.\n\nTo be honest I felt that the first scenario is a bit wonky, at least if played solo with mono-sphere decks. The outcome pretty much depends on which version of adventure card 3 you're drawing. If it's 'Beorn's Path' (which I had drawn in my first two games) and you have a sphere that is good at adventuring, you'll win. I assume if you're using the Tactics deck, you'll win if you draw the other path.\n\nAfter the very first round of dumb mistakes, I immediately picked up my 'winning strategy' for future games: Don't go adventuring in the first round so you have the best chance to immediately get rid of the Forest Spider. Once you reach the third adventure card, go adventuring with as many characters as you can, ideally winning it in a single round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=456913","commentId":456913,"userName":"apelite","timestamp":1303365046,"content":" I just played a Aragorn/Theodred/Eowyn Ld/Sp deck and sailed through Mirkwood with a score of 35.

Using specific Encounter sets really enhances the story feel and makes each quest really different and new cards and sets will enhance the story and challenges and make it more replayable.\n\nWhile we are looking forward to seeing new characters, my fear is that adding lots of new attachments and events, especially if they require modifications to the existing rules, will interfere with the wonderful flow and ease of play. That's what, IMHO, killed the Decipher CCG. Later expansions overwhelmed the rules with all sorts of oddities that made it harder to play and less fun.\n\nKeep the Quests and Encounters coming! That's the heart of the game and story. More characters (can't wait to see Bilbo in the next pack) would be great too. But please take it easy on Events and Attachments so it doesn't become an arms race or spin off in odd directions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=458240","commentId":458240,"userName":"SerAndrew","timestamp":1303599813,"content":" I played with the standard Aragorn, Gloin, Theodred in a solo game.\n\nFirst, I absolutely crushed the Mirkwood quest.

If not, my enthusiasm for this game dropped quite a bit.\n\n\n\nYeah, if you have 3-4 enemies engaged then you are going to have a problem but you should kill them before it comes to that point. Plus in the first scenario you shouldn't have that much trouble with the first turn. \n\nSay you are playing the lore deck. You get an average starting hand and play something like the Daughter of the Nimrodel. There is 3 Threat Strength showing (in the form of a Forest Spider and an Old Forest Road) so you decide to send Glorfindel and your Daughter of the Nimrondel questing. Say you flip a second Forest Spider. You increase your threat by 1 but that was a risk you took. You decide to travel to the Old Forest Road so you can straighten Glorfindel and use him to attack. Then the two forest spiders engage you. You decide to defend against one of them with Denethor and he takes no damage. Since you know you can use your Daughter of Nimrodel to heal you later you decide not to defend against the other attack. You put the three damage on Glorfindel. Then you use Beravor and Glorfindel to attack and kill one of the Forest Spiders (Their combined attack total of 5 is enough to kill it). Then you increase your threat by one because it is at the end of the turn.\n\nSo at the end of the first turn you have 3 damage on Glorfindal which you can heal most of next turn and a single Forest Spider in front of you. There is nothing in the staging so you can send only Beravor questing so that you can attack the Forest Spider with Glorfindel. Maybe you even have an extra ally or two to make the turn easier. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=460464","commentId":460464,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1303987988,"content":"Thank you.\n\nI've since played a couple of other types of deck and won.

I knew I shouldn't have let that Dol Guldur Orc attack go through unblocked...\n\nI've played a few other games: a 3 player Spirit/Lore/Tactics game, and Spirit/Tactics game, and we've managed to win all of those on the Escape through Mirkwood scenario.\n\nOverall, Spirit is my favorite faction right now, though I see huge potential in a Leadership/Tactics deck (Sneak Attack-> Beorn, etc.). Now I have 2 more core sets on the way so me and the missus can start fiending.

Got swamped by Spiders and when Chieftan Ufthak entered the fray, the game was up.All heroes killed in the turn I started Quest 3. With Threat at 47, I had no hope at all of killing US in 3 turns while at the same time questing to prevent threat being added and keeping my heroes alive.\n\nSecond game against PtM-BP was on a knife edge. I eventually lost due to Threat hitting 50 with 9 progress tokens placed on Quest 3! The killer was a last-turn Necromancer's Reach which took out Glorfindel and removed his 3 Willpower from the Quest. If I hadn't spent my 2 available pool (Denethor had already fallen to the Hummerhorns) on an Erebor Hammersmith for his 1 WP, but 1 of them on healing Glorfindel, he would have lived and I would have scored the winning progress token.

Using Aragorn twice per turn is very, very helpful. The second game was a success too, even though I had to kill Ungoliant's Spawn twice. Overall, the Leadership deck is effective, flexible and very forgiving of new player mistakes. After playing half a dozen more games, I think this deck may actually be a little too strong.\n\nThat made my first games with the other starter decks kind of disappointing. When the encounter draws went well (when they alternate weak foes with bonus-granting locations) the Spirit, Lore and Tactics starter decks are fun and challenging. But they fall apart quickly when the encounters don't go their way.\n\nNow I'm trying my first few games with mixed, 50-card decks. It probably has a lot to do with my inexperience, but these decks are really susceptible to bad encounter draws. On my best game (with a mixed Leadership and Lore deck designed to generate resource points and cards as fast as possible), I fought the encounter deck to a standstill. All those cards and resources gave me a lot of options, but deciding how to use those options was very slow. After 90 minutes I called it a night. On my worst game, I lost two of my heroes on my second turn to a horrible combination of the Necromancer's Reach and the Hummerhorn's shadow effect. Since then I've played 7 or 8 more games, and they've all been pretty quick and pretty brutal. I'm hoping I'll get better with time, but right now the frustration's getting the better of me and my decision-making's getting worse with every game.\n\nHaven't had my first 2-player game yet. But that'll happen next week. I suspect that this is where the game really shines anyway.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=464839","commentId":464839,"userName":"jormungandr","timestamp":1304740472,"content":":D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Seems i've done something wrong. perhaps that's why my first couple of goes at PtM were so easy. I have played passage through mirkwood for about 5 times now and i've never lost, usually finishing a solo game with around 45 points and a dual game with 60/65. I think the mistake i'm making is this. Instead of mono faction (tactics, lore, etc.) i'm playing dual sphere decks. Both in solo and dual games. For a game I just mesh up all the spirit and leadership cards + 3 gandalf for a 61 cards deck and take 2 heroes, say Aragorn and Eowyn.\n\nIsn't this a valid way to play the game? The games have been rather easy until now, beacuse most of the time i played with one 'combat' sphere (tactics, leaderschip) and one 'control' sphere (lore, spirit.)
