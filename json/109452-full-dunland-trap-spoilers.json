Is this a trend we need to be worried about?\n> \n> Simple and hard versus complex and easier?\n\nThe quest is pretty cool. There are plenty of forced effect to keep track of, but I don't find it any more complex as some others. The more complex quests like this usually see less repeated plays because when I want to have a quick causal game that I like to test new decks on i'll choose something else. There is definitely a formula that has to be figured out to win. Alot of the formula comes down to the transition between stages in this one. Once you know what these transitions are you build a deck accordingly. The transitions between quest cards in this scenario are quite dramatic, and are going to effect your early choices, and the 1st stage messes with a turtle strategy, since you are having to discard your hand every couple turns, but if you speed things up and blast into the 2nd stage you might be unprepared for what you face, and stage 2 intentionally messes up any early preparations any way. All this creates a tense balance of how to proceed.\n\nI decided after losing with eomer/eowyn/imrahil twice to go with my other deck that came out of VoI Grima/ Aragorn/Mirlonde Kamikaze draw deck, and to my surprise it's won 2 out of 3. It's quite funny to play, since my opening strategy is to select the Boar enemy that gets a shadow card when cards are drawn, so before the first quest phase I'll draw like crazy until i get song of kings, Gandalf, and sneak attack, drop a ranger spikes into the staging area while I'm at it and then sneak Gandalf in for quest phase and deal 4 damage to the guy and remove a heap of shadow cards. It's actually not to hard to do with this deck. This deck can get to the 2nd stage pretty easily and does not suffer from the transition all that bad, it actually benefits a bit since my discard pile gets reshuffled into my deck. Dealing with the bear clan chief relies on some chump blockers, and Gandalf a bunch of times. Playing Gandalf for full cost in the last round when the last time counter is removed is a good strategy, since he can defend the chief in combat, then Gandalf will ready in refresh, time counter will be removed, chief attacks again, and Gandalf defends again for the win. I guess the chief never hast to be attacked and defeated to win, not to hard to do, but would add a bit more to the win condition other then just having to defend with all your heroes remaining."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109452-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1140643","commentId":1140643,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1404280393,"content":"Hey tracker! haven't seen you around for a while.. been cooking some new decks or waiting for the full cycle?\n\n\n\n> Let this be a lesson to some.

The heroes for the deck are Eowyn, Eomer, and Beregond. Eomer, in my opinion has become the best attacker in the game. With one Rohan Warhorse and Firefoot he can do some serious damage. Firefoot puts him at 5 attack, which is great, because then he does not need to rely on allies leaving play regularly, when I need to bump him up to 7 I'll use spirit bofur. Pairing him up with the best defender and quester in the game makes for an interesting deck that can handle most things without relying on a ton of allies.\n\nI was almost going to hold off building decks until I had the whole cycle in hand, since I find it kind of pointless to build a silvan deck with Celeborn right now when we are only scratching the surface of silvan synergy. Secrecy, is also intriguing, but i don't necessarly see how it would help on a quest like Dunland Trap. It's probably the worst quest to try it out on since an enemy is engaged in set up, and turtle strategy seems to suffer. I would love to get all player cards right away, but Then it would be very clear which cards were headed to the box, at least I might try some of the cards that seem a bit lack luster and may even find a use for a card that I thought was worthless, so I guess I'm okay with it. Also scenarios that are earlier in the cycle become easier with all the player cards for the cycle, so I did not want to miss out on that challenge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109452-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1140786","commentId":1140786,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1404296214,"content":"yeah, I pre-order the entire cycle and get them delivered in a go for the same reason.

I dont even have any card draw in my deck since the scenario is so generous. It makes a lot more sense to go with a non item attachment deck then trying to build up an ally army. Once all this is figured out it's pretty simple. Funny thing is that i took some of these deck that work for this scenario against some easier scenarios and they really struggle.

Besides Frodo/Beorn absorbing damage is there any way people have found to combat this?\n\nI like the different win condition, all heroes having to survive the last stage is something we have not seen yet, and it make the story seem more realistic. There are plenty of other scenarios I have won with only 1 or 2 heroes left, sure I won but if I were continuing on a real adventure those heroes had been lost. When you play and you don't care if your heroes make it or not, it's more about winning and a bit less about the theme of the game, or something like that.\n\nAnyway, for soloOne-hand I've played a few decks on this scenario, but there are 2 decks that I'm having fun with. that are nearly identical except for a hero change and a few different cards. I have eomer, eowyn , and either Beregond or Eleanor. In either case Eleanor and Beregond become super defenders. I'll put as many copies of UC on them as I can draw, Miruvor comes in handy to, and so does Behind Strong Walls. I also have a few copies of Gondorian discipline and Close Call, in case damage sneaks through. The key card is Blood of Gondor and letting resources pile up on the hero, because when the Gondorian shield is lost in stage 2 you want to make sure you have at least 2 UC, BoG, and at least 5+ resources to spare, especially if your playing with Eleanor. I plan on facing at least 2 -3 attacks in the final stage each round, until time is up, when time is up at end of the resource phase UC and hero refreshes before the final attacks so the hero can defend again.\n\nIn 2 player mode I think I would try to turn Beregond into a super defender and load both decks with readying effects that allow him to defend the entire board if possible as sentinel. In 2 player I would probably include cards that negate attacks, and can imagine thicket of spears being quite useful if your lucky to have it in had at the end of the game.\n\nI find the treachery condition cards that deal damage to be the toughest to deal with, they can turn a smooth ride into a loss quickly. Since I have been playing Spirit Tactics I've found the Power of Orthanc to be key on this quest, early on in my first few decks I was even Including The Seeing Stone to fetch it if I was in trouble. I also discovered a good use for The seeing Stone and Close Call on shadow cards that chain into a number of +x attack. It's pretty nifty to take advantage of the action window before damage is calculated and use The Seeing Stone to fetch Close Call and then turn the excess damage into threat, it saved a hero a few times. Cool trick, but I have abandoned the strategy in the deck since it took up to much deck space.\n\nAnyway it is cool scenario, but the decks I designed for this are pretty pitiful on some of the older scenarios I like to play, since I have put les emphasis on allies in the deck, I'm even playing cards like Favor of the Lady to give Eowyn just a bit more willpower. The scenario does not take a ton of willpower to be successful. Defending multiple attacks and dealing with damage is the challenge.\n\nOne last note, as I said before, Eomer, Firefoot and Rohan Warhorse is a force to be reckoned, and with if an ally leaves play he'll clear 2 - 3 beefy Dunlandings a round. Pretty cool really to bad this only lasts for stage 1."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109452-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1142235","commentId":1142235,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1404403248,"content":">  \n> \n> > Hall of Beorn Card Search now includes The Dunland Trap, as well:\n> > \n> > http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?CardSet=The+Dunland+Trap [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?CardSet=The+Dunland+Trap]\n> \n>  \n> \n> http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?CardType=Event&CardSet=The%20Dunland%20Trap&Trait=Any&Keyword=Any&Cost=-1&Sphere=None&Unique=False&Sort=None&Artist=Any&Random=False&Filter1CardType=None&Filter2CardType=None [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?CardType=Event&CardSet=The%20Dunland%20Trap&Trait=Any&Keyword=Any&Cost=-1&Sphere=None&Unique=False&Sort=None&Artist=Any&Random=False&Filter1CardType=None&Filter2CardType=None]\n> \n>  \n> \n> Old South Road is showing up as an Event instead of a Location.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nThanks for the heads up on this.

I do actually like the win and lose condition (from a thematic point especially).  What I meant with random was the idea that without as many allies and with being stripped of many items, it can make it hard depending on certain conditions which attach to locations or treacheries that require each player to look for a dunland enemy, etc. - and then on top of that putting the Chief into play (followed by 'enemy makes additional' attacks).

It's a very well laid Trap, and this is exactly what the designers intended, and I think they did a fantastic job of capturing the feel of being on the edge of defeat. Love it! and it fit in perfectly with the story line, they nailed it. In my opinion they perfectly matched, theme, storyline, and game play mechanics in this one.\n\nIn a few of my post earlier, I was saying it's not a great deck tester. We'll that's coming from the perspective of trying to create one deck to rule them all. Interesting thing is that some of my rule them all decks do not do so well on this quest, and the decks I tailor to this quest do not do so well on other scenarios. I like this, and I hope more scenarios will have this type of unique feel to them, as much as it can be a pain building or altering decks for specific scenarios, I do enjoy how it lets me search for solutions in the pool of cards I seldom use. I'd rather use most if not all of all the player cards I have, rather than paying hundreds of dollars and only using a 50 cards that can beat all scenarios.\n\nI hope future scenarios continue down this road.

Lost my first attempt and won on the second try. Got pretty lucky on the second go though and didn't have nearly as bad encounter draws. I breezed through the first stage on my first attempt however but spent quite a while on stage 1 the second attempt. On the second try the only two enemies I had to defend against when the last time counter was removed on stage 3 was Chief Turch and a Boar Clan Warrior. Easily defended both and had about triple the attack power needed to kill them both, captured my ass!!!!!! I guess the theme and feel of the last stage is that you are utterly surrounded though and the enemies in play/engaged are simply those rushing in to actually attack you so even if the board is clear you are still surrounded by their horde.\n\nIt works well building up your strength (has to be non-item attachments however and minimal allies as most will be discarded) on stage 1 before progressing through to stage 2 and the trap so that you are ready as stage 2 becomes stage 3 right after combat and then the struggle for survival truly begins. As much as stage 1 really pushes you to rush I find taking it slow is far better as the worst part about the discard your hand effect is how many draw triggers it sets off when it makes you redraw 2 new cards right before the resource phase in which you draw again (obviously these draw triggers are only worse than the discarding itself if there are encounter cards in play that trigger effects off card draw).\n\nI found the following encounter cards especially nasty and the worst cards to see revealed during staging: \n\n-Hills of Dunland: if you can't get this out of the staging area you're in for a world of hurt as it constantly brings enemies out and may even do so just when you travel there, also sets off all other draw effects making boar clan enemies nastier.\n\n-In Need of Rest: this pretty much killed any chance I had my first attempt, diabolical on the last stage and can pretty much kill a hero on full health in a round if enough enemies engage players and enough time counters are removed..\n\n-Hithlaeglir Foothills: The threat of this location skyrockets if you have draw effects occuring, even if not it gains 2 threat a turn just from drawing during the resource phase, very nasty... also has surge.... (because it can potentially have 0 threat the whole first turn it is revealed so long as no one draws cards for any reason)\n\n-Wild Men of Dunland: Just like in need of rest this can be scarily powerful especially if there are multiple draw triggers in play, this and Hills of Dunland combine to make life truly miserable every time you draw a card.\n\n-Dunland Berseker: while not especially powerful I've noticed this enemy makes a lot more additional attacks due to card draw in this quest than in The Fords of Isen where there is alot less card draw hate but more hand size hate instead.\n\n \n\nI found the following encounter cards however, either strangely beneficial or not very powerful at all:\n\n-Off track: this card is awful if it comes out during stage 1, effectively making you discard your hand every turn rather than every second turn if you cant clear the location but if it comes out during stage 3 it helps you speed through the time counters much faster bringing you closer to the final defense and victory. One worrying thing however is how well this card combos with In Need of Rest, dealing damage to the attached hero even faster.\n\n-Dunlending Ambush: As nasty as this card can be (and it has surge!) of the 4 or 5 times I've had it come out during staging it has been discarded and did nothing 4 of those 5 times as it is attached to the ACTIVE location and if you do not have an active location it does not do anything at all and simply surges. The one time it did attach to a location I thankfully did not have many enemies already engaged so its effect was not too brutal.\n\n-Hithlaeglir Stream: This location makes you draw 2 cards instead of 1 during the resource phase. No cards in this quest punish you for drawing more than 1 card at a time, only for drawing cards in general so this effect doesn't combo with ANY other encounter card and if you're going to be punished for drawing cards ANYWAY why not draw 2 instead of 1 which is only beneficial for the player. Weird encounter card but I've always really enjoyed the occasional slightly beneficial encounter card in harder quests which provide unexpected or surprise help when you're struggling.\n\n-Plains of Enedwaith: This location stops you from drawing a card during the resource phase when it is the active location. So long as you already have a decent amount of cards in your hands I've found this card purely beneficial as it essentially stops all those card draw triggers that go off at the start of each turn during the resource phase. This location can stop Hills of Dunland triggering at the start of each turn, stops Dunland Berserker making an early additional attack, stops Boar Clan Warrior from getting a shadow card and stops Boar Clan stalker growing in size. It also stops the trigger from Wild Men of Dunland and Foothills of Hithlaeglir as well. It also only has 2 threat and 2 quest points so can be instantly cleared by Asfaloth and provides very little threat. Pretty much the least harmful and best possible card to be revealed during staging.\n\n \n\nI honestly found that the encounter cards and the way they all combo together is so much worse than the forced effects of the various quest stages. So long as you plan for the trap you can just lose an item or two. Similarly with stage 1 so long as you use the most important/helpful cards in your hand over the first two turns you shouldn't lose too much and actually get to draw new cards (even if it's only 2 (plus the one from the resource phase so really you end up with 3, this also however triggers card draw encounter effects twice like I said above...) which could potentially be better than those you had to discard.\n\nReally impressed by the quest and from my experience so far think it is very fun and thematic as well. The only issue is how complex and finicky it can become if four or five draw triggers are in play. Time counters on the last stage can be slightly tricky as well if Off Track is in play and many enemies are engaging each turn, I found on my first attempt I made a couple of small mistakes (mainly Off track being attached to a location and me forgetting to remove an additional time counter from its effect once or twice) so made sure on the second attempt that any time any player drew any amount of cards OR any time a time counter was going to be removed I checked every engaged enemy, every card in staging, the current location and any condition attachments on players. I don't believe I made any mistakes (or at least hope not!) the second time but it took ALOT longer, probably around an hour long game (two handed) as I was constantly checking and double checking everything. I think the quest is really awesome and well designed but can have far too many moving parts during certain play throughs of it. I certainly hope that all future quests will not involve this level of complexity and this many triggers/moving parts every turn of game play. Don't get me wrong I do want quests with new mechanics and a certain level of complexity but I hope that is not just done in similar ways to this quest too often. I also really hope that time counters will appear on a handful of quests in the future but not all of or most of them, as great as they are I really don't want to see them used in every quest.\n\nEdited July 11, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109452-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1150788","commentId":1150788,"userName":"Spurries","timestamp":1405048162,"content":"You mention you had enought attack power to Kill the chief,\n\nYou know he can't be killed right?
