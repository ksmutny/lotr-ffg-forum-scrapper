Shuffle that card back into the encounter deck and reveal another encounter card.\n\n \n\nWhat exactly can be cancelled using Frodo's action?  Is it only \"When Revealed\" effects?  Could you cancel the \"Forced\" action of a creature being revealed? Surge? Peril?  I think the spirit of the card is meant to cancel \"When Revealed\" effects but it isn't' explicitly clear.  Thanks in advance.  \n\n \n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238619-the-black-riders-frodo-and-cancellations/?do=findComment&comment=2569566","commentId":2569566,"userName":"rsdockery","timestamp":1483477847,"content":"It cancels everything. The cancelled card has no effect whatsoever, as if it were just a blank piece of card stock. Cards that are limited to \"When Revealed\" cancellation explicitly say so (eg, A Test of Will)."}]}
