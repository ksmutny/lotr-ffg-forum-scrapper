Shes not much of a deck builder and I hate having to rebuild decks for specific quests (especially because progression and saga are kind of weird). I have the limited core though, would those decks have an ok chance of doing the saga?\n\nÂ \n\nCheers"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290076-limited-core-pre-built-decks-in-saga/?do=findComment&comment=3608400","commentId":3608400,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1548876492,"content":"By \"limited core\", do you mean the 30-card monosphere decks that come with a core set, or the pre-built decks that come with the Limited Starter Edition?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290076-limited-core-pre-built-decks-in-saga/?do=findComment&comment=3608423","commentId":3608423,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1548877331,"content":"If you mean the Limited Edition Starter, I would give a strong no. They are well suited for the quests in that box, and some of the easier quests farther along, but it would take a very experienced player to take them through the saga. They also really wouldn't provide the best experience for that group of quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290076-limited-core-pre-built-decks-in-saga/?do=findComment&comment=3608437","commentId":3608437,"userName":"taylorcowbell","timestamp":1548877965,"content":"Yeah sorry, I meant the limited edition starter.
