If you are interested in the video or want to help me out with some feedback, feel free to watch the short (< 15 minutes) video of me playing a Rohan Rush deck vs. Passage Through Mirkwood and let me know what you think.\n\n(I already spotted one mistake: Imrahil should have taken 1 extra damage on turn 1 as I forgot to fully resolve the attack. Guess that happens when you try to make the video short)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThx for watching"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68610-tried-my-hand-at-recording-a-game-of-mine-feedback-welcome/?do=findComment&comment=669032","commentId":669032,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1344199381,"content":" Looks good to me!

The sound was good and your commentary was perfectly done, describing what was going on all the time. I particularly enjoyed the speed at which you played, there was no messing about.

They can only prosecute the person and servers that share it. Anyway FFG, made a great game. I only play the cards that I also own in print on OCTGN. Is that what FFG said? That people can reproduce their cards 6 months after release? If that is true this company earned enormous respect with me.

The price of the sets is about right. And they should be protected. With many people actually preferring playing it on the computer rather than storing all the boxes and cards and messing with tokens I think this may be dangerous for the game. Many people will prefer to play it for free rather than paying and messing with boxes and cards, tokens and card sleeves. And as you said, this can kill the game. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68610-tried-my-hand-at-recording-a-game-of-mine-feedback-welcome/?do=findComment&comment=674801","commentId":674801,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1345122581,"content":" Well, FFG is in no danger of losing my business to these computer emulations of board games.
