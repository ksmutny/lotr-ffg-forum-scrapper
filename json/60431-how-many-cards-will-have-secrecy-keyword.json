Might be a few more than that in order to introduce the mechanic in the first AP of the cycle (one per sphere, maybe?).\n\nAs to its utility, I think the secrecy cards we've seen are pretty good even if you don't get the discount. Timely Aid gives you a limited deck search and allows you to play ANY ally you find. It's well worth 4 Leadership resources, and it's an absolute steal if you can play it for 1. Needful to Know is a bit more iffy, but it's still threat reduction in a non-Spirit sphere. I'll be interested to see how one- and two-hero decks work out, and I think secrecy could really be a nice addition to the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60431-how-many-cards-will-have-secrecy-keyword/?do=findComment&comment=593948","commentId":593948,"userName":"guest455987","timestamp":1329164684,"content":"I agree.  The cards we've seen so far seem like they're useful even at their regular cost.  But I think the main purpose is to create the viability for 1-2 Hero decks.  These will be great for those, and help to offset the difficulty of that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60431-how-many-cards-will-have-secrecy-keyword/?do=findComment&comment=594075","commentId":594075,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1329199027,"content":"We'll see how it turns out. One interesting aspect of the article is that they imply there was a lot (some?) of playtesting involved with Secrecy cards. This sounds like a good sign to me. I hope they tested the strategy solo as well as multiplayer (I assume they focused mostly on 2 players games).\n\nAs for the viability of 1-2 heroes decks, it'll still depend on the number of \"free\" secrecy cards we see and how much card advantage those generates.\n\nThe first 2-3 turns are always the most crucials in any game (especialy solo). Losing a hero from the start makes a huge difference (we all felt it in Escape from Dol Guldur) because you're not only losing 3 resources over these first 3 turns, but you're also losing a quester / attacker / defender each turn. The secrecy cards will need to be very powerful to offset that cost. We'll probably want to look at 2-for-1 card advantage at least, or more permanent long-term gain.\n\nThe new card previewed yesterday doesn't fit that category as far as I'm concerned. It's a threat reduction card in non-spirit, which is nice. In and by itself, it's a card to consider. Lore keeps on stepping on Spirit's toes (I won't complain, I'm a Lore fan): it can play around the treacheries with Denethor, deal with locations directly with Ancestral Memories, prevent Shadow effects with A Burning Brand. And the dwarven basis in Lore is just as strong as the Rohan one in Spirit.\n\nBut is that card enough to justify losing a hero at the start of the game? I don't think so..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60431-how-many-cards-will-have-secrecy-keyword/?do=findComment&comment=594137","commentId":594137,"userName":"Pericles","timestamp":1329214304,"content":"I would answer the question posed in the title of this thread, but I've been sworn to........ secrecy.\n\ngui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60431-how-many-cards-will-have-secrecy-keyword/?do=findComment&comment=594159","commentId":594159,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1329217690,"content":"Pericles said:\n\nI would answer the question posed in the title of this thread, but I've been sworn to........ secrecy.\n\ngui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\n\n\nhaahaa very witty gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60431-how-many-cards-will-have-secrecy-keyword/?do=findComment&comment=594847","commentId":594847,"userName":"RGun","timestamp":1329352742,"content":"I agree with SiCK_Boy, playing with 1 less hero is a significant disadvantage - especially solo when it takes away 1/3 of your actions (versus only 1/6 in a 2 player game).  I wonder if there will start to be some player cards with actions that raise your threat when you activate them - this would make for some interesting deck building and play decisions (e.g. do I execute this action and raise my threat over 20, or not?).  Only way I see 2 heroes working solo is if there was an event card that let you send a hero away and deduct his threat (thematically, this would be like sending a hero off to lure the enemies away from the main group).  Then you could start with 3 heroes to get through the first few critical rounds when you're building up some allies, and then go down to 2 heroes later on to reduce your threat and take advantage of secrecy cards."}]}
