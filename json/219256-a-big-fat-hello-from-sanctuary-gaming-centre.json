Our Organised play events are growing in numbers with cheap entry fees and a spacious gaming area.\n\n \n\nWe are proud to be hosting a Star Wars LCG regional and we aim to host regionals for other systems if our application is successful but we would hope the community supports us as such as we support the community.\n\n \n\nWe hold regular casual club nights for people to playtest their builds and help players improve their game ready for the big tournaments.\n\n \n\nHere is our Facebook page, please like and share https://www.facebook...ryGamingCentre/ [https://www.facebook.com/SanctuaryGamingCentre/]\n\n \n\nHere is our FFG Living Card Game Group https://www.facebook...35004836692861/ [https://www.facebook.com/groups/435004836692861/]\n\n \n\nCheers, Rich.\n\n "}]}
