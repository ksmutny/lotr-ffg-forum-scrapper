Is for all players in game. But the text is better if there is \"when revealed\" at starting, as you say.\n\nYes, you have to have all encounter cards from CORE to Cicle of Dwarrowelf. Lol. This quest is specially designed to OCTGN, but if players have got all the cards, sure they can play it. Enjoy!\n\nI want to create a Quest Sheet on tell about all the things, as 4 copies of Elven Alliance and 4 of Human Alliance, and display all icons sets, not only icons collection.\n\nI've played it alone twice. With the two better decks at the moment: powerdwarfs and outlanders. I won. And i played with other friend, me with outlanders and he with poweredwarfs, we won.\n\nMaybe it's a lot of difficult, but not much as Into Ithilien or Cair Andros. In these adventures, you also have to have powered decks.\n\nEdited July 25, 2013 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86963-fanmade-war-of-the-last-alliance-version-official/?do=findComment&comment=821596","commentId":821596,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1374750513,"content":"> It looks very interesting , but I will wait to see the rest of the cards in order to express my opinion :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nThere are all the cards of this encounter set.
