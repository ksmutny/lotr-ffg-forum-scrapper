But there's an official ruling by Caleb on a different question that's relevant here. That ruling was quoted in this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223378-hunt-for-gollum-timing-question-hunt-begins-signs-of-gollum/], and it reads:\n\n \n\n\"Forced effects do not trigger unless they are in play at the time that they would trigger. This is true for Response effects as well.\n\nCheers,\n\nCaleb\" (source [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187963-when-is-overcome-by-grief-first-triggered/?p=1971345])\n\n \n\nSo let's look at Helm's Deep. Stage 1B reads, in relevant part: \"Forced: At the end of the round, advance to stage 2A\". Stage 2B reads, in relevant part: \"Forced: At the end of the round place 1 progress here for each enemy in the staging area (bypassing the active location).\"\n\n \n\nNow, you're at the end of the round. Stage 1B is in play, and it will trigger. At this time, the end of the round, stage 2B is NOT YET in play. It comes into play because of triggering Stage 1B's Forced effect (which triggers at the end of the round) -- but that means that it was not in play when it would trigger.\n\n \n\nTherefore, this quest works precisely the way you would think. If you choose to go through stage 1, you get one free round of setup (and a free ally) at the cost of taking a burden card. But then you do indeed get that free round, and you will only trigger stage 2B's Forced effect at the end of round 2."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224494-assault-on-helms-deep-2b-forced-effect-after-stage-1a/?do=findComment&comment=2300563","commentId":2300563,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1467962528,"content":"Timing for \"end of round\" and \"end of phase\" has always seemed rather awkward to me.
