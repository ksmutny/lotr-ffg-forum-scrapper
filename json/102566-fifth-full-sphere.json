I don't see that there is really a unique sign space for the sphere given the framework of the game, and it would also affect the adventure pack card distribution. The latter is minor compared to the former, and if they were able to resolve the former I would like to see it eventually. But really the card pool is still pretty shallow and we still need to flesh out the existing spheres before adding another. And that goes for Neutral too even though it is \"not a sphere\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102566-fifth-full-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1030451","commentId":1030451,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1396021250,"content":"Although I share the consensus that a fifth sphere is probably not going to happen (and probably shouldn't), people did come up with some interesting ideas when I ran a \"create a fifth sphere\" contest.
