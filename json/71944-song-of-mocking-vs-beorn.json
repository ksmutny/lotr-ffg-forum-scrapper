Beorn is immune to player card effects, but SoM effects him only indirectly. Only the hero that has SoM attached is effected directly. Hence SoM might be used to protect Beorn. At least that's my interpretation.\n\n \n\nExample:\n\nLegolas has SoM attached. Beorn acts as a defender. He has already 9 damage tokens. Legolas exhausts SoM before Beorn is chosen as a defender. Beorn defends and his damage is taken by Legolas instead.\n\n \n\nPossible or impossible due to Beorns immunity to player card effects?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71944-song-of-mocking-vs-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=702241","commentId":702241,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1348908931,"content":"well dori works by the same reasoning so ill say yes\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71944-song-of-mocking-vs-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=702300","commentId":702300,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1348921145,"content":"\"choose a hero\"  is the key part here.

Perhaps I should build a deck around SoM, Dáin and Gimli. Gimli gets SoM and becomes a super dwarf while Dáin blocks all the tough guys.\n\nI'm curious btw, has anyone ever used SoM?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOh, and I think that if SoM doesn't work Dori also shouldn't. Because his card text includes the word \"hero\" which is Beorn and Beorn is immune to player card effects. I mean, you take the damage from Beorn. It's not worded like that in the cardtext, but it's what you do. So if I cannot \"choose\" Beorn, I also cannot take away damage from him.\n\n \n\nOkay, these card texts keep my head spinning fro time to time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71944-song-of-mocking-vs-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=702385","commentId":702385,"userName":"JasonRed3","timestamp":1348941013,"content":" I like Song of Mocking on Gloin… but be careful!  You have to use it as an Action, so if the damage turns out to be more than your Mocker can handle… tough luck!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71944-song-of-mocking-vs-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=702411","commentId":702411,"userName":"ArachneJericho","timestamp":1348945431,"content":" Original thread about Dori and Born: javascript:void(0);/*1348963418784*/ [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=702405&efpag=0]"}]}
