The oldest new heroes received the highest seeding. No new hero was added to the top of bottom 10.\n\n \n\nThe major change here is that we will now all be voting directly through Challonge. In order to vote, you must register to vote on the Challonge site. I think this is a good change, but it does potentially take away one of the features that I like best: reading the friendly banter and conversation on these forums. We'll see if that still happens, I'd love it if it did.\n\n \n\nVisit http://challonge.com/lotrhero2016 [http://challonge.com/lotrhero2016] for the bracket layout and voting.\n\n \n\nEach round is four days with voting closing at noon CST.\n\n \n\nEnding Dates are as follows:\n\nRound 1: Wednesday Dec 7\n\nRound 2: Sunday Dec 11\n\nRound 3: Thursday Dec 15\n\nRound 4: Monday Dec 19\n\nRound 5: Friday Dec 23   <---\n\nSemi-Finals: Tuesday Dec 27\n\nFinals: Saturday Dec 31 (voting closes at 11:59pm)\n\n \n\n \n\nShortly after, I'll post the results of each round on this thread.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2015 results: http://challonge.com/lotrhero2015 [http://challonge.com/lotrhero2015]\n\n2014 results: http://challonge.com/lotrhero2014 [http://challonge.com/lotrhero2014]\n\n2013 results: http://challonge.com/lotrhero [http://challonge.com/lotrhero]\n\nEdited December 19, 2016 by Thanatopsis"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2526211","commentId":2526211,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1480897987,"content":"Here are the Round 1 match-ups.\n\nIt looks like Challonge is letting us vote for the available Round 2 match-up as well.

Makes for some interesting decisions between them:\n\n \n\nLoragorn vs. Na'asiyah - Na'asiyah's ability is a more unusual one where Loragorn's is very simple but also very potent.\n\nHaldir vs. Bard - Both are good Ranged attackers, but Bard's ability is a straightforward better at ranged attacking while Haldir offers timing shenanigans and staging area hits.\n\nLegolas vs. Timrahil - Legolas is the classic Tactics hero, been around since the Core and very solid, while Timrahil offers new and exciting (if not perhaps as dependable) tricksy play to the Tactics sphere.\n\nBeregond vs. Caldara - If you wanted to pick out a hero as the epitome of dependable, you'd struggle to find better than Beregond. And equally it's hard to get tricksier than Caldara.\n\nBoromir vs. Spirit Merry - As Rajam said, Boromir is the classic OP but boring, whereas Spirit Merry enables Secrecy decks and other odd shenanigans.\n\n \n\nAnd then there are the matchups I'm actually finding difficult to pick for which also somewhat fit this pattern:\n\n \n\nSam vs. Hama - Hama's tricky, Sam's pretty straightforward and reliable. As I said in the first round of voting I've been enjoying Hama more lately, but equally who doesn't love Sam? I might pick Hama in the end just because I think by most people's perspectives he'll be a bit of an underdog.\n\n \n\nElrond vs. Theodred - That extra resource every round from Theodred is super reliable and powerful, but then on the flipside Elrond buffs healing, smooths resources between spheres and can use Vilya. I kind of want to go Theodred because he's so good and somewhat underappreciated, but Elrond wins out majorly on cool factor.\n\n \n\nGandalf vs. Leadership Gimli - Off the top of my head I'd say Gandalf is Caldara's only real competition for the title of 'Tricksiest hero in the game', whereas new Gimli offers a powerful but straightforward ability by contrast. Gimli gets a definite advantage from being shiny and new, and the ability definitely appeals, but I love some of the shenanigans-y stuff you can do with Gandalf and I know that even after two years I've still barely dipped a toe in the vast ocean of possibilities he offers."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2532621","commentId":2532621,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1481215729,"content":"Beregond (T) vs Caldara is all about general vs specialized.  Caldara is amazing in basically one deck.  Beregond is very good in many decks.  I would rather take the more general hero.  Although some of that is because I find the Caldara deck is too strong and - dare I say - boring after a few plays.\n\n \n\nLegolas (T) vs Prince Imrahil (T) is similar in a way.  You make \"a Prince Imrahil deck\" in the same way that you make \"a Caldara deck\", but there are more options with Imrahil since you aren't pigeon-holed into a single sphere like Caldara.  Meanwhile, while Beregond is the only hero with 4 defense (and sentinel), Legolas is one of 6 heroes that have 3 attack and ranged.  So in this case, my vote is for Imrahil.  Of course he is still new and shiny, so who knows what I would say next year.\n\n \n\nEomer vs Gloin is interesting.  Gloin is trying to be one of only 3 Dwarves to make it to the top 32, and it looks like no Dwarves will be in the top 16.  I think most people are bored with Dwarves, yet Gloin has the jank appeal.  Personally, I find his jank to be too difficult to set up, but then too game-breaking when it gets rolling.  Eomer, meanwhile, isn't very exciting unless he has Firefoot.  Nonetheless, I have been using Eomer lately with the new Imrahil, so he got my vote.\n\n \n\nGandalf vs Gilmi (Le) reminds me a little bit of Star Wars.  Gandalf is like the evil empire that is so ridiculously strong.  Gimli is the upstart underdog rebellion with limited abilities that everyone wants to root for.  Yet, despite the desire to root for the underdog, Gandalf is obviously so much better that even the PR disadvantage isn't enough to bring him down.\n\nEdited December 8, 2016 by Teamjimby"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2532781","commentId":2532781,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1481221915,"content":"4 closer matchups this time:\n\n \n\nBormoir (T) > Merry (S) - I like the powerhouse Gondorian.\n\n \n\nBeregond (T) > Caldara - Yeah Caldara has her Spirit deck and it is a good one and that's it. Beregond is just so much more useful in General. And playing a hero just to discard him disqualifies the hero for me him for me as soon as there is serious competition.

Faramir works with all sorts of allies. You can ready up utility allies like Gleowine or Warden of Healing or you can take various other allies with versatile statlines that aren't Ents, e.g. Gandalf, Elrond, Saruman, Gildor, Galdor, a bunch of Gondor allies if Boromir(Ld)/Visionary Leadership are in play, a bunhc of Dwarves if Dain is in play, Outlands if you really must play them, some Silvans on the round they enter play if Celeborn, some other Noldor if Lords of the Eldar has been played, maybe Northern Trackers, Wardens of Annuminas... there are so many options, and that's without even getting into the possibility of engaging things out of usual phases or exhausting allies for other reasons, like A Very Good Tale or some encounter card effects.\n\nAll that said, Frodo is really good and you're entirely justified in voting for him, but to say that Faramir \"only works with ents\" is simply not true.\n\n \n\nSo my take, extracting the most difficult decisions:\n\n \n\nSam Gamgee vs Merry (T)\n\nFrodo vs Faramir (Ld) - for all that impassioned support I just gave, this was a tough decision, but Faramir is a ton of fun.\n\nTheoden (S) vs Amarthiul - Dunedain are super fun, whereas I've never really gotten into Rohan.\n\nCirdan the Shipwright vs Erestor - Both are great, I give Cirdan the edge because of Narya (also I love the character).\n\nGandalf vs Glorfindel (S) - Gandalf is one of the most interesting heroes in the game, Glorfindel one of the most boring.\n\nElrond vs Elkenbrand - I like Erkenbrand, but Elrond is a long-standing favourite for so many reasons.\n\nHaldir of Lorien vs Dain Ironfoot - Again, interesting vs boring.\n\nLegolas (T) vs Pippin (Lo) - I've never understood this community's obsession with Legolas, but I'd rather have Pippin.\n\nBeregond (T) vs Gimli (T) - Maybe I'm bitter because Beregond beat Caldara, but also powering up Gimli with a mountain of hit points is a deeply satisfying combat solution.\n\nGaladriel vs Mablung - Everything is better with Galadriel.\n\nAragorn (T) vs Argalad - I just really like Argalad recently.\n\nÉomer vs Éowyn (T) - This isn't even a contest to me.\n\n \n\nAnd the really difficult choices:\n\n \n\nÉowyn (S) vs Celeborn\n\nEspecially have played Progression-style a lot, I get bored of Eowyn. But that aside, there's a reason she's still incredibly ubiquitous to this day, and it's because she's incredibly good. And she works just about anywhere, whereas Celeborn is pigeonholed into Silvan decks and Silvan decks only. As much as I kind of want to go against the norm, I think I have to give this one to Eowyn.\n\n \n\nAragorn (Lo) vs Beorn\n\nThese have been two of my favourite heroes for quite some time. Beorn I reckoned back in January to be the most pure fun hero in the game, but then that Loragorn threat reset is just so reliable, and so powerful for the kinds of crazy shenanigans it can enable. In the end I may have to give the nod to Loragorn just for his versatility, but it pains me to vote against the bear.\n\n \n\nArwen Undomiel vs Denethor (Ld)\n\nOh wow. This is like the Mablung/Beravor matchup from before, but on an even higher level. These are two of the absolute most powerful heroes in the game for how they help with one of the most central and fundamental aspects of the game - in this case resources for both of them. Looking at my decks on RingsDB (including some unfinished and unpublished ones), I have the same number of good/interesting decks with each of them. Denethor only provides 2 additional resources, and afterwards just helps with smoothing, but he provides those extra resources at the very beginning of the game, when they are absolutely most needed. Meanwhile Arwen offers a resource every round in exchange for a discarded card, which in some decks isn't really even a downside. Arwen's a good quester, Denethor's a decent defender. Denethor has a lower threat cost by 1.\n\n...is it possible for me to abstain from voting on one of the matchups? Because I'd seriously consider it at this point.\n\nLooks like it is, I can submit the votes I've already picked and it just leaves that one matchup still open for me to vote. Maybe I'll decide about this one later."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2537292","commentId":2537292,"userName":"Otherworlder","timestamp":1481506525,"content":"The really hard one for me is Aragorn (T) vs. Argalad: Argalad has done so much for my silvan deck and he is so useful.

There was not enough competition in the first two round (very few tight races and upsets). We spent the first two rounds in a sort-of meat grinder and now we're getting to the really good match-ups. This is a product of using prior years' results. The effects keep compounding. This has caused the worst heroes to make their to the bottom and stay there and the best to make there way to the top.\n\n \n\nI almost did this by sphere. The top four would then be composed of one representative form each sphere. I opted not to this in the final hour because I felt the variation in match-ups would be inhibited. For instance we wouldn't get great match-ups like Ciridan and Erestor or Arwen and Denethor. I really like the idea of having wildly different heroes facing off.\n\n \n\nMaybe each sphere could send 4 heroes. The top 16 would then be re-seeded. That wouldn't make the competition any longer to finish and it would allow for early in-sphere fighting. I guess that is sort-of how NCAA basketball works. Most of the games are in-conference and then top teams from each conference are re-seeded into the March bracket (I know it doesn't quite work that way).\n\n \n\nI really like the idea of excluding past winners"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2540628","commentId":2540628,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1481666551,"content":"I'd be down for excluding past winners.

Still going to shift the more interesting ones to the bottom though.\n\n \n\nSam Gamgee vs Boromir (T) - This is incredibly simple for me. Boromir is boring, Sam is great.\n\n \n\nElrond vs Aragorn (Lo) - I am actually a massive fan of Loragorn, and he's let me do some truly ridiculous things over the many games I've used him, but Elrond is also amazing. Vilya of course is incredibly powerful, but even just Elrond's own innate abilities I keep finding more and more useful over time. Incidentally I love that about this game that I'm still gaining additional appreciation for a hero who's been around longer than I've been playing the game.\n\n \n\nGandalf vs Haldir of Lorien - Haldir is a ton of fun, but Gandalf, as I've noted in previous rounds, can do just about anything. The level of power, efficiency and incredible variety Gandalf can offer your deckbuilding is just so difficult to match.\n\n \n\nLegolas (T) vs Arwen Undómiel - Another easy one for me. Legolas is just a strong attacker with a nice ability. Arwen's resource generation is super-powerful and enables so many different decks.\n\n \n\nBeregond (T) vs Galadriel - Similar to the above. Beregond is good, but all he is is a (very) strong defender. Galadriel's incredible support abilities just make so many things work so much better.\n\n \n\nAnd the difficult ones for me this round:\n\n \n\nFrodo Baggins vs Éowyn (S) - Frodo is a great hero, and there's a part of me which really wants to vote against Eowyn given how ubiquitous she is, but she really is just that good, so getting past my tendency to go against the grain, she really is the better choice.\n\n \n\nAragorn (T) vs Éowyn (T) - I haven't actually used Tactics Aragorn that much, bbut I know how amazing he is. I've used Tactics Eowyn even less, but she's also an incredibly powerful hero. Eowyn offers Tactics something fairly unique and opens up a bunch of new deckbuilding possibilities for the sphere. Aragorn meanwhile, though he does offer some new options, mostly just does the standard Tactics things; it's just that he does them incredibly well (I would argue better than any other hero). That makes it pretty hard to choose between the two, but I picked Aragorn because he helped me beat Siege of Annuminas yesterday.\n\n \n\nAmarthiúl vs Cirdan the Shipwright - And this one I haven't voted on yet. Neither of these heroes quite makes it into my list of favourites, but they're both somewhat on the cusp I'd say. Amarthiul I really tend to take as a representative of the Dunedain deck archetype as a whole, and I've had a lot of fun with that archetype, plus he's gained favour of late in combination with Elfhelm/Armoured Destrier; whereas Cirdan offers that extra deck speed/filtering and can use Narya, not to mention the 4 willpower, plus he has a truly epic beard. I like Cirdan more as a character I suppose. Mechanics-wise while Cirdan is obviously more flexible and widely applicable, Amarthiul I think arguably has more going for him in and of himself. It would be unreasonable to consider Cirdan without also considering Narya though, and Narya is a pretty big deal. I could still go either way on this one, though unlike Denethor vs. Arwen last round I do intend to actually cast a vote before the round ends."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2550283","commentId":2550283,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1482180467,"content":"ROUND 5 voting has begun!\n\n \n\nVoting closes at noon CST Friday Dec 23\n\n \n\nSam Gamgee [1] v Éowyn (S) [9]\n\nCírdan the Shipwright [13] v Elrond [5]\n\nGandalf [2] v Arwen Undomiel [10]\n\nGaladriel [14] v Aragorn (T) [6]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2550382","commentId":2550382,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1482183837,"content":"Sam vs Eowyn (S) - Both heroes are quite good and both heroes are old news by now.  Eowyn might be the stronger hero, but she has competition for dedicated questers.  Sam, meanwhile, has a totally unique ability and is the lynchpin of many decks.\n\n \n\nCirdan vs Elrond - I'm surprised Cirdan made it this far, beating out Erestor and Amarthiul.  His 4 WP is great and access to Narya is also great.  I just don't see him played nearly as much as Elrond.  While Vilya is boring to me, Elrond's healing boost is a life saver, especially in 3-4 player games.\n\n \n\nGandalf vs Arwen - My hatred of Gandalf is well documented.  Arwen (either hero or ally version) seems to be in almost every game I play these days.\n\n \n\nGaladriel vs Aragorn (T) - Two really fun heroes.  I'll go with Aragorn's supremely entertaining ability over Galadriel's tools.  The fact that Galadriel can't do any fighting or questing on her own has frustrated me enough times to tip the scales against her.\n\n \n\nI find it interesting that we have 4 spirit heroes and only 1 of each other sphere (plus neutral).  And that is even without the ubiquitous Glorfindel.  Spirit simultaneously has some of the best heroes in the game and several of the worst (Fatty, Pippin, Oin, Dwalin)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2550432","commentId":2550432,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1482185157,"content":"> I find it interesting that we have 4 spirit heroes and only 1 of each other sphere (plus neutral).  And that is even without the ubiquitous Glorfindel.  Spirit simultaneously has some of the best heroes in the game and several of the worst (Fatty, Pippin, Oin, Dwalin).\n\n \n\nYea, I was really surprised when I realized we had a Spirit hero in each pairing this round.  \n\n \n\nSam vs Eowyn (S) - Like I said previously, Eowyn all the way!\n\nCirdan vs Elrond - The card cycling and 4 WP are enough to push him above Elrond.  When I consider their tools - Vilya vs Nenya - I actually like Nenya more.  Sure, Vilya is strong, but I just don't care for the blind aspect without also requiring Gandalf to be present. \n\nGandalf vs Arwen - this was easily the hardest vote for me.  Gandalf is easily one of my favorite heroes to play, but he really requires so many tools and such much dedicated deck space, where Arwen just works right out of the gate and is just better if you manage to draw Elven Light.   \n\nGladriel vs Aragorn (T) - Aragorn is a murder machine, but I've found Tactics can already murder things well without him.  Galadriel offers some interesting abilities and uses out of your allies, so she takes the pick."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2550496","commentId":2550496,"userName":"Calyx","timestamp":1482187189,"content":"It is because of people like Slothgodfather that we have 50% Spirit heroes left (well, also all of those heroes are really strong).\n\n \n\nFor me, this round of voting was by far the easiest - not a single difficult decision:\n\n \n\nSam vs Eowyn (S) - Obviously both of these heroes are quite strong, and Eowyn I think still retains the questing crown, though her hold has been getting more and more tenuous. Sam, however, brings strong willpower to Leadership, where he is fairly unique. I find myself using Sam far more often then Eowyn.\n\n \n\nCirdan vs Elrond - Like Teamjimby above, I am also surprised that Cirdan made it this far. Obviously he is a good hero, but I consider both Amarthiul and especially Erestor to have significantly greater impact on the game. Regardless, his unexpected rise has to end here. Elrond is just better. I love building Elrond decks, especially those without Vilya.\n\n \n\nGandalf vs Arwen - Gandalf shouldn't really be a hero, but since he is I built a deck with him one time. It was fun for the first 2-3 quests I used it on, so I built another one... which was almost exactly the same. No hero takes up more dedicated deck space than Gandalf, and that is what makes him boring - I'm not saying that you can't build differently with him, I'm just saying there is really no point. Arwen, on the other hand, opens up a huge deckbuilding space that has been really fun to explore.\n\n \n\nGaladriel vs Aragorn (T) - Both of these heroes are quite fun and very powerful, despite being essentially diametric opposites. Galadriel helps any deck along in fairly subtle ways, while Aragorn... kills everything. I have to say that I enjoy building decks with Aragorn a lot more. Both heroes offer many possibilities and enable new strategies, but only Aragorn is generally the centerpiece of a deck.\n\n \n\nIf everyone votes as I have - and so far the heroes I have chosen are actually winning - we will get a final four representing one hero from each sphere, which would be fantastic. Hopefully Elrond will finally become the champion as he deserves, though I'm not sure how I would vote in an Elrond/Aragorn match up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2550624","commentId":2550624,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1482191364,"content":"Sam Gamgee vs Éowyn (S)\n\nI don't use any of these heroes very often... I never go mono-leadership, and when I think in including leadership (for stuff like Steward or Sneak attack+Gandalf), I think in access to resource generation, and thus I want to include guys like Denethor or Amarthiúl. When I think in spirit, I think in stuff like test of will, unexpected courage, threat reduction, etc... and although I'd rather prefer Arwen, Galadriel or Glorfindel over Éowyn, I like her more than Sam.

He is definitely solid, and Narya is awesome... but Elrond is just better. Well, at least I like him more and I've had much more success with him. Vilya is just broken.\n\n \n\nGandalf vs Arwen\n\nugh, both these guys are top 5 heroes imo... the main issue with Gandalf is that you can't use his ally versions. Threat doesn't even matter with those stats, abilities and toys (Narya & Word of command!!). I agree with previous comments saying Gandalf requires decks running around him, meanwhile Arwen is much more versatile and adaptable. mmm honestly this is a tie for me. My choice is because I play solo, I play power decks, and I think Gandalf has a tiny advantage in that regard.\n\n \n\nGaladriel vs Aragorn (T)\n\nThey are so different in what they offer and therefore is hard to establish comparison points. Galadriel is always an option when I build decks, and that's the main reason for my vote here. Consistent threat reduction is a hard thing to find even in today's meta. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2551043","commentId":2551043,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1482214374,"content":"Sam vs Eowyn: No contest, Sam is just a lot more interesting.  Eowyn is more universally useful, but Sam has a more significant impact on your gameplay and makes you walk that threat balancing line.\n\n \n\nCirdan vs Elrond: A close one for me as Elrond is a superbly useful hero and makes it into many of my decks, even though I almost never use Vilya.  Guy should be 15 threat with his abilities.  But unlike others, I am not surprised that Cirdan made it this far.  He is Bilbo Baggins for your deck in a multiplayer setting, even though you have to discard one of the cards you draw.  I run him without recursion all the time. 4 willpower is great, but this is a flexible hero, don't be fooled: he is a high priority target for Light of Valinor and has a \"jack of all trades\" statline outside of his 4 willpower, so you can use his stats even if you aren't running a Narya deck.  With Narya it's a whole different ballgame, as often I am conflicted and have some fun decision-making to do about which two allies to ready.  Always fun to defend with an ally, use Narya before the attack resolves, then have that ally ready to attack with +1 attack and able to resolve the attack with the +1 defense stat as well.\n\n \n\nGandalf vs. Arwen: Arwen is a great hero who solves the resource problem for many decks.  Pair her with tactics Aragorn and you've got a tactics resource engine who isn't Mablung (as long as you can fund her with cards).\n\n \n\nGaladriel vs Aragorn: Go Aragorn!

However, I do think you undervalue Sam. Denethor will always be making a solid contribution, and in the right deck his turn 1 resources can offset the willpower loss from not including Sam. However, sometimes you just need willpower on a hero - maybe your deck doesn't have a ton of allies, maybe your other heroes are low on willpower, maybe you just can't rely on luck of the draw for your turn 1 questing.  Sam does fit in some decks better than Denethor.\n\n \n\nIt is nice to finally have options for the leadership splashing hero, though. Also, my Sam-Denethor-Aragorn deck is amazing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2552934","commentId":2552934,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1482295219,"content":"Matchup Spotlight!\n\n \n\nWisdom versus Beauty \n\n \n\nGandalf versus Arwen\n\n \n\nGandalf.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Road-Darkens/Gandalf.jpg]Arwen-Und%C3%B3miel.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Dread-Realm/Arwen-Und%C3%B3miel.jpg]\n\n \n\nI tracked Gandalf down in the midst of battle and pulled him off to the sidelines for a quick interview.  After he brushed what I can only assume to be the remains of burnt orc off his sleeves, I asked him to explain why he is a stronger hero than Arwen.\n\n \n\nGandalf: While it is true that Arwen is the fairest elf in all of Middle-Earth, I must remind the voting public of my many achievements:\n\n-Prepared to stymie Sauron's attempts at world domination for 2000 years\n\n-Successfully infiltrated Dol Guldur TWICE\n\n-Put into motion the Quest for Erebor, a chain of events which removed Smaug from the Lonely Mountain \n\n-Discovered the treachery of Saruman and lived to tell the tale\n\n-Mobilized the entire West against Sauron in the War of the Ring\n\n-Slew a frickin' Balrog\n\n-RETURNED TO LIFE\n\n-Rescued the Ring-bearer after successful completion of his mission (as a courtesy, and with some help)\n\n \n\nAnd against that list, I would compare the achievements and reason for fame of the lady Arwen:\n\n-was born\n\n-is hot\n\n-made a banner\n\n \n\nLastly, I acknowledge that some call my play style \"boring\" for its sheer power, or because the Planning phase may take... a small bit longer than usual when I am around.  However, this is appropriately thematic because I am the planner to end all planners.  \n\n \n\n-------------------\n\n \n\nAfter speaking with Gandalf, I tracked down Arwen in a sitting room at the Last Homely House.  I asked her why she is a stronger hero than Gandalf.  Her answer:\n\n \n\nArwen: <editor's note: Arwen does not have speaking lines until after Sauron is overthrown>\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSo there you have it, folks.  Oh I should mention Arwen can give you resources!\n\nVote wisely!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2553143","commentId":2553143,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1482320178,"content":"Interestingly, this round wasn't actually that difficult for me.\n\n \n\nSam Gamgee vs. Éowyn\n\nThis was the most difficult choice. I love Sam, while Eowyn I can get a bit tired of since she has been in such a multitude of decks as the premier quester since the Core Set. On the other hand, well, she has been the premier quester since the Core Set. She is just that good. I have a lot of fun with Sam at times, but I could say that about almost any hero in the game.\n\n \n\nCírdan the Shipwright vs. Elrond\n\nI love Cirdan. I love his interesting status as the oldest elf in Middle Earth, the only elf we ever meet described as having a beard, his wisdom in giving Narya to Gandalf, and the interesting setting of the Grey Havens, of which he is obviously the representative. That's in story terms of course, in gameplay he's also very useful, though the main thing which stands out for me there is Narya - also a card I love, not least for the fact it's so much like the custom Narya I designed years ago. On the other hand, Elrond has Vilya; it's more powerful and also very interesting, sometimes for similar reasons (in fact those two rings can work quite well together). And then besides that there are Elrond's own innate abilities, which continue to demonstrate their incredible potency in making Elrond a very strong pick even in the absence of Vilya. The ability to bring in allies from other spheres lends great flexibility to a deck either in smoothing out resources between spheres or in allowing access to out of sphere allies - that this is very powerful should be much less of a surprise in the wake of the increased popularity of A Good Harvest. And then healing has obviously been gaining a lot more significance for a while as it has become that much easier in a lot of more recent quests to take damage one way or another. Elrond is just so all-round great and deserves recognition for that.\n\n \n\nGandalf vs. Arwen Undomiel\n\nI fully accept that there are very strong arguments in favour of Arwen. I don't dispute those arguments. What I do continue to find very strange are the arguments against Gandalf - in particular the one brought up multiple times on this page, that he takes up a lot of dedicated deck space and is limited in what decks he works in. I think I may have said something to this effect a few pages back as well, but even if so, it bears repeating - if you build multiple decks with Gandalf and find them all the same, then you are doing something wrong. If you find Gandalf inflexible in what decks he can work in for reasons other than his threat cost, then you are doing something wrong. A little way up this post I talked up the incredible value of Elrond's ability to play out of sphere allies - Gandalf lets you play out of sphere everything. I don't see how you can see a hero with the ability to let you play literally any card in the game (barring other play restrictions) as anything other then incredibly versatile.\n\nPart of this I think is a mistake in terms of perception of the hero. A lot of people don't build decks with Gandalf, they build Gandalf decks, and throw in all the Gandalf toys, which I'll grant you is a fair number of toys. But here's the thing - just because Gandalf has amazing stats and the highest threat cost of any hero in the game doesn't mean he needs to be the focus of your deck. If you look at his ability, it really doesn't support turning him into a powerhouse the way the abilities of heroes like Boromir or Treebeard do. His ability grants resource-smoothing and effective card draw. Look at his text box and Gandalf appears to be a support hero, and so in fact he is - albeit a support hero with amazing stats, 14 threat cost and a suite of toys to let him do fairly impressive things in his own right. As far as dedicated deck slots go, Wizard Pipe is hard to do without because it makes Gandalf's ability so much more reliable (though I think decks could be built which wouldn't need it); and Gandalf's Staff I would always include, but that's because the Staff is another support card which like Gandalf himself, just makes your (or someone else's) deck run more efficiently in the long run, by drawing cards or generating resources. Plus it can discard shadow cards if you have combat concerns. The other Gandalf toys are nice, but not actually required for a lot of decks.\n\nAs an illustration of my point about the potential variety Gandalf can offer, I searched through my own RingsDB decks for ones where I've used hero Gandalf - 5 different decks (some with multiple iterations), none of which devote that much deckspace to Gandalf, and all of which play rather differently:\n\nhttp://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1449/the-charge-of-harrowdale-2.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1449/the-charge-of-harrowdale-2.0]\n\nhttp://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/813/gloin-s-attachment-emporium-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/813/gloin-s-attachment-emporium-1.0]\n\nhttp://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1006/we-are-such-stuff-as-dreams-are-made-on-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1006/we-are-such-stuff-as-dreams-are-made-on-1.0]\n\nhttp://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1552/smoking-buddies-solo-campaign-5.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1552/smoking-buddies-solo-campaign-5.0]\n\nhttp://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/3459/the-invisible-army-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/3459/the-invisible-army-1.0]\n\n \n\nArwen is much-loved by the community, and rightfully so because she is amazing. There are entirely valid reasons to vote for her in this matchup or any other up to and potentially including the final, but to say that she's more versatile and adaptable, or opens up more deckbuilding space, than Gandalf, the hero who can do literally anything, is franky absurd.\n\n \n\nGaladriel vs. Aragorn\n\nEverything is better with Galadriel.

Yes, he's powerful, and there are legitimate reasons to vote for him in any matchup he faces, including this one. But there is a reason Arwen has 16 pages of decks on ringsdb to Gandalf's 7, and it isn't all due to newness or the lack of people understanding Gandalf.\n\n \n\nGandalf has a threat cost of 14, and once you've chosen him as a hero you pretty much do have a \"Gandalf Deck\" whether you like or not, because you've signed yourself up for high-threat deck (or some 2-hero or hobbit deck). Now, there's a ton of space within those archetypes, but Arwen has a lot more breathing room for hero selection.\n\n \n\nAnd if Gandalf's Staff/Pipe gets to be part of the discussion (which they should), then so does Elven-light. With Arwen it's essentially repeatable card draw and resource acceleration in Spirit, the two things they most struggled with.\n\n \n\nI have discovered many new deck archetypes thanks to Arwen that never worked before, and didn't work with Gandalf. Sure, he can play any card in the game, but that doesn't automatically translate into deck versatility. And if that's the main reason you're including him, then he isn't worth the threat cost in my opinion. \n\n \n\nSo yes, Arwen is more adaptable and versatile, and opens up more deckbuilding space than Gandalf, and that's why I voted for her. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2556998","commentId":2556998,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1482524033,"content":"Nice, the next round of voting has started.  I was going into voting withdrawal :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2557032","commentId":2557032,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1482526181,"content":"Sam vs Elrond - Tough choice, but as a Hobbit player I decided to go with Sam.  Either way, I expect the winner of this match up to lose in the finals.\n\n \n\nArwen vs Aragorn (T) - Another tough one.  While Arwen is very powerful, she is powerful in a generic sort of way (resource and card advantage) that doesn't excite me.  She's the kind of card you use if your #1 goal is to win.  Aragorn unlocks a totally different play style that I find highly enjoyable.  He's the kind of card you use if your #1 goal is to have fun.  Also, I really like the Arwen ally and I'm sad that I can't reliably use her anymore."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2557049","commentId":2557049,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1482526832,"content":"I think we're seeing Elrond in the finals.  Elrond versus Arwen or Elrond versus Aragorn, either one will be a fun pairing.\n\n \n\nGo Aragorn!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2557777","commentId":2557777,"userName":"Veve7","timestamp":1482582693,"content":"Sam\n\nArwen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2557818","commentId":2557818,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1482586709,"content":"In the first one, I couldn't decide between the two, so I applied the \"nobody wins more than one time\" policy and voted for Elrond.\n\nThe second one was even thougher.

I think you know what time it is. Time to give Elrond the title he should have earned years ago!!\n \n\nIf he actually loses to Arwen it will be ridiculous. Yes she is shiny and new, yes she is amazing and yes she helps ramp resources and card draw big time but Elrond is just the ultimate hero and has been ever since his release. \n\nHe boosts healing across the board just by being in play and you can massively take advantage of this with cards that allow healing across multiple characters or quests that have locations with beneficial effects such as across the ettenmoors (heal 1 from every character when you travel to one of the Safe locations) by healing an extra point across multiple characters at a time rather than just one. Something as simple as Galadrim Healer for example can heal a whopping 6 damage off your heroes instead of 3 just from Elrond's boost. \n\nHe can pay for allies from ANY sphere. If that isn't one of the best resource smoothing abilities in the game I don't know what is. He can quest, defend and even attack so can fulfil a wide variety of roles. What does Arwen do? Quest quest and oh some more questing. Elrond with Vilya is insanely powerful and not only does it let you play cards for free but also gives Elrond the spirit sphere allowing him to pay for spirit events and attachments (he can already pay for spirit allies). He is a fantastic recipient for Burning Brand, Elven Mail, Gondorian Shield, Steward of Gondor considering he can pay for any allies) and countless other attachments and is even one of the best targets in the game for LoV.\n\nElrond has several powerful effects that are game changers in both solo and multiplayer. He goes the distance in almost every single aspect or regard and is an all round powerful hero that can be buffed with the vast majority of available attachments (Noble trait helps here). With Vilya he can even turn a mediocre deck into an extremely powerful one.

With Arwen, you just need any other card in your hand - which you'll have - and a Northern Tracker and you can get them down first turn.  I've actually let a friend use my Caldara deck before and for the fun of it I went through the experiment of what is the most optimal opening hand/next several cards, and it is indeed crazy powerful.   "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2565252","commentId":2565252,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1483128183,"content":"The thing about Arwen and Caldara is that the best sidekick for Caldara is...
