One of the main reason is that sooooo many cards in this encounter deck have the keyword \"surge\". This is especially painfull, when you loose your timecounters in stage two (which we try really hard to aviod but you know it happens sometimes) and have to reveal two cards per player. At this point we have a rule question. Surge ist descriced in the rulebook like that:\n\n \n\nSurge:\n \nWhen an encounter card with the surge keyword is\nrevealed during the staging step of the quest phase or in\nsetup, reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck.\nResolve the surge keyword immediately after resolving\n\nany when revealed effects on the card.\n\n \n\nI have highlighted the important section of this describtion. If you loose your last time counter at the end of a round, you're neither in the quest phase nor in setup. So let's say we are 3 players and have to reveal 6 cards, do we have to \"surge\" if we draw a card with that keyword or can we ignore it?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134171-surge-outside-of-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=1437410","commentId":1437410,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1423214903,"content":"That's the old definition of surge from the core set.\n\nSurge happen whenever the phase.\n\n \n\nThis cycle, playing with more than 2 people was just crazy.
