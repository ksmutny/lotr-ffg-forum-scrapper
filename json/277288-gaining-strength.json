Doomed with legacy of numenor, trait for the vast majority of them and here you have to already have 2 resource to gain another one. You have to wait or to use it in combo with other cards. That an important part of the balanced of this card. The way you write it you can always win the third resource AND move resource from a hero to another with this effect. It would be really more powerful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277288-gaining-strength/?do=findComment&comment=3364508","commentId":3364508,"userName":"bitzurock","timestamp":1528368140,"content":"Thanks!"}]}
