Frankly, I actually think that it's a rather ingenious way to represent his xenophobia and isolationism - he doesn't quest, he doesn't attack, he just sits back and defends his realm. Much like Denethor, really. I think that Denethor's stat line and Thranduil's are similar for the same reasons, and I think they represent a decent abstraction of the two characters.\n\nFor me, I'm excited to try an Elves of Mirkwood deck.

Maybe it's supposed to be, unles anyone knows another unique character named Thalion in the lore?\n\nThalion means strong, steadfast or dauntless in Sindarin and is a title of Húrin [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Hurin-FA], father of Túrin Turambar [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Turin-Turambar-FA]. Of course he has lived in the First Age and is long since dead.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3566539","commentId":3566539,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1544744406,"content":"> 4 hours ago, GILLIES291 said:\n> \n> I had to double check the spelling too.

(Caleb in Hebrew meaning something like steadfast)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3566690","commentId":3566690,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1544762876,"content":"Are there any unspoiled cards from this pack?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3566715","commentId":3566715,"userName":"player1683311","timestamp":1544766536,"content":"I am pretty sure this thread,\n\nshows the remaining cards that had not been spoiled yet"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3605003","commentId":3605003,"userName":"DarkPhoenix","timestamp":1548684045,"content":"Wait, so his action is just plop ally into play?

The ability means that you can use resources of any type to do so.\n\nI think the most powerful part of it is that you get to do it as a combat action."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3605047","commentId":3605047,"userName":"DarkPhoenix","timestamp":1548685459,"content":"> 4 minutes ago, rees263 said:\n> \n> No, you still have to pay for the ally.
