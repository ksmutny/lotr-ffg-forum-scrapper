He can't leave the staging area, so even though his engagement is less than my threat, he's not engaged (nor ever anywhere considered engaged), so doesn't attack during the enemy phase. And his Forced ability doesn't trigger after I explore a location because I can't return him to the staging area when he's already there.

It could just say that the FD makes an attack at the end of each travel phase in Stage 2B, since that is essentially what would happen. And, yes, 3B is different, since you may have FD engaged in combat so it could get bounced back to staging. It sure makes a big difference since it takes a while to get through 2B!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278777-spoiler-kings-quest-stage-2/?do=findComment&comment=3396302","commentId":3396302,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1530856463,"content":"It does give you some amount of control over how often the Drake attacks.

You are definitely not guaranteed to explore an active location every round as you can just ignore travelling and even putting progress on the quest altogether.\n\nThis gives you some fun deck construction choices before the quest even starts. Do you build a deck with lots of cards that let you explore locations in the staging area? Do you Build a deck with one super defender that can just take a dragon attack every round if you are exploring locations the normal way? Do you build a deck that just has massive willpower that  ignores the threat of those locations in the staging area? You probably should be able to do it all just to be safe :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. This seems like a quest that wants you to build a specific deck for it, especially with the beneficial effects on Lost Armory and Dragon Hoard that require you have specific type cards to work.\n\nEdited July 6, 2018 by donkler"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278777-spoiler-kings-quest-stage-2/?do=findComment&comment=3397058","commentId":3397058,"userName":"CDavis7M","timestamp":1530913434,"content":"> 7 hours ago, donkler said:\n> \n> ...especially with the beneficial effects on Lost Armory and Dragon Hoard that require you have specific type cards to work.\n\nRight?
