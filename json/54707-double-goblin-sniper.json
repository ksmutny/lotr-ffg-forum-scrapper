Otherwise, playing 2-deck games, both parties rarely have enough threat reduction to make 25 or less threat cost Enemies stay in the staging area. Actually, I've never seen that in plays yet. More often than not, with Dunhere's deck of starting threat 25 paired with any of the other three with starting threat 29, Enemies will be engaging the other deck almost from turn 1. Or otherwise I just engage the Enemy myself (like Marsh Adder, who Dunhere could snipe away, but who also has 3 threat) and kill it in one attack. Other Enemies, meaning the tough ones (Hill Troll, Trolls from Carrock, etc.), he is too weak to do much if anything to on his own. Hell, he needs 2 turns just against measly Wargs!!! So needs boosting, which almost always is wasted on him, might as well put those Marks on some other hero who does more attacking.\n\nGoing over the list of Enemies with engagement cost of 30 or more that Dunhere could do something about (beyond those mentioned): Eastern Crows (but really, you probably want to engage them and not kill them), Dol Guldur Beast Master (2 turns), Hunters from Mordor (umm, yeah right, you don't want them putting up 6-8 threat in the staging area) plus a couple of Osgiliath. That's not really a worthwile list IMO, Snipers and Hummerhorns he is nice against, rest are better engaged and killed right away or left engaged (Crows).\n\nI imagine it a solo game, Dunhere gets more of a chance to shine since you only need threat reduction for one deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54707-double-goblin-sniper/?do=findComment&comment=541896","commentId":541896,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1318583717,"content":"Well, I can say that in my solo Anduin win it was only because I had Dunhere picking off enemies in the staging area the whole time.

However, the card reads a player cannot \"optionally engage\" the sniper if another enemy is in the staging area. However, Dunhere works well against these guys.
