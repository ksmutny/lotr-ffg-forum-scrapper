My first question on the game is the “Forced” rule on the Forest Spider. Yeah I know, I did not get very far before I ran in to troubles =P\n\nAnyhow the card reads “Forced: After Forest Spider engages a player, it gets +1 attack” so my question is if I decide to engage him first (I think it’s in the 5ed phase) before we do the threat check to see if it engages, do he still get the +1 attack?\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70333-forest-spider-forced/?do=findComment&comment=686457","commentId":686457,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1346573839,"content":"yes thats correct- when a card says 'when engages' it also means 'when engaged'\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70333-forest-spider-forced/?do=findComment&comment=686461","commentId":686461,"userName":"Bahoola","timestamp":1346574044,"content":"Wow super fast reply, nice to see that’s its note only a living card game, it’s a living forum as well! =D\n\nAnd thx for the help mate!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70333-forest-spider-forced/?do=findComment&comment=686463","commentId":686463,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1346574159,"content":"Bahoola said:\n\nWow super fast reply, nice to see that’s its note only a living card game, it’s a living forum as well! =D\n\nAnd thx for the help mate!\n\n\n\nno worries- im like a forum robot- just lurking here waiting for a post haha (well it is a sunday)\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70333-forest-spider-forced/?do=findComment&comment=686528","commentId":686528,"userName":"VTSvsAlucard","timestamp":1346587045,"content":" This is usually followed by \"If I engage Hummerhorns, does their Forced effect still trigger?\" And yes, yes it does.
