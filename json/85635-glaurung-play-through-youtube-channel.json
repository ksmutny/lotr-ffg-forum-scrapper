I have 2 core set so I use only 2 copies of u courage and 2 copies of dwarven tomb.\n\nYou can replace some cards it will effect but no so much"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85635-glaurung-play-through-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=953137","commentId":953137,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1389621926,"content":"> As always great playthrough Glaurung. Wish I could build this deck but I only have one core set... oh well...\n\nIf you want to try the deck with just one core set and are opposed to using proxies, here is what i would suggest doing for the 6 cards you would need to replace.\n\nI would put in Miruvor x3\n\nI can see a nice combo if this is played on Dunhere and you have Foe Hammer in hand. After you declare Dunhere as an attacker ready him with Miruvor and put it back on top of your deck. After you destroy the enemy play Foe Hammer. Get Miruvor back in hand with 2 more cards, and then Dunhere is ready to attack again.\n\nThat should take care of the missing 2 UC.\n\nFeint, Light in the dark, Galadhrim's Greeting only come with 2 copies in core set and you only have 1 Dwarven tomb.\n\nSince you only need 3 cards since you added an extra Miruvor\n\nI think I would add 2 Map of Earnil to play the roll of the missing Dwarven Tomb. I put an extra Map in since you will be able to fetch back copies of Light in the Dark or the Greeting since there are no replacement cards for those in the deck. It will cost 2 to play, but should not be an issue. Especially it you get Song of Travel on Merry.\n\nTo take the roll of the last Feint, you could add quick strike which would allow Dunhere to possibly dispatch the enemy before it attacks. Also if the Miruvor does not seem to work as intended I would remove 1 and add a second QS.\n\nHope that helps, and If you do try it let me know how it goes. It is a fun deck and I think replacing the six cards as suggested will not alter how it plays too much. I would be curious if it could handle MV with these modifications."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85635-glaurung-play-through-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=953147","commentId":953147,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1389623303,"content":"Thanks!

Dice is perfect for resources and progress. You can also use different colours dice green for progress and red for wounds.

In the first game, when Glorifindel died I believe you had A Test of Will in hand along with A Good Harvest and one resource on Hama. So I think you could have saved Glory there. It was going to be a tough go anyway though.\n\nIn the second game at about 24 minutes, you used A Test of Will to cancel the when revealed effect of a Quest card. (At least I think so, you play fast!). Anyway, that is explicitly prohibited.\n\nNow, about a minute later you use A Good Harvest again to play out Eagles of the Misty Mountains. I'm not so sure about this one: A Good Harvest reads, \"Name a sphere. Until the end of the phase, you can spend resources of any sphere when paying for cards that belong to the named sphere.\" The thing is, Gandalf's resources are neutral and \"don't belong to a sphere\" according to a previous ruling, so I don't think you can use Gandalf's resources with A Good Harvest. I'm really unsure about this one though.

Seems as though Glaurung himself is just as likely to make mistakes as they are, that are just as quickly picked up by community members. It is a complex game for sure and no one is immune to making mistakes on occasion. I have to say I agree with what was said in the podcast in that playing with actual physical cards (as opposed to OCTGN) is better in this particular regard in that you can more easily spot or avoid mistakes with the cards right there in front of you. I personally have a laminated copy of the kaybee quick reference guide (http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf]) that I have next to me during every game as a quick reference to avoid mistakes whenever possible. No offense intended to Glaurung but the fact he plays with physical cards (not to mention his feelings about nightmare and constant declaration that the game is too easy/not worth playing without nightmare cards) he kind of has less excuse than they do in regards to making mistakes.\n\nHonestly I think there are probably a small handful of players on the forums that are real sticklers for rules and play every game very slowly and carefully and make almost no mistakes but the vast majority of us are prone to making mistakes on occasion especially when playing new quests or quests we have not played many times before, or when we are under time constraints (which for sure both Glaurung with his young daughter and job and the Grey company guys with their busy lives often have) or even just when playing quests with a more complex and shifting board state (Antlered Crown, Dunland Trap etc). I think that occasional mistakes is something that needs to just be accepted with this game especially when they are made by people like the Grey Company guys or Glaurung considering the vast wealth of knowledge we know that they have of the game and the amazing resources they provide us with like their videos or podcasts or events.\n\nEdited August 17, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85635-glaurung-play-through-youtube-channel/?do=findComment&comment=1739373","commentId":1739373,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1439805902,"content":"Yes you right.
