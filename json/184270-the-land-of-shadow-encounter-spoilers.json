I love how similar the Oliphaunt is to the Mumak from Heirs but a little weaker (and for good reason! the Mumak was brutal!) but with a very cool forced effect! \n\nThe second quest just looks amazing. Slowly working your way through the 9 harad encounter set cards/enemies travelling from the crossroads to the black gate. Then once they are all clear/have made their way to the black gate your passage is clear and you can advance to the crossroads. The choice between extra resources and the boon card is also a very interesting and hard choice. Also the locations with all the beneficial effects are just awesome and so thematic considering for once we are ambushing the enemy and not the other way around!! (into ithilien does this too but not very well in my opinion). The art on the locations looks like it is really nice too, kinda hard to tell though with this terrible picture quality we have so far. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184270-the-land-of-shadow-encounter-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1722408","commentId":1722408,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1438825531,"content":"> I like the slightly different art take on the Harad enemies.

Nightmare art is almost always just amazing though. "}]}
