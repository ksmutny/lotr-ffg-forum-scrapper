I'll find the page number in the rulebook for you.\n\n \n\nEdit: Found it. Page 9, Main Rulebook\n\nAttachment Cards: \"If the card to which an attachment is attached leaves play, the attachment card is discarded.\"\n\n \n\n2nd Edit: Just to comment on the \"one-use attachment\" phrase; It's the same as if you play an attachment on your Ally and it is defeated by a monster. The attachment isn't one use (that is, it lasts from turn to turn), but if your Ally is lost, he takes it with him. Forest snare for that matter will last turn to turn, which I've found useful to let it sit on creatures for a while if necessary."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60108-question-on-forest-snare-card/?do=findComment&comment=590813","commentId":590813,"userName":"~Rampage~","timestamp":1328565189,"content":"I really appreciate that - I looked but didn't find it.  I figured it would be discarded, but the \"attachment\" threw me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60108-question-on-forest-snare-card/?do=findComment&comment=590836","commentId":590836,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1328569438,"content":"When you mentioned a \"one-use attachment\", I immediately thought of Ancient Mathom as another example.\n\n~But really, what would it do in your play area? just hang out?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60108-question-on-forest-snare-card/?do=findComment&comment=590842","commentId":590842,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1328570370,"content":"discard pile.. /end thread"}]}
