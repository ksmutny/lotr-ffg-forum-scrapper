I think the change would be okay, and steward would be able to bring him back to the same power level. However again, a seperate Gondor themed version may be better.\n\nOr maybe this is a nicer way of showing their evolution.

I want to be able to use Rohan and Gondor Hobbits in other quests too.\n\n \n\nI also don't want new versions that are identical but in a different sphere with different traits and the same rules. I doubt very much that's the route that will be taken by the designers too.\n\nI like the idea of setup attachments, I'll give them some more thought. I agree that 1 resource is insufficient to balance them. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129705-merry-soldier-of-rohan/?do=findComment&comment=1378408","commentId":1378408,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1419336623,"content":"I just think that they will be released as an alt version heroes someday."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129705-merry-soldier-of-rohan/?do=findComment&comment=1378558","commentId":1378558,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1419344576,"content":"nor-am-i-a-stranger.png?w=497 [http://talesfromthecards.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/nor-am-i-a-stranger.png?w=497]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129705-merry-soldier-of-rohan/?do=findComment&comment=1378644","commentId":1378644,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1419349011,"content":"yGZ0bgcMyv0.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c624323/v624323009/11963/yGZ0bgcMyv0.jpg]\n\n \n\n4wvsGPGbdt0.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c624323/v624323009/1196b/4wvsGPGbdt0.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129705-merry-soldier-of-rohan/?do=findComment&comment=1379389","commentId":1379389,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1419378046,"content":"I'm not sure if I would play Pippin.
