I´ve been playing the Flight From Moria quest in a 2-player game a few times now and during game the following scenario happen: We commit characters to quest and then flip the top quest card to side 2B which turns out to be \"a wrong turn\". We´re thus instructed, as a when-revealed effect to reveal a card per player (2 players) and add it to the staging area. The very first card revealed in this way is \"new devilry\" which has the when-revealed effect that the current quest card must be shuffled into the quest deck and a new quest card must be revealed.\n\nThus technically we must remove \"a wrong turn\" before it´s full effect has been implemented since we must follow the  new when-revealed effect as soon as we can. Will this mean that since \"a wrong turn\" is no longer the active quest that the rest of it´s effect (revealing 1 additional card) would be made void or do we continue drawing cards to fulfill an old (and perhaps obsolete at that point) card instruction?\n\nPS: we opted to keep drawing cards because we didn´t want to cheat angel.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angel.gif]\n\nAny and all thoughts are welcome"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59832-when-when-revealed-effects-reveal-when-revealed-effects-which-remove-when-revealed-effect-cards/?do=findComment&comment=587868","commentId":587868,"userName":"player1041350","timestamp":1328027888,"content":" Interesting question.  I haven't played that quest yet but I would play it the same as you ie. that it says to draw 2 cards (2 players) so you have already drawn the second card when you come to read the first."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59832-when-when-revealed-effects-reveal-when-revealed-effects-which-remove-when-revealed-effect-cards/?do=findComment&comment=587878","commentId":587878,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1328028886,"content":" Yes you still revel all the cards. the when reveal effect says draw a card per player.

Thus you completely solve the effects of 1 encounter card before moving on to the next"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59832-when-when-revealed-effects-reveal-when-revealed-effects-which-remove-when-revealed-effect-cards/?do=findComment&comment=587936","commentId":587936,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1328034451,"content":"booored said:\n\n Yes you still revel all the cards. the when reveal effect says draw a card per player.
