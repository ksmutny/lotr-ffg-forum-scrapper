Whether or not you do so is up to you. It is definitely possible to beat all of the scenarios in the game using only player cards that were available as of that release. The progression series of videos limits itself to only player cards that were available and provides some great examples of winning deck-building and strategy:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6agV3Ll1nNihJiCSotL0itNwUiiXkF2t [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6agV3Ll1nNihJiCSotL0itNwUiiXkF2t]\n\n \n\nI also have a series on my blog called Beorn's Path, in which I build two decks from the core set, and slowly evolve those decks through the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle:\n\nhttp://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/ [http://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/]\n\nGood luck!"}]}
