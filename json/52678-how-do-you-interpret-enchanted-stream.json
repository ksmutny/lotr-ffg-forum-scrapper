It doesn't state - skip the drawing part of the resource phase - it states PLAYERS CANNOT DRAW CARDS (basta) :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nbilbo enables the first player to draw an ADDITIONAL card in the resource phase - but, I CANNOT DRAW cards... at all... beravor also enables a player to draw 2 cards - but I CANNOT draw cards - also with Gandalf's Search, campfire tales, Gandalf himself, etc.\n\n \n\nthere is no overriding rule - you can subsume beravor and bilbo and everything else under the rule - they cannot draw cards.\n\ndon't try to find something, that isn't there :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52678-how-do-you-interpret-enchanted-stream/?do=findComment&comment=528839","commentId":528839,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1316144502,"content":"Well, one step in the resource phase is to draw a card. Enchanted Stream says you cannot draw cards. Bilbo's text reads that the starting player draws 1 (additional) card, Enchanted Stream says that you cannot draw cards. This is a direct contradiction, at least in my view gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\nI just wanted to post it here if someone else also is thinking like me, and save him the time searching the FAQ. And perhaps there will be more complex situations with future cards, where it's not clear what has to be done, if it weren't for rule 1.14... But as we both agree on the same result, there's nothing to worry about happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"}]}
