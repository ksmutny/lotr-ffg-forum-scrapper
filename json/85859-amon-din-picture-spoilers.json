A lot of flavorful cards with useful - but very situational/deck-dependent - abilities. Great cards, yet very few would really fit well into any decks I currently run.

Sure you can play it on Boromir but Hurluin will probably be by his side. You could use songs or Aragorn with the stone and ring, but boy that's a lot of set up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85859-amon-din-picture-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=811120","commentId":811120,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1373422155,"content":"> absolutely loving the art on ithilien archer, easily my favorite art from this AP.  On the other side of things encounter deck wise, i like how brutish Ghulat looks...him holding the decapitated head is just superb\n\nYes archer looks amazing. Really love art in this game. Mych better then decipher tcg and even better the meccg. But still meccg have a cool special style"}]}
