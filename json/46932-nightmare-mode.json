Each time a scenario was won we would renew the encounter decks but otherwise continue as if advancing to a new part of a quest. After a slow start the accumulated resources, cards and allies in play far made up for a slightly advanced threat and a few wounds here and there. The threat was reduced and damage healed later on and the Journey Along the Anduin and the Escape from Dol Guldur was much easier than previous experience.\n\nWere we doing something wrong or is this how the Nightmare Mode was intended? Because it seems more like a dream compared to the usual single Anduin or Dol Guldur.\n\nOther thoughts/experience?\n\nps: the decks were Glorfindel/Beravor/Legolas and Dunhere/Aragorn/Theodred"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46932-nightmare-mode/?do=findComment&comment=470049","commentId":470049,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1305643134,"content":"Well, the threat is not supposed to be reset in nightmare mode since with your allies and resources out, you are getting sort of a \"running start\" at the more difficult scenarios.

As long as you're not supposed to remove allies and attachments from play, I believe this mode is easier than standard play.\n\nThere was an issue in the last scenario. After we randomly selected the prisoner, was he supposed to lose his previously collected resources and attachments?

Anyway, we just used 1 core set and he used Leadership and I had Spirit. We weren't intending on playing Nightmare Mode but after getting through Mirkwood pretty well, he suggested we try Nightmare Mode to see how far we could get. We got through Anduin pretty well too. But the third scenario was a pain and we made it to about 10 progress tokens on the second quest card and just killing the Nazgul before losing. We had tons of resources, but only being able to play 1 Ally card all together per round really hampered us. I had lots of money and lots of Allies in my hand but couldn't use them. It was fun and we got further than expected.\n\n \n\nDo the people that have found Nightmare Mode easy play with multiple core sets to have 3 of everything? I would think that would make it easier than just playing with 1 core set and the stock 1 sphere decks."}]}
