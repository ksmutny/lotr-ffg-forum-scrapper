That way it would be possible to play a single deck with each member of Thorin's company. Ally versions of all 4 would be best, for maximum versatility, but I'd really like to be able to put a dwarf deck together with 10 of the 13 named dwarves as allies, 3 as heroes, and the rest of the deck filled up with attachments and events."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255378-which-cards-would-you-like-to-see-in-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=2909518","commentId":2909518,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1501664138,"content":"Brok Ironfist the second? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255378-which-cards-would-you-like-to-see-in-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=2909569","commentId":2909569,"userName":"Will Anderson","timestamp":1501670030,"content":"Saruman & Radagast as my obvious choices. I love the idea of playing a two-handed White Council deck; Gandalf and Saruman on the same side would be a fun possibility. I'd be curious to see if FF opts to reinforce the Saruman/Doomed and Radagast/Creatures relationship or take them in a different direction. If hero Radagast is similar to his ally version it would be good to see some non-Eagle Creatures introdued to support that.\n\nThranduil, yes, but also Gildor. A powerful and fairly important character who certainly deserves a hero version.\n\nEchoing some other voices, more Dwarves - hero Bofur, Tactics Dain, Balin ally, etc. Rather strangely, Dwarves lack good Tactics heroes, Gimli being the only one I play with any regularity. I would also be delighted to see Dis (Thorin's sister). I think the game has done a good job of dealing with the lack of female characters in the books, with the majority of FF-created heroes being women, but might as well take what you can from the source material. While I realise Tolkien wrote that Dwarven women rarely went abroad, I think a little license is worth taking here, and perhaps could be dealt with thematically by special abilities/restrictions.\n\nLastly, more Hobbits! Heroes and allies both. I'm surprised I don't hear this requested more. It seems there's a good chance of Spirit Sam arriving in the last Saga box, but even though I welcome that (and wouldn't mind seeing Lore Frodo or Spirit Bilbo) what I would really like is new hobbit heroes. We're limited to six at the moment (five if playing the LotR campaign) and as someone who chiefly plays two-handed theme decks, that's frustrating - especially considering Fatty is pretty poor and Bilbo overcostly. Plenty of options in the lore, with various Tooks and Brandybucks, Farmer Maggot, Tom Cotton & sons, etc."}]}
