An undefended ennemy attacks and you must assign it's power in damage to a single hero.\n\nSo, in your example, your 2 heroes exhausted to quest. You have 2 ennemies engaging you. They both get a shadow card and attack. You decide if you'll defend against the first ennemy. If you do, your remaining hero exhaust, you reveal the shadow card and compare the ennemy's power to your hero's defense, taking damage on the defending hero if the ennemy's power is higher. Then, you decide whether you'll defend against the second ennemy. If all your heroes are exhausted, then you can't defend. The attack is undefended and you reveal the shadow card (they are always more devastating when the attack is undefended) and must assign that ennemy's power as damage against any of your heroes (but you can't split the damage).\n\n\nAs for shadow card, you only look at the text under the \"shadow effect\" separator bar. A card that has a \"when revealed\" effect, but no \"shadow\" effect doesn't do anything when you get it as a shadow card (example: Caught in a Web).\n\n \n\nFinally, you can add as many cards as you want to a player deck, within the rules limit. Those are: minimum 50 cards for tournament legal deck and no more than 3 copies of the same card. I think there are something like 73 different cards across all 4 spheres right now, so you could theoretically play with over 200 cards in a single deck (using 3 copies of each). Realistically, with a single core set (and even with multiple), it's hard to reach the 50 cards minimum playing single sphere. Once you start mixing spheres, it becomes easier. FFG hasn't annouced any expansion made up of player cards only for now. They are releasing expansion packs containing a mix of player and encounter cards. The first one is The Hunt for Gollum and it contains 9 new player cards (3 copies each) as well as a new hero. The rest of the pack (32 cards) is made up of a quest (3 cards) and encounter cards relating to that quest. There should be 5 more expansions in that cycle using similar builds."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49580-2-enemy-and-1-defender-do-they-all-attack/?do=findComment&comment=496142","commentId":496142,"userName":"Rashley","timestamp":1310013022,"content":"I think SICK BOY has answered your questions well, so I won't repeat things.  This game was designed for players to make decisions about what to use their Heroes and Allies for.  Questing, Defending, then Attacking all exhaust characters, so without help from Attachments and Events, you can't do everything.  I believe the odds are about 45% that Encounter cards have Shadow effects, but those Shadow effects are 90% chance of being much worse when undefended.  As new cards are added the % may change.\n\nI havn't been influenced into buying multi sets yet due to finances, but I hate the idea of wasted cards.  Because of the 'unique' rules and limits on 3 cards of the same title, extra sets can be wasteful.  Obviously things get easier if you pack your decks with the good combos, but if it gets too easy, the fun goes.  I have had as much fun in games I have lost as won.  It is all a matter of taste and these games give you the chance to make of it what you will.  Just enjoy it.  Cheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49580-2-enemy-and-1-defender-do-they-all-attack/?do=findComment&comment=496488","commentId":496488,"userName":"Kjorn2","timestamp":1310064039,"content":"thanks all every one"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49580-2-enemy-and-1-defender-do-they-all-attack/?do=findComment&comment=496971","commentId":496971,"userName":"Wh0isTh3D0ct0r","timestamp":1310144259,"content":"Simple correction, here:\n\n\"enemy\", \"enemies\".\n\nEither way, there's only one \"n\"."}]}
