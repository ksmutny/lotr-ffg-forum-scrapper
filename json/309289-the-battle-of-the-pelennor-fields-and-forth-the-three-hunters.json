Â I've been looking at running a quasi thematic campaign using that contract since most of the time it's just the heroes themselves. Â Especially the Frodo quests. Â \n\nIf I do end up going this route I'll just make sure the deck can be adjusted to include allies for the bigger battles or just run spirit and mulligan hard for Will of the West lol."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309289-the-battle-of-the-pelennor-fields-and-forth-the-three-hunters/?do=findComment&comment=3975792","commentId":3975792,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1597730674,"content":"Thatâ€™s what I did, Will of the West for the winÂ "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309289-the-battle-of-the-pelennor-fields-and-forth-the-three-hunters/?do=findComment&comment=3976351","commentId":3976351,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1597843168,"content":"But when you know that your deck doesn't have any ally, you can not dicard until an ally is discarded.

You have to discard.\n\nSimilarly, ifÂ you play a Guarded(enemy) card against an encounter deck that contains no enemies (Battle of Lake-Town), you still have to discard, even though you know you wonâ€™t find an enemy. In that situation, we have an official ruling from FFG that you would discard until you go through the entire deck, then reshuffle it and continue play (getting the Guarded card for free). This ruling prevents an infinite loop. In the 3 Hunters/PelennorÂ situation, there is no infinite loop potential, but you do still have to discard your deck.\n\nHaving said all that, this event breaks you deck in a way probably not intended when the quest was designed. So house rule it if you want.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309289-the-battle-of-the-pelennor-fields-and-forth-the-three-hunters/?do=findComment&comment=3978361","commentId":3978361,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1598268161,"content":"> On 8/20/2020 at 5:14 PM, GrandSpleen said:\n> \n> Having said all that, this event breaks you deck in a way probably not intended when the quest was designed.

Because if you play by the rules and you did not rememebr that, then you may have to rebuild your whole deck and maybe even change some heroes... and raise your starting threat? Hmmm..... Not for me!\n\nAlso, I think this is the only instance in the whole game that this can hapen, so no harm in house ruling once.Â Â ðŸ˜Š"}]}
