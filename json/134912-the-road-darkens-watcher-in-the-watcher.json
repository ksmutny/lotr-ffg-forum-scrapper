I managed it quite well I think, but I was not sure how to handle the Watcher in the Water correctly.\n\n \n\nIt's in the staging area, but considered to be engaged with each player. I have two questions regarding this:\n\n \n\n1) How many attacks does the Watcher make? I decided he would attack each player once, since is engaged to both. Is that correct?\n\n2) How many Shadow Cards does the Watcher get? I assumed one at the beginning of the combat phase that is then valid for both attacks.\n\n3) Can I attack the Watcher normally? He is considered to be engaged, but still he is in the staging area. This confused me a bit, but I assumed I get to attack him normally as he is engaged with me.\n\n \n\nWould be happy to get some clarification on these points! Thanks in advance :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nBest regards\n\n \n\nAlain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134912-the-road-darkens-watcher-in-the-watcher/?do=findComment&comment=1449199","commentId":1449199,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1423938394,"content":"1) The watcher makes one per player per normal rules for attacks.\n\n \n\n2) The watcher gets a new shadow card for each attack (ref: FAQ 1.42: \"(1.42) Additional attacks by an enemy When an enemy makes an additional attack, discard all of its previously dealt shadow cards before dealing it a new shadow card.\")\n\n \n\n3) Unless an card states otherwise, if you are engaged with an enemy you can attack it.

So, feel free to pile on the damage and rescue Frodo. \n\nHmm I just started wondering... could all players participate in the attack at the same time, even if not ranged, seeing as they are engaged with the watcher?\n\nI have previously been thinking that you could not do it like that, but just got to think about it again. Would make the quest alot easier (too easy maybe) on a big group as opposed to solo/dual.\n\nAnyone sitting on a definite answer for that?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134912-the-road-darkens-watcher-in-the-watcher/?do=findComment&comment=1450651","commentId":1450651,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1424077135,"content":"This would then also apply to Durins Bane in Shadow and Flame.
