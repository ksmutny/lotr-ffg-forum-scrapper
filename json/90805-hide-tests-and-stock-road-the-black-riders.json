And you are only allowed one travel per round. So, you would do the Hide test, and you could explore and discard Stock Road from play, but you could not travel to another location.\n\nHowever, the rules define traveling as moving the location out of the staging area.  In this scenario, that never happens.  You elect to pay the cost, and before you actually move the card, you place progress tokens as a result of Escape to Buckland's effect, and the location is explored and discarded before it has ever been moved out of the staging area.  So technically, you have paid the cost but not traveled there.  So you have not exhausted your one travel per round, and you could travel again.  \n\nProbably not intended to be played that way, but you could house rule it.  Or get an official response if you prefer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90805-hide-tests-and-stock-road-the-black-riders/?do=findComment&comment=2621257","commentId":2621257,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1486000399,"content":"I agree with your first sentiment, that you couldn't initiate a second travel attempt.\n\nBtw, are we even sure the quest's Response would trigger before the Stock Road go to the Active location spot?\n\nWhile there is an action window inside the Hide test, there is no action window after resolution. The moment we have done the Hide test successfully, we find ourselves back in the middle of resolving the Travel action, having just paid the listed cost. And while Responses can trigger without an Action window, they don't usually go off mid-resolution of some other thing (excepting cancel/replacement type responses). This leads me to suspect the Travel resolves before the Response can trigger, thus it does reach active location status.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90805-hide-tests-and-stock-road-the-black-riders/?do=findComment&comment=2622450","commentId":2622450,"userName":"DarthJalapeno","timestamp":1486063175,"content":"You are right.
