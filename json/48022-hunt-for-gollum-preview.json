The team with the best score will win 1 copy of the adventure pack - they can figure out how to divy it out. After that we'll probably play through more casual. At the end we may raffle off another pack\n\nDuring the first play through, I won't let the players see the next part of the quest until they finish each stage, to keep the surprise factor high.

We should have 3 sets available without much problem, if 3 need to be run at once :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I plan on sleeving the cards just so they stay in good shape.\nIt does say in the insert that you will need two other specific sets of encounter cards from the core set mixed in with the Gollum cards to run it.\n\nI'm not really a fan of the current scoring system, so we probably won't use it though people are welcome to score if they want (unless the majority decide they'd prefer to use it.) I suggested people bring their own decks to play since that's generally more fun, though it may have to involve some compromise if people want to play similar decks or heroes (I think its rather hard to have more than 3 people play what they want with custom built decks- the 4th is always stuck with what heroes are left.) We'll also have the basic core decks available for people who don't yet own the game or don't have a deck to play.\n\nI know FFG has said it before, but I can confirm there's 3 of each of the player deck cards (other than Bilbo, of which there is 1.)
