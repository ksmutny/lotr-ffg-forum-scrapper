Especially since some of the attachments or characters are unique anyway.\n\nI applaud your attempt of building such a deck. Seems like it has been working for you. Maybe I'll try something like this as well... But I'll probably wait until the card pool has gotten bigger... Of course: Consistency is going to be a problem. But on the other hand: Maybe it will provide us with some new challenges!
