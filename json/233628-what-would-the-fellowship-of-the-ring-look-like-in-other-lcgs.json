Feel free to answer with your own version of those or other characters, in any LCG(or better: in any format!). Since I somehow can't install Strange Eons I will just write it down.\n\n \n\nA Game of Thrones LCG\n\n \n\nFrodo Baggins\n\n5 cost\n\n \n\nIntrigue\n\nPower\n\n3 STR\n\nHobbit. Ringbearer. The Fellowsip.\n\nStealth.\n\nInterrupt:Kneel a The Fellowship character to save a character you control.\n\n \n\nFrodo is basically the Punching Ball of the bad guys, while the rest of the team has to save him. I begin with that and decide he will be more nice if he granted that option to others.\n\n \n\nSam Gamgee\n\n4 cost\n\nMilitary\n\nIntrigue\n\n \n\n3 STR\n\nHobbit. The Fellowship.\n\nInterrupt:When another character you control would be killed, stand Sam Gamgee to save it. If that character is Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee gets +2STR until the end of the phase.\n\n \n\nSam Gamgee got the first rank of my favourite book characters(shared with Tyrion Lannister) because it's just a normal guy who just wants to protect his master. The ability was pretty easy from that.\n\n \n\nPippin\n\n2 cost\n\n \n\nIntrigue\n\n \n\n2 STR\n\nHobbit. The Fellowship.\n\nStealth.\n\nReaction:After you win an unopposed challenge in which Pippin participated, draw a card.\n\n \n\nThe FOAT helped Frodo and Sam to get to Buckleberry Ferry unnoticed, so I had to do something with Stealth.\n\n \n\nMerry\n\n2 cost\n\nMilitary\n\nIntrigue\n\n \n\n2 STR\n\nHobbit. The Fellowship.\n\nStealth.\n\nChallenges action:Kneel your faction card to put Merry into play, knelt and commited to a challenge in which you are participating. You may pay 2 gold to choose a character controlled by your opponent at that challenge. If you do so, uncommit it to the challenge.\n\n \n\nThis ability is based on Merry's epic moment. 'Nough said.\n\n \n\nAragorn\n\n6 cost\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 STR\n\nDúnedain. The Fellowship.\n\nCannot have more than one Title card attached.\n\nReaction:After Aragorn enters play, search your hand, deck and discard pile for a Title attachment, and put it into play attached to him. Shuffle your deck.\n\n \n\nThorongil\n\n2 cost\n\nTitle.\n\nAragorn only.\n\nAragorn gains a Military icon, Renown and the Warrior trait.\n\n \n\nStrider\n\n2 cost\n\nTitle.\n\nAragorn only.\n\nAragorn gains an Intrigue icon, Stealth and the Ranger trait.\n\n \n\nElessar\n\n2 cost\n\nTitle.\n\nAragorn only.\n\nAragorn gains a Power Icon, Insight and the Noble trait.\n\n \n\nSince Aragorn did multiple identity changes in the story, it seemed me cool to do that.\n\n \n\nLegolas\n\n4 cost\n\nMilitary\n\n \n\nPower\n\n4 STR\n\nSilvan. Noble. Warrior. The Fellowship\n\nWhile you control at least one Dwarf character, Legolas gets +1STR. If that character is Gimli, he also gains Insight.\n\n \n\nGimli\n\n4 cost\n\nMiltary\n\n \n\nPower\n\n4 STR\n\nDwarf. Warrior. The Fellowship.\n\nWhile you control at least one Silvan character, Legolas gets +1STR. If that character is Gimli, he also gains Intimidate.\n\n \n\nLegolas and Gimli really complemented each other, sooooooooooooooooo surprise surprise they also do here!\n\n \n\nBoromir\n\n3 cost\n\nMilitary\n\n \n\nPower\n\n5 STR\n\nGondor. Noble. Warrior. The Fellowship.\n\nIntimidate. Renown.\n\nForced Reaction:After a challenge ends in which Boromir participated, put a corruption token on him. Then, discard the top card of your deck. If that card's cost is equal or lower to the number of corruption tokens he has, sacrifice him and kneel a character you control.\n\n \n\nBoromir is a powerful ally, but as longer you get how less trustworthy he becomes. You'll never know when he will hurt you bad.\n\n \n\nGandalf\n\n7 cost\n\nMilitary\n\nIntrigue\n\nPower\n\n6 STR\n\nIstari. The Fellowhsip.\n\nReaction:After you win a challenge in which Gandalf participated, reveal the top 5 cards of your deck. Choose one to add it to your hand, one to discard, one to shuffle into your deck, one to put at the top of your deck and one to put at the bottom.\n\n \n\nAnd, finally, Gandalf is a scryer to find your combo pieces."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233628-what-would-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-look-like-in-other-lcgs/?do=findComment&comment=2480498","commentId":2480498,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1477766307,"content":"Wow, you really took your time with these.\n\n \n\nWith Frodo, I'd change the text to \"Kneel other Fellowship character to save Frodo.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233628-what-would-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-look-like-in-other-lcgs/?do=findComment&comment=2480929","commentId":2480929,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1477809918,"content":"> Wow, you really took your time with these.\n> \n>  \n> \n> With Frodo, I'd change the text to \"Kneel other Fellowship character to save Frodo.\"\n\nGood point, but I wanted to make him somewhat more useful.\n\nAlso, yesterday I saw Arrow Season 4 episode 5 and there was a character named...John Constantine."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233628-what-would-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-look-like-in-other-lcgs/?do=findComment&comment=2480930","commentId":2480930,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1477810493,"content":">  \n> \n> > Wow, you really took your time with these.\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > With Frodo, I'd change the text to \"Kneel other Fellowship character to save Frodo.\"\n> \n> Good point, but I wanted to make him somewhat more useful.\n> \n> Also, yesterday I saw Arrow Season 4 episode 5 and there was a character named...John Constantine.\n\nWell, I am obviously a fan of that character :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\nYou're pretty far behind if you've seen that episode just yesterday, ain't ya?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233628-what-would-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-look-like-in-other-lcgs/?do=findComment&comment=2481200","commentId":2481200,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1477842258,"content":"Plus he's been a comicbook character for years."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233628-what-would-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-look-like-in-other-lcgs/?do=findComment&comment=2494260","commentId":2494260,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1478628252,"content":"I'm back!\n\n \n\nStar Wars LCG\n\n \n\nFrodo Baggins\n\n2 cost\n\n2 force\n\nHobbit.
