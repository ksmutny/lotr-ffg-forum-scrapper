It has really made me feel like my possibilities have opened up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62622-new-player-what-expansion-should-i-get/?do=findComment&comment=614449","commentId":614449,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1333717639,"content":"I'd have to cast a vote for \"All of them! NOW!\"\n\nOr failing that, Hunt for Gollum is a good one, as has been said already. Hills of Emyn Muil as a quest is actually pretty decent for further introductions to the game though, I think. There aren't all that many enemies being thrown out of the encounter deck for you to feel overwhelmed (leading to multiple losses, leading to embitterment and so on) though I really don't remember now where all the player cards came from to say whether it's a good pack for them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62622-new-player-what-expansion-should-i-get/?do=findComment&comment=619072","commentId":619072,"userName":"peterstepon","timestamp":1334729581,"content":"How about Conflict at the Carrock?  That was ranked as the best scenario by many players.  The adventure might seem hard, but if done correctly is quite easy and very satisfying to complete. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62622-new-player-what-expansion-should-i-get/?do=findComment&comment=619273","commentId":619273,"userName":"Drengi","timestamp":1334756123,"content":"Just take the plunge and buy the whole cycle, as others have said it really opens things up!\n\n \n\n I'm a staunch lover of buying everything in order though, so i always have to get everything as it comes out!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62622-new-player-what-expansion-should-i-get/?do=findComment&comment=619391","commentId":619391,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1334768257,"content":" I'm getting ready to sell mine. 2 core sets,  all of the Mirkwood cycle, KD, and the first two from the current cycle. "}]}
