I'll certainly be taking a look at some of those custom quests you've created.\n\nBTW, how do you recommend printing out cards?

I use glossy photo paper and print on the highest quality setting, then cut out the cards and glue the A and B sides together with general purpose non-water-based adhesive. I store all my cards in cheap card sleeves. I've tried different thicknesses of paper and have found 150-180gsm to be best.\n\nFor non-quest cards, I have printed out sheets of encounter card backs which I glue to the backs of the cards as above.\n\nHope this helps!"}]}
