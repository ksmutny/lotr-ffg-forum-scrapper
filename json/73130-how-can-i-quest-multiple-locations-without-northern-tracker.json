Yes, but then it is not highly possible each turn……..just once or maybe twice a game. There a re 41 cards and 11 locations.\n\n2. No we haven´t seen Ents yet.\n\n3. Legolas puts quest tokens on an active location first. Locations always act as a buffer. This is also somewhere in the FAQ on the FFG homepage.\n\n4. Dale Scout is an ally who lets you transfer quest tokens from one location to another. Bombur can reduce the threat of an location by one.\n\n "}]}
