This card has easily lifted such a deck to a higher level.\n\nEven in the deck alone there are so many good candidates. Gandalf is of course the best of them. And the fact you now have both Sneak Attack and this event to put him into play for a phase, increases the chances of seeing the Grey Wizard enter play significantly. All the more with the Tome of Atanatar.\n\nBut there are many others who benefit. For the questing, Denethor and Veteran of Osgiliath are great willpower boosts, especially with Visionary Leadership and threat at 40+. Then Mablung is another interesting option, one that easily joins the deck with the possibility to get him into play with Herald of Anórien and A Very Good Tale. Yet, it is perhaps best to put him into play for the questing phase, repeatedly.\n\nImagine this, you exhaust two allies for the Tale, then use Reinforcements (or Sneak) for Mablung, engage an enemy to lower threat in the staging area, and ready one of the previously exhausted allies thanks to Faramir.\n\nEnvoy of Pelargir and Squire of the Citadel work wonders with Leadership Boromir. You can play Reinforcements even on round one, and still have the attack bonus thanks to either of these giving the Leadership to the great Gondor leader.\n\nFinally, the card shines even more with a second player. It really opens so many options. Gandalf can suddenly lower threat or draw cards for the other player as well. And he can quest not exhausted with a player using Galadriel (and perform an action during the quest phase if needed).\n\nThe Silvan deck is a great partner in general. It can lend you Galadhrim Minstrel to pick another Sneak, Reinforcements, Tale or Strength of Arms, for instance.\n\nThere are many other possibilities, of course, and I am sure every avid deck-builder will enjoy finding them for themselves. I just wanted to share my enthusiasm about this great card.\n\nEdited October 13, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191143-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=1846286","commentId":1846286,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1444743110,"content":"As a huge fan of mono-leadership Gondor, I was rather underwhelmed by thia card.

But have you actually tried it?\n\nI was not sure about the card but it has completely changed how the deck runs. As I say above, to double the chance of putting Gandalf into play round 1 is invaluable. And it is now the number one card I am looking for in my set-up hand, maybe next to Steward of Gondor, depending on situation. As the round 1 is usually the most important, the impact Reinforcements have on it is just huge, much much bigger than Sneak Attack.\n\nUse Reinforcements for Envoy of Squire may seem like a waste, but it certainly is not if they are one of the two. Again, as I give the example above, especially with Envoy, it may be a huge difference to have the resource on Boromir for his attack bonus or for Visionary Leadership.\n\nAnother great combo is with A Very Good Tale. You use Reinforcements for Gandalf to get all the help out of him, and you use the other ally, like Denethor, Anborn, Ingold, or whoever from your teammate for the Tale. Yes, you need one other ally ready but that should be quite easy to achieve, especially when using Faramir.\n\nIf you haven't tried it, I recommend.\n\nEdited October 13, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191143-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=1846509","commentId":1846509,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1444750441,"content":"> Reinforcements... or refreshments?\n\nAmazing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191143-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=1846572","commentId":1846572,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1444753322,"content":"I haven't had much experience with it to be honest, just played it a few times but mostly it just sat in my hand. I think the card's efficiency could be determined by the heroes we use and the rest of the deck. What heroes do you use in the deck, apart from Boromir? Do you also run x3 Sneak Attack in addition to Reinforcements? How many copies of Reinforcements do you run in the deck?\n\n \n\nI just don't see how paying 3 to put Gandalf + another 1 cost ally for a phase is better than paying 1 for Sneak Attack Gandalf and 1 for a permanent ally. It 's just economically inefficient, unless there is some trick or special strategy behind it, which I don't see. Even in the first couple of rounds, spending 3 for an event which has a fleeting ability in a deck that needs to put permanent bodies on the table fast seems really risky to me. Normally those resources will go to pay for attachments or allies, and even if I play Galadriel I'll at least get something on the table for the next round. \n\n \n\nTo give an example of an optimal first turn, I'll first play Steward, then a 1 cost ally like Squire or Errand Rider or Envoy (which is essentially 1 cost). I'll save 1 resource for Aragorn's ability, and either save the other resource for the next round or play Sneak Attack Gandalf. Reinforcements just doesn't fit with this plan, as it is very expensive early game, doesn't really advance your board state, and most of all, it uses up valuable resources you could use to play cheaper stuff that stays in play. All in all, I see it mainly as a mid to late game \"bomb\" card like Strength of Arms, something to play in a specific and presumably combat heavy round when you want to get a temporal action and stat boost, but even then I'd just use Strength of Arms. You would say that the two events combine well, but you'd need to have them both in hand as well as 5 resources just for events.

My perception of the game/situation with the mono-Leadership deck is quite the opposite to yours, it seems. Whilst you think Sneak Attack is unreliable, I rather find the expensive allies to be so in the early game -- on most of the quests by far the most important part. There just is no way to put 4+ cost allies into play (well, I am not using Wealth of Gondor for that, and I don't think many players are). It is the Reinforcements that make that possible, or much much more probable. Sneak Attack is just three cards in a deck of 50, the math is simple here. Also, whilst I do hesitate to put the likes of Denethor into play using Sneak Attack, I have no such hesitation doing it with Reinforcements. This notion is multiplied with the cheaper allies; I only need one expensive (or off-sphere) ally to justify the cost of Reinforcements, the other can be cheaper. And really, whilst Envoy of Pelargir effectively costs 1 when you pay it normally, it gives you 1 resource when using Reinforcements -- you see the 2 cost difference, emulating your argument about cost-efficiency. One may argue you lose slots in the deck, but by raising the chances of playing Gandalf, you raise your card draw as well, so you should be better in this aspect as well. The difference is of course that with Reinforcements the allies do not stay in play, but that can be both sometimes beneficial (Imrahil) or totally necessary because in this deck you just rely on chump blockers."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191143-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=1849519","commentId":1849519,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1444912884,"content":"My deck runs Boromir, Aragorn and Balin. The allies are x3 Squire, x3 Rider, x3 Envoy, x3 Guard, x3 Herald, x2 Veteran, x2 WT Watchman, x2 Faramir, x3 Gandalf, x1 Ingold, x3 Galadriel. Basically the idea is to use Galadriel and King Under the Mountain as a replacement of card draw and get allies and attachments like Sword that was Broken in play and build a willpower and attack army.\n\n \n\nNote that about Sneak Attack I said it CAN SOMETIMES be unreliable. I never said it IS unreliable. The only problem with it is that sometimes you find yourself in the situation of having Sneak Attack in hand but no allies, as I know has happened to all of us at some point. I still think it's an extemely good card and include at least x2 of it in every deck I build with Leadership (x3 in this one). I am comparing it to Reinforcements to show that in solo that drawback, (which for Sneak Attack is very minor) is doubled (as you need 2 allies in hand to justify it) and the cost tripled, and IMO that doesn't make playing Gandalf plus a weenie for a phase worthwhile.  As I said in my initial evaluation of the card, whenever I drew Reinforcements and an ally, unless that ally was Gandalf or Faramir, I preferred to just play the ally for the same cost if not cheaper. For the bigger allies, yes, I too don't play them very early on, but then again I prefer to save my resources to play them permanently the next couple of rounds (which is not hard with Steward). \n\n \n\nI have a similar opinion as you do on a Very Good Tale. I've never played more than 2 in a game that I remember, but here's the thing. A Very Good Tale costs 0, and provided you meet the requirements (which are not very different from Reinforcements), it puts 2 allies into play permanently. Reinforcements costs 3, and at the end of the phase you're no better than you were before. At that point Reinforcements becomes a win-more card, as there are cards that do its job better. In my case at least, it was an unnecessary card.\n\n \n\nFinally, I don't see the benefit of sneaking chump blockers with Reinforcements. They're dead anyway and are not coming back, so why dedicate slots, resources and events to put a chump into play you could just as easily have played normally? \n\nEdited October 15, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191143-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=1849563","commentId":1849563,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1444914656,"content":"Besides being able to put the ally into play with any player, the one thing I see that Reinforcements does better than Sneak Attack is allowing you to put two high cost allies into play with a single card (3 card combo total).  To do the same thing with Sneak Attack, you need 4 cards total which makes it much more difficult to realize the combo.  Now, the reason this is actually somewhat important is because you can then add on A Very Good Tale.  It is certainly not outside the realm of possibilities of starting with 1x A Very Good Tale, 1x Reinforcements, and 2x high cost ally.  This allows you to start the game with 2 strong allies if you hit with your A Very Good Tale for 3 resources, which is certainly worthwhile.  In a multiplayer game, you need not have ANY high cost allies because your partners could give you the allies.  There are definitely some strengths Reinforcements has that Sneak Attack does not. \n\n \n\nWith all that said, in general, I would think it would be hard to make a deck around this card unless your friends constructed decks to work specifically with it.\n\nEdited October 15, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191143-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=1851600","commentId":1851600,"userName":"opethwindowpane","timestamp":1445014772,"content":"Here is the deck I've used several times.  It has worked very well, even when the other played only Ent allies.\n\n \n\nHeroes(3):\n\nHalbarad (leadership)\n\nSam Gamgee (leadership)\n\nAragorn (tactics)\n\n \n\nAllies(25):\n\nFaramir\n\nGimli\n\nLegolas\n\nGwaihir\n\nBoromir\n\nBeorn\n\nDunedain Watcher\n\nSon of Arnor\n\n2x Bill the Pony\n\n3x Descendant of Thorondor\n\n3x Dunedain Hunter\n\n3x Weather Hills Watchman\n\n3x Ranger of Cardolan\n\n3x Gandalf (core)\n\n \n\nAttachments(4):\n\n3x Sword that was Broken\n\n1x Hobbit Cloak\n\n \n\nEvents(18):\n\n3x Sneak Attack\n\n3x Reinforcements\n\n3x Descendants of Kings\n\n3x Dunedain Message\n\n3x Ranger Summons\n\n3x Grim Resolve\n\n \n\nSide Quests(3):\n\nDelay the Enemy\n\nSend for Aid\n\nGather Information"}]}
