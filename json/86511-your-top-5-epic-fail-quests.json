He hadn't beaten it yet and wanted to really badly. So, I played with a Mono-Leadership Outlands deck to ensure an easy victory. By the end of the game I was committing 39 Willpower to the quest, so we were obviously doing well. However, we got the 'burning Minas Tirith' Plot card and Telemnar's Bane which combo to reduce your deck towards a loss if it gets depleted. We're getting up to 5 discards per turn and we draw the False Lead card which stops us from an easy victory. My deck is getting down there (I started with exactly 50 cards since I didn't have good card draw) and I foolishly play A Very Good Tale and end up depleting 5 cards from my deck. My friend calls me on it and points out that I only have 6 cards left in my deck.

We go from awesome challenging quests that make me sit for hours in the deck builder trying, tweaking and getting crushed then slowly finding paths and ideas that unlock wins to auto winning on my first time with no deck adjustments.

Hobbit 2 was much better but as they were designed together suffers much of the same unforgivable choices. I do like the idea of these packs though and expect the next one to be better.

If I beat another kid in a two player game and taunted him mercilessly, with explicit references to his mother's sex life and my role in it, the way some online gamers do today, he would have justifiably kicked the everliving **** out of me. So I learned – in arcades – the importance of good sportsmanship. Because arcades were real places, staffed by real people, we had to worry about much more than getting kicked off a server if we were complete idiots in a game. I guess this is a double-edged sword, and I’m feeling like a cranky old man by even mentioning it, but would you all do me a favor?

Road to Rivendell.  This quest had some promise, but having a quest with basically two cards that end the game unless you have a Cancel card is pretty lame.\n\n \n\n3. Redhorn Gate/Dead Marshes.  These two quests are fine as long as the cards you NEED aren't discarded/come up as Shadows.  They scream for erratas like the Troll key/Purse got, meaning if they are discarded, add them to the staging area.\n\n \n\n2.  Steward's Fear.  I like a lot of the ideas in this quest, just don't feel the urge to play it, mostly because it can be so slow, especially solo if locations aren't coming as much as you'd like.  Can have 3 turns or more with no progress on the quest.  Love the boss fight and underground though, so maybe I am being harsh.\n\n \n\n1.

I think the general idea is interesting, but it just doesn't scale well, so playing this solo puts you at a far greater disadvantage than playing with two or more players. After I'd hammered away at this to finally get a couple of solo wins, I put it back in its box and don't ever really play it.\n\n \n\nReturn to Mirkwood. Again, as a solo player, this hits you way too fast. I think this would have worked better if some of the effects, like how much threat you gain, had been in some way based on the number of players in the game.\n\n \n\nJourney to Rhosgobel. I just don't enjoy this quest. Any quest that heavily influences how you need to build your deck to stand a chance just isn't fun, as it limits the strategies you can employ.\n\n \n\nDungeons Deep and Caverns Dim. Similar to the above, the riddles mean you need to build your deck in a certain way...and also in solo you wind up milling through your deck really quickly, so you either deck yourself or need to play spirit and will of the west.\n\n \n\nAnd to be honest i struggle to think of a fifth I don't like. I'm not a great fan of the mirkwood cycle, as I just feel like they were finding their feet. I loved Khazadum, and the whole Dwarrodelf cycle. I enjoy Heirs (though I look forward to trying it once we have all the player cards from the cycle), and so far the new cycle is entertaining. I like the theme of the hobbit boxes.\n\nI suppose the only one that consistently gives me great trouble is laketown. But I don't dislike it, I just find it challenging.\n\n \n\nGenerally though, every since Khazadum, I think the design of the quests is just going from strength to strength, and I love how thematic they are becoming - battlegrounds removing quest stages in seige of cair andros, for example. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86511-your-top-5-epic-fail-quests/?do=findComment&comment=817358","commentId":817358,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1374213715,"content":"I'm changing my list:\n\n \n\n1) The Hills of Emyn Muil: simply a snooze-fest.

If you have a threat reduction and if you didn get the enemies in the begin it realy easy. Yes is playable solo for sure. But this quest is really unbalaced.

I had a dozen games or so in which I did all I could do to defeat the spider beast, but only managed to do so once, as my threat ran out in all of the other games. It's annoying to have such a challenging enemy but not being able to fight it.\n> \n>  \n> \n> My main problem with RtM is that the designer could have easily avoided the threat problem by adding an additional rule for solo players. \"At the end of the turn the starting player raises his threat by X, where X is the number of players.\" RtM could have been such a great quest, but with its designer flaw it lost lot of its potential. That's why I call it a fail  -not because the quest is that bad.\n> \n>  \n\nThe only threat reduction I ever used when I was using a Leadership Lore deck (Without Loragorn) was 1 gandalf, and like I said I beat the quest 5/6 times.  I'm glad that the rule is to raise your threat by 4 since it would be too easy otherwise.  Makes you have to rush to thruanduil's palace as fast as you can, cuz if you stall, big bad enemies will get you.  If you didn't have the huge threat raising for solo, you could just take your time defeating enemies and walk your way to the palace with  your huge group of allies.  I think RtM is a very good quest solo and multiplayer.  It's much different solo, like how all the Mirkwood cycle quests were very different from each other.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86511-your-top-5-epic-fail-quests/?do=findComment&comment=819235","commentId":819235,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1374517434,"content":"> > 5) The Steward's Fear: The Hills of Emyn Muil 2.0 (slightly better, but for me, not by much. theme isn't enough to promote it off the list).\n> \n> Ahem, you can't be serious about comparing SF to HoEM!

That what make some quests easy and some more difficult. For example Thorin companu deck can be good almost against all quests. But siege of Cair adros is really difficult for this deck. Even if i win i never ever can expolre battleground locations so i hane a long way. SF is quite easy for TH Company unless you didn get a certain plot....... My Elrond deck can explore BG locations in SOCA and much more easy win this quest but SF is almost impossible to win.......\n\nI love SF is quite cool . Plot cards is really cool!\n\n \n\nDruadan and Amon looks easy solo so im not so happy with that.\n\nBUt sometink tell me last 3 quest should be hard. Last one for sure about 8. Osgiliath looks very promising maybe 7.

The key may be that I really favour archery heavy decks, and those can make it so much easier to cope early on etc with the enemies.
