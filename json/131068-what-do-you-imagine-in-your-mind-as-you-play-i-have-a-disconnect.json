This may even be weird, but I imagine in my mind's eye what is going on as I play the game.\n\n \n\nFor example, the heroes commit to a quest. The encounter deck flips a card. It's a Forest Spider. To me, our heroes happened to be on their journey (through Mirkwood or whatever), and the Forest spider spots them and stalks them until it is time to encounter (whether willingly - i.e., my threat is above his - and he attacks, or I willingly engage). Let's say I then 'travel' to this location. Let's also say the spider engages.\n\n \n\nSo when the spider is 'engaged' with me, I imagine a continues battle going on. This is where my disconnect happens.\n\n \n\nI have heroes and allies that commit to a quest, leaving those who are not committed to the quest to battle the spider.\n\n \n\nSo... what is this an abstract of? In the middle of a fight, a few characters run off to go search a location? They then come back for a turn, maybe take a blow from the spider, then take off again next turn to go on a quest? The timing here is messed up in my mind. Either the fight with the spider is taking weeks and is an engagement that is off and on constantly as they are stalked by the spider on their adventure, or my heroes and allies are The Flash.\n\n \n\n\"Okay, guys... I'll be right back... gotta quest...\" and they zoom off in a cloud of dust and then suddenly reappear, panting.\n\n \n\nWhat do you guys imagine? Can you help me change the way I think about it?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131068-what-do-you-imagine-in-your-mind-as-you-play-i-have-a-disconnect/?do=findComment&comment=1395466","commentId":1395466,"userName":"Robin Graves","timestamp":1420595899,"content":">  \n> \n> What do you guys imagine?\n\n \n\nArwen and Galadriel.... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\nAhem, Ok, ok back to the spider. Yeah does seem a bit odd. I always imagined them splitting in a rear guard and the others going ahead while the rear guard fought the spider. Wich is either doing hit and run attacks or actually abunch of spiders, or stalking them...\n\n \n\nYeah i dunno a good way to explain it either.\n\n \n\nSee? This is why i play netrunner. (But in that game i get confused in that the hackers get to make make more credits (money) than the mega corporations!)\n\nEdited January 7, 2015 by Robin Graves"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131068-what-do-you-imagine-in-your-mind-as-you-play-i-have-a-disconnect/?do=findComment&comment=1396219","commentId":1396219,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1420641634,"content":"I just see numbers and effects for the most part.

Staying \"thematic\" is largely up to the player, and the decks he/she creates. Eagles in quests like \"The Long Dark\" is a bit odd, but perfectly legal, as far as rules go.

Like while you can thematically explain **** like northern tracker exploring the traveled locations ahead of you through the mechanisms of the game it is a little harder to explain say Westroad Traveler instantly teleporting an entire party to any location.\n\n \n\nThese things and the eagle thing are thematic inconsistencies with the game itself, though the mechanisms. Still there is another type of theme that games can be about and that is in the \"story\" it creates. This game is much more in that vien, I liken it to a series of bullet points. So the game is abstract and then forms a series of events that you can use as a skeleton to make a story, though itself dose NOT make a story. Much imagination is needed.\n\n \n\nA big often cited problem with this idea is the time period, we have unique and heroes from all over the time period of middle earth how can all be in the same group or how arbitrary the traveled location is and how it dosn't in anyway represent the parties location in a thematic sense, only a abstract one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131068-what-do-you-imagine-in-your-mind-as-you-play-i-have-a-disconnect/?do=findComment&comment=1397470","commentId":1397470,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1420721757,"content":"Some people just lack a colorful imagination.

One of the ents was killed defending Frodo from the spider.\n\nOr something along those lines.
