Now that there is catagories, I am hoping this will be a little better received, as the more important stuff has its own place now, and the general area has a bit more freedom.\n\nSo, let me introduce you to Tolkienology- a series that takes a look at the many fascinating people and places that we have encountered in the game so far. I don’t claim to be a Tolkien expert, however I have had a rather unhealthy obsession with Middle Earth since I was around 11, so hopefully I can make this interesting and informative to those who have little or a casual knowledge in Middle Earth, and still an entertaining read to those who are better versed in Tolkien lore. Its also a chance for me to brush up on characters/events i dont have as much knowledge as id like on.\n\nThe first chapter takes a look at whats currently flying round the forum discussions- Elladan and Elrohir.\n\n \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nElladan and Elrohir are the identical twin brothers (though it is never said they were twins outright, it is heavily suggested given Elf reproductive cycles cannot allow for 2 non-twin births in the same year) and sons of Elrond of Rivendell and Celebrian of Lothlorien (who was Celeborn and Galadriel's daughter). They are also therefore Arwen's siblings as well, and seeing as Elrond fostered Aragorn, then he can be seen as a sort of non-blood relative. They were born in the year 130 of the Third Age (though i have seen it as 130 and 139 in various encyclopedias, but the appendices in the book tops), and it is indicated that they were inseparable. Elladan means Elf-Man, or as Tolkien states in his letters, more specifiacally Elf-Numenorean, showing his dual decent, and Elrohir means Elf-Knight, though rohir’s literal translation is horse-lord (rohirrim for istance), though Tolkien specifically stated that it meant the former.\n\nDespite being elves of high birth, the brothers both sought a life more akin to that of the Dunedain- the Rangers of the North, often helping them in protecting the remnants of Arnor in the north. This was in no small part due to the fact that their mother, Celebrian, was ambushed by orcs in the year 2509, whilst crossing the High Pass of the Misty Mountains (the same pass that Thorin and co. are attacked in in The Hobbit). She was wounded with a poisoned arrow, and despite her rescue, she departed Middle Earth to the Undying Lands. From then on the brothers kept a special grudge against orcs, and hunted them wherever they could find them.\n\nDuring The War of the Ring and the events of the trilogy, the brothers aid Aragorn alongside the other members of the Grey Company- a small group of rangers who travel towards rohan and accompany Aragorn through the Paths of the Dead and onto the epic battle of The Pelennor Fields, and then presumably onto the battle before the Morannon (the battle before the black gate).\n\nAfter the fall of Sauron and the departing of their father from the Grey Havens, they are said to remain in Rivendell for some time, as they, like their sister Arwen, were given the choice to remain in Middle Earth or depart to the Undying Lands. It is never said by Tolkien that they chose either way, but given the delay, many think they chose the life of mortal men, though either way, it can be said with certainty, that they both chose the same fate.\n\n \n\nWell that's it for chapter 1...a little short seeing as they arent really central characters, but i couldnt resist the obvious choice given the hype around their synergy. So, post if you have any input, or if ive made any mistakes.\n\n \n\npeace\n\nRich\n\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60780-tolkienologychapter-1-elladan-and-elrohir/?do=findComment&comment=597093","commentId":597093,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1329838833,"content":"This is marvellous!

Being a Tolkien fan, like yourself, its frustrating knowing that there are a million more questions to be answered! Have you seen the 'Hunt For Gollum' on You tube? Theyve given it a good go and done it for the enjoyment of fans.

I'm not convinced that it is logical that they would have the choice at all (I know - I think - that Tolkien indicated that they did in a letter, but then of course Tolkien was himself in a continuous process of rethinking and rewriting all kinds of points, and as a result there are many gaps and inconsistencies within a lot of this \"background\" material).\n\nAs I see it, there are actually two separate choices:\n\n1. The Choice of Luthien - the option that always appears to have been open to Elven women to marry mortal Men and thereby sacrifice their own immortality, this choice being made in the First Age by Luthien (obviously) and others.\n\n2. The Choice given to Elrond and his brother Elros at the end of the First Age, this choice being given by virtue of their unusual mixed lineage. Elros of course chose mortality and founded Numenor, Elrond chose Elf-hood and immortality.\n\nAs I see it, choice (2) committed not just Elrond and Elros but also all their descendants to the original decision. This is certainly the case for Elros - his descendants, the Kings of Numenor, did not themselves get the chance to opt for immortality, and indeed later came to bitterly resent this decision, resulting in the downfall of Numenor.\n\nTherefore, by this logic, Elrond's decision would have committed all his children to Elf-hood. Arwen, in TLOTR, is separately able to make the choice of Luthien like some of her forebears, but Elrohir and Elladan would not have this option.\n\nLeaving this aside, it is a fascinating speculation as to what choice they would have made. It's pretty clear from their role in TLOTR that they aligned themselves closely with Aragorn and the Dunedain, and I think it's clear that in the undetailed backstory they have spent much time riding the wild with the Rangers, slaying Orcs and so on. All this points in the direction of the choice of mortality. You could even imagine the scenario where one twin chooses to stay and the other to depart.\n\nAnyway, I've really enjoyed running Elrohir and Elladan in the game - it's great that these characters who are minor in terms of their role in the book, but are clearly among the mightiest and most nobly descended of all the peoples of Middle-earth, get their chance in the sun.\n\nThanks again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60780-tolkienologychapter-1-elladan-and-elrohir/?do=findComment&comment=637697","commentId":637697,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1338354815,"content":"thanks for stopping by jjeagle, those are certainly some interesting points you make, and i agree - im pleased theyve recieved some spotlight due to this game\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60780-tolkienologychapter-1-elladan-and-elrohir/?do=findComment&comment=650621","commentId":650621,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1340810112,"content":"jjeagle said:\n\nAs I see it, there are actually two separate choices:\n\n1.
