Maybe his threat level lower to 10.\n\n2 Baravur : Target player draw 2 cards. Limited once per turn.\n\n3 Northern Tracker: After Northern tracker commits to the quest chose a location, put 1 progress token on this location.His attack, life and defense level also to strong i think. Maybe he should to be unique????\n\n4 Theres is no limit how many cards you can draw per turn but in he end of the turn every player must discard card until he have 6 cards in his hand.\n\nIf you use this errata game is more balanced and become more interesting. Other wise 50 cards expert decks destroy all this core quests easy (mostly in coop games) But even i solo games This 4 cards from above also too powerful.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49641-some-cards-errata/?do=findComment&comment=496581","commentId":496581,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1310087506,"content":"You're telling my that Solo play on Quest 3 is too easy for you?

I kinda doubt that.\n\n\n\nI dont talk about some quest i talk about balance of the game. And of course third quest is just impossible to play solo. Maybe in the future with some new cards.... maybe.  But with 2 players is most difficult from all 3 quest but still to easy for 50 card expert  decks.\n\nLet me explain this.  You have Beravur, Gimly, Eowyn, Aragorn, Legolas, Denetor. After 6-8 rounds with steward of gondor, U courage, Northern tracker, sneak attack, and lot of Gandalf in your hand you win. You also have test of the will and hasty stroke. And if you really need something Beravur allow you to draw 5 cards per turn with U courage or 7 cards if you have 2 on him. So tell me what encounter deck can do???? He reveal 2 ok maybe with surge 3 cards per round and you draw together 2 players about 8. And there is no discard i the end of the turn. So you have half of your deck i your hand on the 12 or 15 turn and lot of resources with SOG there is any problem for you?????? From this moment its only question of time. There is Gimly with 2 armor can kill any enemies.\n\nYes you say there is some encounter cards who can discard armor and add threat and other bad thing but with crazy draw From Beravur i keep in my hand Hasty stroke, Test of will and gandalf wtih sneak attack. There is no chance for encounter deck. Not even small chance. NO ANY CHANCE!!!!We can play gandalf every turn with sneak, Gandalf him self and stand and fight. And second player have more 3 gandalf.\n\nAnd northern tracker even only one solve all the problem with locations. Bingo.\n\nThis 4 cards to powerful. Need to do something.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49641-some-cards-errata/?do=findComment&comment=496654","commentId":496654,"userName":"Iver2","timestamp":1310104092,"content":"all of your tactics Glaurung are based only on the fact that you take 2-3 core sets and combine very powerful cards which lost just 1 or 2 into one \"professional\" deck and here we go.

If this will make the future quests and encounter decks more powerful will be ok. Actually that what all of us want.\n\nAnd i really hope for that.  But i talk to people who play HFG and some of them say is more easy than Anduin core quest. This make worried.\n\nDont get me wrong. I like the game i really deep inside the game. And i want the game expand and grow. But now the game not challenge for me anymore. And with another Heroes you cannot win at all. So we have couples of heroes who is to powerful and you win for sure. And all other (solo game) is to weak to look on them serious. I mean in tournaments perspective.Lets really hope is only begining and everything will change.\n\nAbout idea :you can always make the house rules and play how you want. This not interesting. I prepare my self for tournaments and i dont want t have another play expirience other than official rules.\n\nAbout Thalin why not i think he is really good, more players you have more better he is.But there is the problem still with more players game start to be walk in the park anyway.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49641-some-cards-errata/?do=findComment&comment=496849","commentId":496849,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1310129400,"content":"I agree about Beravor's abilitie.It is ridiculous wen in the half of the game you have 35 cards in your hand.Just imagine a tournament game:wait a minute mate somewhere in my hand  i think i have a hasty stroke.It will not take long i have only 35 cards in my hand i am sure i have one......"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49641-some-cards-errata/?do=findComment&comment=496905","commentId":496905,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1310135375,"content":"servant of the secret fire said:\n\nI agree about Beravor's abilitie.It is ridiculous wen in the half of the game you have 35 cards in your hand.Just imagine a tournament game:wait a minute mate somewhere in my hand  i think i have a hasty stroke.It will not take long i have only 35 cards in my hand i am sure i have one......\n\n\n\nYes Servant  you pointed very well.

The encounter deck should grow as well with the process of the game. But if you look on the Hunt for Gollum card there is effect x. So it make the game more hard for coop game. Bun defenitly you need a staging process as well. I mean on the first stage reveal 1 encounter card for player. On the second 1 encounter card for player +1 and third one encounter card for player +2. Something like this. For now if you build up 50 cards expert deck and play coop game is to easy. So we should to wait after 3-4 adventures pack and we will see where we are going.\n\nI see the HFG cards and i like it. I see right things in my opinion to make balance of the game better"}]}
