So I have been figuring that is null and void in 1 player games as there is no next player. correct?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97673-next-player-attacks-in-1-player-games/?do=findComment&comment=963070","commentId":963070,"userName":"Demoncow","timestamp":1390532150,"content":"Correct"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97673-next-player-attacks-in-1-player-games/?do=findComment&comment=963204","commentId":963204,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1390547348,"content":"The \"next\" player is you"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97673-next-player-attacks-in-1-player-games/?do=findComment&comment=963217","commentId":963217,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1390548341,"content":"> The \"next\" player is you\n\n \n\nNo, this was defined in the rules for The Long Dark:\n\n\"The next player is the player sitting directly to the left of \nthe player referenced by the card effect.
