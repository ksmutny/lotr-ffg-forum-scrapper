You can give him a Dwarrowdelf Axe or 2 and send him to the player that needs a little extra combat damage. You can also pass him to a dwarf player in planning that needs a 5th dwarf to get the bonus on ally Dwalin or Gloin. Nothing super amazing, but he is flexible and his stats get pretty good for the cost when Dain is in play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219748-vanish-from-sight-o-elbereth-gilthonial/?do=findComment&comment=2295825","commentId":2295825,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1467723047,"content":"Wandering took combs very well, now, with Sam ally"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219748-vanish-from-sight-o-elbereth-gilthonial/?do=findComment&comment=2296053","commentId":2296053,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1467730661,"content":"I've found myself tossing Wandering Took into some of my Hobbit decks lately to use with Elevenses.\n\nEdited July 5, 2016 by Authraw"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219748-vanish-from-sight-o-elbereth-gilthonial/?do=findComment&comment=2296443","commentId":2296443,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1467741688,"content":"Also, 2 HP for 2 Spirit resources isn't *that* common (though Angmar Awakened/Grey Havens upped the total # by 3)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219748-vanish-from-sight-o-elbereth-gilthonial/?do=findComment&comment=2379888","commentId":2379888,"userName":"Benoit Poulin","timestamp":1471921137,"content":"... this might not be good for my reputation, but does took / song / vanish / lore  aragorn combo works?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219748-vanish-from-sight-o-elbereth-gilthonial/?do=findComment&comment=2380240","commentId":2380240,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1471952259,"content":"> ... this might not be good for my reputation, but does took / song / vanish / lore  aragorn combo works?\n\n \n\nYes, it works, but the developers have clarified that your starting threat must be a value less than 20 for it to work.  This is because you cannot \"reduce\" to your starting threat if your starting threat is >20 and you are currently treating your threat as 20 (due to Vanish from Sight).  The reason O Elbereth!
