Then after I have Mithril Shirt attached to my hero, play Bartering, to return Mithril Shirt to my hand, and then immediately play it again for free, sending more enemies (and treacheries) to the discard pile.\n\nSo, does this work!?\n\nObviously there is some luck involved (though I can scry the encounter deck, to an extent, to make it less of a gamble). Also, I can probably use Asfaloth to deal with the extra location, so that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nPotentially, I can clear whole swathes of enemies from the encounter deck, if this combo is legit!\n\n \n\n> Quote\n> \n> Mithril Shirt\n> \n> Guarded (location).\n> \n> Attach to a hero.\n> \n> Response: When attached hero is dealt any amount of damage, reduce that damage by 1.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Bartering\n> Planning Action: Choose a ready player attachment on a character you control.

I don't think I'm likely to get through the entire deck, as I will be sprinting through the quest as quickly as possible (Return to Mirkwood, and I'll be playing two-handed with my Silvan deck, to spread the threat increases around).\n\nAlso, Asfaloth (attached to Spirit Glofindel) should help wipe out the extra location quickly (and the majority of the locations have 3 or fewer progress in the scenario), and willpower isn't too much of a problem with my deck. (With an ideal starting hand I can be questing for 7 on my first turn with only two heroes and no allies, and no one exhausted!*)\n\nI have plenty more ways to deal with location lock if need be, but I don't think I'll need them. (I'm not playing progression, and I have most of the cardpool.)\n\n(*ETA: that's with just the secrecy deck. The Silvan deck I've just added to assist me, as Return to Mirkwood is difficult solo and forces me out of secrecy by turn 2!)\n\n \n\nEdited October 26 by steve83"}]}
