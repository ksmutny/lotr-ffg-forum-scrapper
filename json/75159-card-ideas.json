Noble.\n\nFor each point of excess damage dealt by Eomer to an enemy put 1 progress token on the current location.\n\n * I like this guy's effect. Why a cost of 12 for a stat sum of 11? You may think of giving him -1 attack and -2 cost, and allow him to put progress tokens on quests.\n\nFirefoot\n\nTactics    2  Attachment    Mount.    \n\nAttach Firefoot to Eomer. Eomer gains the Trample keyword. (trample means any excess damage for one enemy can be put on another enemy)\n\n * Good idea. you may want to make this attachment cost 0, being unique and character specific.\n\nHelmings\n\n * I find them overpowered for their cost. Specially Erkenbrand (stats are too good with that effect, see Faramir for reference), who doesn't need to become a Hero.\n\nGrimbold of Grimslade\n\nSpirit    4    2    2    1    3    Ally    Rohan.\n\nExhaust and discard Grimbold to stop a Hero from leaving play.\n\n * Same as Erkenbrand. 4 2 1 1 2 is more OK.\n\nBanner of the Helmingas*\n\nTactics    2 Attachment    Item. Banner.    \n\nAttach to any Rohan character. Exhaust Banner of the Helmingas to choose and ready 1 Helming character.\n\n * I feel this should be Leadership.\n\nWestfold Crofter    \n\nSpirit    2    1    1    1    2    Ally    Rohan. Helming.    \n\nExhaust and put 1 damage token on Westfold Crofter to prevent an enemy from attacking this phase.\n\n * What about becoming him Lore?\n\nWestfold Scout    \n\nTactics    2    2    1    1    1    Ally    Rohan. Helming.    \n\nWhen Westfold Scout is committed to a quest, choose 1 enemy revealed from the encounter deck. If that enemy attacks this round, the defending character gets +2def.\n\n * The effect targets enemies in the staging area right? Should be a Response too. -1 willpower.\n\nEsquire of Rohan    \n\nTactics    2    1    1    1    1    Ally    Rohan.    \n\nExhaust Esquire of Rohan to give any Rohan hero +3 def.        \n\nShould this be an attachment?                                                      \n\n * +2 def. I think he's good as ally.\n\n \n\nOther cards seem fine to me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75159-card-ideas/?do=findComment&comment=730860","commentId":730860,"userName":"AjiTae","timestamp":1354778402,"content":"Éomer* : I agree with karagh but i'd take one of his HP off (instead of ATK which is essential for his ability) and then reduce its cost to 11. And indeed, his power should apply to quests too, it's an 12 (or 11) threat cost hero after all, he has to be powerful.\nBanner of Eorl* : I like it\nFirefoot* : a cost of 1 would be better suited\nSnowmane* : I think it should only do +3WP and 1HP for Theoden, 4 is too much.\nErkenbrand* : with that kind of power it should cost at least 5 or 6, you need to tweak it, not sure how\nWestfold Rider : I like it\nHornburg Defender : should cost 3\nWestfold Croft : should cost 2\nMail of Edoras : should be Restricted\nGrimbold of Grimslade* : pretty good but with Sneak Attack, the abuse is around the corner, you need to prevent that\nSpirit of the Hammerhand : OK\nBanner of the Helmingas* : I agree with karagh, should be Leadership\nWestfold Crofter : Interesting card, but I think it should cost 3\nWestfold Scout : I agree with karagh\nEsquire of Rohan : I'll go further than karagh and say +1 but I'd add another option so the card would read as\n\n\"Action : Exhaust Esquire of Rohan to give any Rohan hero +1DEF    \nAction : Exhaust and discard Esquire of Rohan to give any Rohan hero +3DEF\"\n\nMeriadoc Brandybuck* : I think it'd be more balanced if you make him cost 8 instead of 11, and make his ability function with any character, not just Rohan. Oh and I'd remove his Rohan trait so that as a counterpart he can't be buffed by Rohan effects.\nHorn of Scatha* : cost reduction in the hands of Merry should be just 1, it's powerful enough\nStybba* : I like it\nGuthlaf* : I like it too\nRider's Banner : Good but i'd make it unique, it's really a strong item\nJavelin of the Mark : I like that it's not Restricted but I'd add a limit to 1 per character\nGuthwine* : OK\nRider's Spear : OK\nCeorl* : not finished ?\n\nWhere is Theoden ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75159-card-ideas/?do=findComment&comment=731441","commentId":731441,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1354913070,"content":"Thanks for the feedback, guys!
