Do you think we might see it today? That would of course be most welcome.\n\nHowever, if we don't (and that unfortunatelly seems more likely), what do you think it can be? Is there anyone for the game? I know this is a wee bit childish but I haven't posted a guessing game thread for a while… anyone?\n\nI myself think it is Leadership, the stats are exactly as the Tactics version but I have no idea what the ability may be; but perhaps something to do with stat bonuses depending on income?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73819-new-boromir-version/?do=findComment&comment=719202","commentId":719202,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1352121712,"content":"I don't really feel a need for a new Boromir, as the current version does the job pretty well. I suppose if he is on the cards (ha!), then of the three spheres Leadership would probably be the most appropriate of the them. Wasn't he something like Warden of Gondor or something? A leader of men, at any rate. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73819-new-boromir-version/?do=findComment&comment=719218","commentId":719218,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1352124193,"content":"I have seen it reported here by a source I trust. Whilst I agree the Tactics Boromir is a great design, it seems rather weird not to get a Boromir or Denethor (or Faramir) hero in a Gondor cycle even though we had seen them before. I would personally rather see two versions of Boromir than a made up character, although I am perfectly fine with those as well since Tolkien just didn't give enough names, not enough for the game anyways, he might have given more than enough names for a typical novel reader.\n\nAnd if we indeed get Boromir, Leadership seems most fit. Boromir was heir of Denethor and about to become Steward of Gondor. High Warden of the White Tower was his title I believe."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73819-new-boromir-version/?do=findComment&comment=719239","commentId":719239,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1352126221,"content":"I've seen it reported also.

I don't think we'll see another Imrahil hero here. Someone has suggested him with the Outlands trait, at first I had thought that too but now I think probably not, I believe they make the so-called lesser man like Forlong being Outlands. We might see some of those that entered Minas Tirith at the end of the same-titled chapter of the Return of the King being designed into heroes or allies. I would guess 4 to 6 of the 8 heroes from HoN and AtS being Gondor (including Outlands), the rest Dúnedain or Rohan, maybe a single Silvan to boost up that trait a bit, no?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73819-new-boromir-version/?do=findComment&comment=719290","commentId":719290,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1352134372,"content":"I think I would prefer the second HoN hero to be Faramir - I don't dislike the idea of multiple versions of heroes, I'd just prefer a wider variety of heroes to begin with! It makes no sense for Boromir to be Lore or Spirit though, given how those spheres have established themselves now, so I agree Leadership is the best bet. I would like to venture that a hero Faramir will be Spirit though, but I suppose that will remain to be seen.\n\nI think the heroes for the subsequent cycle, though, are fair game for anything really. Dwarrowdelf cycle kicked off with two Elves and then a Dunedain Ranger, after all - hardly the dwarfy theme expected with a name like Dwarrowdelf! So I suppose anything could come from the heroes of AtS. I'd like to see some Rohan heroes, and more Silvan too. \n\nA remake of Denethor - I'm not so sure on this. His ability etc is really just quite perfect as it is, other than a Leadership version perhaps, that allows him to boost the defense of any Gondor ally that is defending against a Southron or something, I'm not so sure we need another one. Certainly not like we needed another Glorfindel! \n\nSo, out of interest, where has it been said that Boromir will be the second hero in HoN?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73819-new-boromir-version/?do=findComment&comment=719298","commentId":719298,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1352135812,"content":"spalanzani said:\n\nSo, out of interest, where has it been said that Boromir will be the second hero in HoN?\n\n\n\nThis was circulating on the French language boards at edge entertainment (the guy said it was in an article about the expansion in a gaming magazine over there).

I think it is highly reasonable, more so taking in account that the original Glorfindel has been viewed as a miss by a majority (?) of the players, and probably by designers too. So it is a dublicate in every 15 heroes, this ratio will probably change as the game progresses but even if we get a duplicate in every 10 heroes, things will be kept rather fresh.
