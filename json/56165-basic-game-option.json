It's a lot closer to how the game was designed to be played."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56165-basic-game-option/?do=findComment&comment=554946","commentId":554946,"userName":"MKraus","timestamp":1321018369,"content":"hmm interesting.

One the one hand that makes it slightly easier than a two-player game because you can coordinate your efforts better. On the other hand you have to keep track of everything on your own and don't get any helpful input from a second player. A side benefit is that it helps you in testing the decks you build for multiplayer games, so you can use them unchanged if a player joins you. It's great to find out what works well together."}]}
