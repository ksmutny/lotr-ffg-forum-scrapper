I am exaggerating, but still; there are a good bunch of great players and another of people who know a lot of Tolkien's work.\n\nWhat do you guys think about it's 'pawaR' and flavor?\n\n \n\nVisions of the Palantír [http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/13/visionsofthepalantir.jpg/] [http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/13/visionsofthepalantir.jpg/]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59495-custom-event-visions-of-the-palant%C3%ADr/?do=findComment&comment=584412","commentId":584412,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1327448306,"content":"Oh crap.

Anyway... the cards premise is cool,. the idea that you can see what the enemy is doing but at a cost of him seeing you. This is represented quite well in the fact that you can look at and order the encounter deck so you know what is coming at will at the cost of |them\" knowing what you are doing, as represented by the new staging enemies.\n\nThe main problem I have is that the ability to know what is coming in the encounter deck is one of the most powerful effects in the game as it completely allows you to plan perfectly entire turns... you say why would you use this card? I say why would you ever NOT use it.. way to powerful.\n\nStill general idea of the card is good. As i said before, if you took away putting ordered cards on the top of the deck it would be much better... shuffle those cards back instead and the card becomes much better imo, yet still can fit the \"theme\" of the Palantíri."}]}
