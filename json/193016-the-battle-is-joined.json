So it seems like I should be able to use the Wingfoot response to ready the hero, THEN play Quick Ears. For that matter, I should be able to respond with Wingfoot and then exhaust some other character to pay for Quick Ears (to still benefit from the enemy for purposes of Wingfoot). They are both responses to the enemy being revealed, I am just choosing to use one before the other. I understand that Quick Ears makes it so that the enemy was never revealed, but that it not relevant when resolving the Wingfoot response because it (Quick Ears) hasn't happened yet. Surely cancellation does not also perform time travel to negate a previous response which as already resolved? Response resolution in this game becomes less intuitive to me all the time. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\n \n\nJust to clarify, the readying from Wingfoot is not even a response - it is actually a passive that is constantly looking for an enemy to be revealed. The response on Wingfoot is the attached character committing to a quest. This then creates a passive effect which is checking for an enemy to be revealed. The FAQ states that passive effects happen before anything else (other than forced) so it definitely seems like you could wait for this passive effect to ready your Wingfoot-ed hero and then pay the cost for Quick Ears (which is itself a response). With two effects that have the same timing, the first player has always been able to choose the order - I don't see why this should be any different.\n\nEdited November 17, 2015 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1897364","commentId":1897364,"userName":"koriakin97","timestamp":1447790138,"content":"But when revealed effects are also resolved before responses, so strength of will wouldn't cancel them before they happen.

I'm not seeing the problem of readying your hero with Wingfoot first, if it is indeed the same trigger.\n\n \n\nSo people seem to be saying that if you trigger Wingfoot first then play Quick Ears, you need to go back and undo the readying of your Wingfoot hero. I love stuff like this because they allow me to come up with ridiculous scenarios. Here we go:\n\n \n\nYou have a Ranger hero with Wingfoot and Spiders-Web (\"Each time attached hero readies, deal it 1 damage.\") attached to him. Then an enemy is revealed and you ready your Ranger and deal him 1 damage, which happens to kill him. You also have a lore hero with Horn of Gondor attached and currently 0 resources in his pool. So you trigger the horn and give your lore hero a resource. Since this was a nested response triggering off the Wingfoot readying, we still have not moved on from the revealing of the encounter card, so there is still an opportunity to play Quick Ears. Luckily you now have a resource to afford Quick Ears so you play it and cancel the card that was revealed. Now what? You go back in time, bring your hero back to life, and undo the Horn of Gondor resource that allowed you to play Quick Ears in the first place? This is a paradox."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1897933","commentId":1897933,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1447819573,"content":"Hmm... even if we manage to come up with a solution to this Quick Ears/Wingfoot problem (maybe a convincing argument for Wingfoot having to come after Quick Ears? -- it says \"if,\" not \"when\" a card is revealed) -- we'll still run into this problem later on, whenever we get a Response that keys off of cards revealing.   Is it really intended that you roll back the game state if you trigger a cancellation response after triggering other responses?\n\n \n\nI guess we have some already: Merry (Spirit), Gimli (ally), Strider's Path (if we're treating The Door is Closed the same way we treat Quick Ears).\n\n \n\nI see a couple of options..

Anyway, I greatly prefer the use of hypothetical voice to create replacement effects as is done in Magic the Gathering. So the language should be something like \"whenever X would happen, instead Y happens\". The use of the word would indicates clearly that it is a hypothetical scenario (it never actually takes place). As a result of that use of language there is no time travel, no rolling back the game state, no question whether or not Frodo dies (he doesn't). In the case of Seastan's crazy case study the hero dies and gives the resource from Horn of Gondor only if the enemy is actually revealed, not merely hypothetically revealed. Therefore once the hero is dead there is no longer an opportunity to play quick ears. That is how I would resolve it, but that is not how FFG resolves it.

Unfortunately, all the cancellation cards say after it was \"just revealed\" making it really strange.  A Test of Will came out in the Core set before they really had a system for wording things so we could just chock it up to saying that they didn't realize the consequences of saying \"just revealed\" and instead meant it to resolve before it has a chance to be revealed.   Perhaps a FAQ update is in order because based on Caleb's ruling it really seems the card is supposed to be canceled before it does anything. \n\n \n\nThe awkward thing is that I still see no problem with Wingfoot resolving after you cancel a treachery's When Revealed effect with A Test of Will even if we accept that A Test of Will cancels the effects of a treachery before it is revealed.  Cancelling the effects of a treachery before it reveals does not stop it from being revealed right?  It seems that it does, though if you are not allowed to trigger Wingfoot.  But we also know that it doesn't...because keywords like Doomed and Surge would still affect you even if you had cancelled the When Revealed effects and the card must be revealed for those to happen.\n\n \n\nI would think the resolution would be:\n\n \n\n1. Cancel the When Revealed effects of the treachery with A Test of Will (before it is actually revealed)\n\n2.

I'm adding emphasis below: The Door is Closed says \"After an encounter card is revealed from the encounter deck, cancel ITS EFFECTS...\" Quick Ears says \"Exhaust a Dúnedain or Ranger hero to CANCEL AN ENEMY CARD JUST REVEALED from the encounter deck...\" What gets canceled with these? Quick Ears has you cancel the \"enemy card.\" If you play Quick Ears, can you still trigger the Response on Wingfoot (which requires an enemy to have been revealed, if you chose enemy)? Same question for The Door is Closed. This might interact with a previous ruling about canceling damage that was \"just dealt\" (previously ruled that if damage is canceled you can't trigger a response that keys off of damage being dealt). How about in a case like this: in The Battle of Carn Dum, Thaurdir has some nasty effects if a Sorcery-traited treachery card is revealed. If you use The Door is Closed, will they still occur? Or if you have a Goblin Archer from Khazad-dum in the staging area (deal 1 damage when an enemy is revealed), but you use Quick Ears?

There is no need for A Test of Will to \"time travel\" as it cancels the effect. I am not disputing that canceling an effect is treated like the effect never happened. My point was that the timing is muddled because the passive effect from Wingfoot should apply immediately (readying the hero), but that you still have a response window to play Quick Ears. If you do then choose to play Quick Ears it seems very weird that a passive effect which has already been resolved as a side effect of the original effect would also magically \"unresolve\" itself (e.g. you have to exhaust the hero you just readied). I understand why Caleb is ruling it this way, because in LCGs cancelation has always been absolute - but this creates a messy set of response rules. This means that Quick Ears not only cancels the revealed enemy (which is intuitive), but it also requires you to \"unwind\" any passive effects which also triggered from the enemy being revealed (e.g. Thalin, Ithilien Tracker, Wingfoot, etc.), which is decidedly less intuitive.\n\n \n\nI am not even saying that this is the wrong ruling - but it concerns me that this game seems to become vastly more complex with time. Just to be clear, game complexity is not a purely hypothetical or pedantic argument. When I tried modeling the game rules in software, I quickly realized just how complex this game is. Looked at another way, this complexity is a blessing as it all but guarantees that this game will only exist in physical form."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1898622","commentId":1898622,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1447869153,"content":"Dan, I think your signature is very fitting for this thread."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1898756","commentId":1898756,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1447873329,"content":"\n\n\nEdit: Updated flowchart is found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Z-F6r0f2aIlEF8QTuVgHuGQYKsObkxyGwwM4_W978Y/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Z-F6r0f2aIlEF8QTuVgHuGQYKsObkxyGwwM4_W978Y/edit?usp=sharing]\n\n\nEdited November 20, 2015 by Seastan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1898789","commentId":1898789,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1447874384,"content":"Where does The-One-Ring go (Black Riders -> Shadow of the Past)?, in step 4?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1898800","commentId":1898800,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1447874688,"content":"Yes, The One Ring works like a combination of The Door Is Closed and Eleanor (but the card shuffles into the deck and is replaced).

Guarded - I think this resolves identically to Ambush in your structure.  It specifies you resolve the guarded effect when it \"enters the staging area\".\n\n \n\n2.  Hide X (This one is particularly noteworthy because I think you would still have to make the Hide test even if you ended up discarding it with The Door is Closed!).  The rules on Hide tests explicitly state that the Hide test comes before any when revealed effects or forced effects on the same card, BUT it still happens \"When an encounter card is revealed\".  I think there is room for debate that The Door is Closed could cancel or not cancel the Hide test as well...\n\n \n\n3. Prowl X - When does the actual effect of prowl happen?  If you only had 1 Lore resource, could you use it to negate the entire card with The Door is Closed!?

Underworld X - Underworld X triggers when a location \"enters play\".  It says nothing about \"when it is revealed\".  I believe there was a ruling about when a card enters play during the staging step due to that enemy that makes an attack when it \"enters play\" in Into Ithilien.  I think we need to include in the timing structure for when something \"enters play\" as it seems distinctly different than \"revealed\" and \"enters staging area\".  If I recall the ruling about that enemy in Into Ithilien, I believe the enemy was considered to be \"in play\" before it entered the staging area.  I cannot remember if it came before or after it was \"revealed\".  I think it happens immediately before after your Step 1 (so that Thalin and Expecting mischief can damage it first)...but I think that makes things awkward and more complicated...\n\n \n\n5.  Villagers X - This follows the same structure as Underworld X.  \"When it enters play\".\n\nEdited November 18, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1898851","commentId":1898851,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1447876446,"content":"Regarding the Underworld example.  Keep in mind that there is the card \"Sewers\" which has Underworld 1 and also has a When Revealed effect.  This means that if you resolve Underworld 1 before you have a chance to cancel the card with The Door is Closed, the rules on Underworld X say when a location with Underworld X leaves play then you reveal each card underneath it.  This might mean that if you indeed place the 1 card underneath Sewers when it \"enters play\" for Underworld, that even if you cancelled it, it would not cancel the Underworld part...and you would still have to reveal the card that was placed underneath it since it has now \"left play\".\n\nEdited November 18, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1898913","commentId":1898913,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1447880122,"content":"The key to new/unlisted keywords is that under this guide, they would always initiate in step 2.

It seems odd to me that an enemy could die before it has even entered play and that damage can be assigned to it while the card is still in \"limbo\". The thing that makes this especially problematic is that \"Immune to player card effects\" only applies while a card is in play - which implies that Thalin could effect such enemies revealed from the encounter deck since they are not technically in play while his passive effect is damaging them.\n\n \n\nThis game is starting to accumulate some rather interesting rules cruft. It's fine once you understand the errata, and is especially benefitted by efforts like Seastan's above (which absolutely should be part of the rule back). The real challenge comes when trying to explain a particular ruling to new or more casual players. I remember when I was trying to explain to Mrs. Beorn one of the timing issues with Thalin and she looked at me like I was making the rules up. Not that I can blame her, as some of these corner cases feel almost arbitrary."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1899075","commentId":1899075,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1447888023,"content":"So I just made a massive re-edit.

Additionally, cards that are immune to player card effects cannot be chosen as targets of player card effects.\n\n \n\nWe know from prior rulings (Beorn/Fortune or Fate) that the card must be \"in play\" in order for its immunity to be in effect.  However, if we are to assume that cards are \"considered to be in play\" during the staging step in order for them to take damage and have progress placed on them, we must also assume that in considering that they are in play, their game text must also be active.  I think this would also apply to those cards that say this:\n\n \n\nDreary-Hills.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Hobbit-Over-Hill-and-Under-Hill/Dreary-Hills.png]\n\n \n\nIf we say this card's game text is not active, then Warden of Arnor could place 1 progress here and it would not require you to discard a card.  Also, If Eastern Crows game text is not active, then why is its game text active when Thalin destroys it - Can we find confirmation of this ruling - I'm not sure if it was confirmed?  It seems that we have a precedent that the cards are somehow in play even though they never actually \"entered play\".  The term entered play is specific in its meaning.  It, apparently, means \"entered the staging area or a players engagement area\".  This is shown by the ruling that Ambush happens \"when it enters play\" and we've been told that ranger spikes can attach before Ambush triggers.  This means that enters play = entering the staging area (and also a players engagement area in the case that the card added to your engagement area somehow bypassed the staging step - numerous cards do this).\n\nEdited November 19, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1900488","commentId":1900488,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1447973349,"content":"Here is what I found on Eastern Crows + Thalin:\n\n \n\n \n\n> booored maybe you are remembering that \"discarded\" and \"defeated\" are different (i.e., you can't trigger Landroval if Borormir uses his self-discarding action because he wasn't \"defeated\")\n> \n>  \n> \n> But official replies from Nate, along with the game manual, that \"defeated\" means a character leaving play as a result of damage tokens being placed on it.\n> \n>  \n> \n> \"Defeated and destroyed both refer to a character or enemy receiving damage that reduces its hit points to zero, and then being placed in the appropriate discard pile.\"\n> \n>  \n> \n> origin thread is here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/7608788#7608788 [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/7608788#7608788]\n> \n>  \n> \n> edit: if \"defeated\" referred only to damage from combat, Landroval couldn't save heroes who die from Treachery card effects either.\n\n \n\n1.

A special case. Consider Surge to be initiated now but only resolve it after this card fully resolves, even if this card leaves play from an effect like Eleanor.\" in EACH step of our guide...which is...ugly.\n\n \n\nI think this mostly applies to Doomed also with Doomed applying immediately and not just at the end like Surge.\n\nEdited November 20, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1901234","commentId":1901234,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1448033953,"content":"If you compiled all of this into one big rules query to Caleb/Matt -- say, Seastan cleaned up and finalized his guide to revealing and asked, \"Does this cover it?\" -- I like to imagine the response would just be a link to a new FFG press release about LotR LCG 2.0. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\n(...please don't make them reboot...)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1901256","commentId":1901256,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1448034770,"content":"> If you compiled all of this into one big rules query to Caleb/Matt -- say, Seastan cleaned up and finalized his guide to revealing and asked, \"Does this cover it?\" -- I like to imagine the response would just be a link to a new FFG press release about LotR LCG 2.0. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n> \n>  \n> \n> (...please don't make them reboot...)\n\n \n\nMaybe they are just trying to outdo the US tax law as the most complicated rule book in history :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]\n\nEdited November 20, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1901269","commentId":1901269,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1448035384,"content":"I noticed some time ago that cards that \"gain surge\" or \"gain doomed\" as part of their When Revealed effect have apparently missed their chance to resolve these keywords.

And if it does, it means it has to push Don't Be Hasty forward too in order to trigger before Peril resolves.\n\n \n\nI'm more inclined to believe that the different usage of the word \"reveals\" versus \"revealed\" is irrelevant and we should put it with the other keywords.\n\nI agree with Toughness.\n\nEdited November 21, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1902704","commentId":1902704,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1448112670,"content":"My doubt still is: Can Door is close cancel Foe Beyond?

In all honesty, Toughness shouldn't even be on Seastan's framework, since its trigger is not dependent on when it is revealed, merely that the card text is active (meaning that the card is not in the discard pile, encounter deck, or out of play--please note that \"in the victory display\" is not \"out of play\").

It's like you didn't actually read what I posted. If a card with an \"immune to player cards\" ability is in play (i.e. not i the encounter deck, discard pile, or \"out-of-play\"), the ability is on. It certainly does not \"trigger\" when a player card is played. As per FAQ §1.47, that card does not \"cancel the effects\" of player cards, it merely ignores them entirely. Additionally, card effects that ask for a target (ex. core set Gandalf's Response) may not target those cards. It is important to note that placing progress tokens on an active location via questing successfully, traveling to a new active location as normal during the Travel Phase, engaging the enemy as normal during the Engagement Phase, and standard attacks made during the Combat Phase (as well as those prompted by an encounter or quest card effect) are not \"card effects,\" they are \"framework effects,\" and thus are not affected by \"immune to player card effect\" abilities.\n\n \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nToughness is unlike Defense, and here's why: When you attack, you compare the attacker's Attack value to the defender's Defense value, the positive difference of which is dealt as damage. Simply put, Defense is not \"damage reduction,\" it is a comparative statistic. Toughness is instead damage reduction, in that whenever a card with Toughness receives damage, regardless of the source, the incoming damage is reduced by its Toughness value. Ranger Bow actions, Poisoned Stakes, Forest Patrol, core set Gandalf response, Anborn (Ld) response, Beechbone Response, Descendant of Thorondor Response, Beorning Beekeeper Response, Dwarrodelf Axe Response, hero Boromir's second action (the discard one), Farmer Maggot's Response, Expecting Mischief, Firefoot's \"excess damage\" Response, Fresh Tracks, etc...none of these are immune to the damage reduction capabilities of the toughness keyword. None of these can get around it. Thalin cannot either.\n\n \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nIf you want to debate further, be my guest.\n\nEdited November 22, 2015 by caelenvasius"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1903421","commentId":1903421,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1448185230,"content":"Local Trouble [Heirs of Numenor] is a good example of a passive ability with a \"trigger\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1903472","commentId":1903472,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1448195453,"content":"Caelenvasius. You are a typical intellectual bully. There are people on these forums, like GrandSpleen, who have been doing these discussions in depth for months, if not years. They have demonstrated far more knowledge, consistently, than anything I have seen from you. I saw you first comment here like a day ago. All of a sudden you are flooding the forums with long posts that come across as arrogant, condescending, and self important, but not smart. People like you win debates by focusing on minute and largely irrelevant details and by drawing distinctions without and significant difference, then mock and belittle others for not noticing the same small aspect. Yet, often, these small details are merely arbitrary descriptive strategies that mean very little. I shall answer your questions in the most complete and destructive way I can because I want you to either develop some humility or stop posting on these forums.\n\nHere we go. According to the philosopher William James the meaning of a word or phrase is significant only in its practical use. If two words end up with the same practical use then the two words really mean the same thing. It is interesting to note, for instance, that when the words \"and\" and \"but\" are transcribed using symbols from symbolic logic the words are represented by the same symbol because in logical mechanisms the two words offer no difference in their practical use.\n\nLet's apply that to our discussion here. I stated that the phrase \"immune to player card effects\" can be described as a triggered ability, using the same logic you employed to call toughness a triggered ability. I never said that it IS described that way, but merely that it CAN BE (it is like you didn't bother to read what I said). You did not refute this point, nor, honestly, appear to understand it. My point was that the designation of toughness as a passive ability or not a passive ability was entire arbitrary. It was not a logically necessary conclusion based on whether or not the ability included a trigger.\n\nYou said, \"I'm not sure how you can reconcile these two quotes,\" referring to a claim you made and a claim I made. I am not sure why reconciling those two quotes is my job. It seemed abundantly clear according to standard communication techniques that the expressed purpose of my claim was to contradict your claim. By the very nature of my attempt to contradict you it would seem that I would want to put forth a statement that could not be reconciled with your statement as it would, you know, contradict it. But nevertheless let me attempt to do something similar to what I think you meant to say.\n\nI think you meant to say that my thesis was already refuted by your comment, and since I had failed to address what you had said the burden of proof was still on me. Okay, so what is your point? It seems that you are saying that \"immune to player card effects\" is passive because it is always there. It doesn't just pop up when triggered. For the life of me, I have no clue how you think that this is any kind of valid argument. In what sense does toughness \"go away\" when it is not being triggered? How exactly is immunity more present than toughness? Honestly, it is just bizarre.\n\nYou attempt to refute my point by saying that immunity does not \"cancel\" player card effects; it \"ignores\" them. Wow, zing. Because there is a noticeable difference between cancel and ignore?? Even if it does ignore the effects, isn't the act of ignoring triggered?\n\nYou said, \"it certainly does not 'trigger' when a player card is played.\" This is an error on several levels. First, of course immunity triggers when a player card is played. How is it not? If it wasn't triggered then the player card would work. Second, I never said it triggered of a player card anyway; I specifically said it triggered off player card effects, canceling them. All you did was assert that I was wrong, but asserting something doesn't make it true, even when done condescendingly. This point is made very clear by your own reasoning in the following section.\n\nYou go on to explain how toughness works in contrast to defense (as though I don't already know).

I would however ask that you kindly refrain from character assassinations in the future. Such comments are unkind and unnecessary, especially considering that they do not further the purpose and goals of this thread. I have not once in this thread, or indeed this board, mocked or belittled anyone. Everyone is treated with respect and neutrality until such time as they prove that they don't deserve it (at which point, instead of indulging myself, I ignore them, removing the problem before it becomes as such). Arguing with folk in a place of debate is not intrinsically disrespectful and it is most certainly not akin to bullying. It is instead for the sake of furthering concepts and the goals of this thread to establish a cleaner and more reliable framework.\n\n \n\nI will agree that humility is not one of my strong points, in personal interactions or in online ones. I feel strongly about what I know, and I wish to share it with those around me, especially when their goals align with mine. I'm not so stubborn as to believe myself infallible (for example, my play group had been playing the Guarded keyword a bit incorrectly for sometime), but I'm not changing my opinions and statements based on incomplete or ill-stated comments, or assumptions based on false understandings. And indeed it is irksome when I spend a great amount of my free time to add to the topic, even to the point of taking a concept down to its very base level and someone like yourself refuses to see it as valid (remembering that validity and correctness are not synonymous) and instead of trying to advance the debate, descend to personal attacks and mockery.\n\n \n\n> I never said that it IS described that way, but merely that it CAN BE (it is like you didn't bother to read what I said).\n\nYou ascribed that capability to my logic in the prior posts. That is was I was refuting; I have never described immunity as a triggered ability, and have always kept the delineation between triggered and passive abilities clear and distinct. Saying that somehow I confused my own reasoning, when I clearly have not, is asinine and untrue.\n\n \n\n> My point was that the designation of toughness as a passive ability or not a passive ability was entire arbitrary. It was not a logically necessary conclusion based on whether or not the ability included a trigger.\n\nExcept that it's very much not arbitrary in the slightest. By definition, a triggered ability cannot be passive. It needs must be active all the time (if inactive then the trigger and its resolution effectively cease to exist) but that in and of itself does not make it passive. By the same token, a passive ability by its definition must not have a trigger. It must be constant from the time the text is active until such time as the text is inactive.\n\n \n\nTo this end, by its very text, \"immune to player card effects\" must be passive. The text does not say \"when a player card effect targets or would otherwise effect this card, ignore it.\" This would make it a triggered ability. Instead, it simply constantly ignores player card effects, despite the existence or non-existence of relevant player card abilities.\n\n \n\nAnd yes, I again used \"ignore\" instead of \"cancel.\" Why? It's more than just how the developers have written it in the FAQ; \"cancel the effect\" and \"ignore the effect\" are completely separate things. In the former, the effect is treated as if it never happened (thus canceling it for all possible targets in the case of a board-wide effect). In the latter, the effect simply doesn't exist for that one card (thus not preventing it from affecting other potential targets in the case of a board-wide effect).\n\n \n\nLet's take for example the passive ability of the Lore hero Pippin, which states: \"Each enemy in play gets +1 engagement cost for each Hobbit hero you control.\" Let's say Pippin's controller also controls the heroes Merry and Sam. There are three enemies in play, one of which is immune to player card effects. If immunity was a \"cancel\" effect, for as long as that enemy remained in play, the other two enemies would not increase their engagement cost, since canceling Pippin's ability means it [temporarily] ceases to exist. As immunity is \"ignore\" instead, the other two enemies increase their engagement cost by three as per Pippin's ability, but the immune enemy does not.\n\n \n\nI hope this clears up my point about cancel vs ignore.\n\n \n\n> You said, \"I'm not sure how you can reconcile these two quotes,\" referring to a claim you made and a claim I made. I am not sure why reconciling those two quotes is my job. [...] that I would want to put forth a statement that could not be reconciled with your statement as it would, you know, contradict it.\n\nBy making a claim to one thing, when evidence had long clearly shown another, they are not reconcilable. [Need I remind you that \"reconcilable\" does not mean \"in agreement,\" as you seem to think, but rather \"capable of being compatible,\" as in \"the refutation is relevant to the refuted statement?\"] The burden of proof of why your statement is meaningful thus falls on you. If I very clearly state in post 122 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/page-7#entry1903326] that \"\"immune to player card effects\" is not dependent on a card targeting it to activate,\" and you try to state that I wrote something else entirely (\"By your logic you can describe \"immune to player card effects\" as a cancelation [sic.] effect that triggers whenever you try to use player card effects.\"), you're either grossly misreading/misunderstanding, or you're making an improper conflation.\n\n \n\nEither way, the burden of proof falls on you. How does \"immunity text does not require player card effects to be active\" mean the same thing as \"immunity text triggers when a player uses a player card effect?\"\n\n \n\n> In what sense does toughness \"go away\" when it is not being triggered?\n\nIt does not, nor does any other ability \"go away\"—at least until the card is out of play, at which point the card's text box is for all intents and purposes blank (or in the rare case that a card effect instructs you to treat the text box as if it were blank). It merely waits active but unresolved until triggered, like all other triggered abilities. In the case of Toughness, the trigger being \"the card with Toughness receiving damage.\"\n\n \n\n> How exactly is immunity more present than toughness?\n\nPassive abilities are by their nature more emanant than triggered abilities, since the former does not require the fulfillment of a prerequisite to resolve and continues to be active for the duration of the effect. Only when the prerequisite effect has occurred does a triggered ability become present, at least as far as its game effects are concerned, and once it is finished resolving it returns to inactivity. Once more, the distinction lies clearly within the nature of \"triggered ability\" itself.\n\n \n\nOne may think of it like this: any ability has two separate but related binary switches as components. The first one, labeled \"card text is active,\" must be on for the second switch, labeled \"card text is resolving\" to also be on. Should the first switch turn off, the second one defaults to off as well. For passive abilities, images that the switches have a bar that connects them, such that they turn on or off simultaneously: as long as the card is active, the ability is resolving. Should the card become inactive, so does the ability. Triggered abilities lack that bar, and have additional levels of complexity: the second switch does not turn on automatically, but instead must be manually flipped (by fulfilling the prerequisite trigger). Then, once the switch has finished cycling, it defaults back to off.\n\n \n\nNow, imagine that these switches control the flow of power to a light source, one that is labeled \"presence\" (to borrow your word). Both switches must be on for the light to receive power. For the passive set of switches, it's easy for it to be \"on\" since all that it requires is the first switch to be flipped. The triggered light is on far less often than the passive one though, for not only must both switches be flipped separately, but the second one must be continuously re-flipped for the light to be on. Thus, the passive light is more emanant (or present) than the triggered one.\n\n \n\n> You make it very clear that all damage is reduced by toughness. Oh, so you mean it is on all the time? So, you mean it certainly doesn't \"trigger\" when a player card is played?\n\nFirst of all, Toughness does not trigger upon the playing of a player card. I'll forgive you for that one, since you spent the few paragraphs prior discussing immunities. Moving on...\n\n \n\nTo reference my \"switch\" example above, Toughness as a keyword is active while it is in play (i.e. the first switch), but is not triggered until damage is applied (i.e. the second switch). This is taken straight from the full rules text for the keyword, presented here, though swapped around for your edification and convenience: \"each time [an enemy with Toughness] is assigned any amount of damage[, reduce] the amount of damage it takes by X.\" Thus, taking damage constitutes as a trigger, and reducing the damage by X constitutes a response. If the card with Toughness is not taking damage, Toughness is not resolving, despite the text itself being active. This, in keeping with all of the definitions and examples above, makes Toughness a triggered ability.\n\n \n\nAs a further example, let us examine the Surge keyword. The full rules text for Surge state that it resolves \"when revealed.\" Thus, if a card is added to the staging area, or to a player's engagement area, without being \"revealed\" first, Surge cannot resolve. To parrot the phrasing I used a few sentences ago, if the card with Surge is not being revealed, Surge is not resolving, despite the text itself being active.\n\n \n\n------------------------------\n\n \n\nI do hope that this veritable mountain of text clarifies my position, and their relation (or lack thereof) to your comments, beyond a shadow of a doubt. There was, in all honesty, some amount of confusion that added to the troubles, at least some of which I'm for to blame; hence, my long-winded, carefully crafted post. Rest assured, I am not angry at you for disagreeing with me—indeed, I like pleasant debates more often than not—but I do dislike character assassinations and mocking tone, especially when I'm being deadly serious.\n\n \n\nI look forward to your response (absolutely zero sarcasm intended), but I hope that when it comes it is civil and on topic.\n\n \n\n[Edited for minor spelling and grammar.]\n\nEdited November 22, 2015 by caelenvasius"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?do=findComment&comment=1903648","commentId":1903648,"userName":"caelenvasius","timestamp":1448208584,"content":"> Local Trouble [Heirs of Numenor] is a good example of a passive ability with a \"trigger\".\n\nUnfortunately, it is not.\n\n \n\nHere is the full text:\n\n> When Revealed: Attach this card to the hero with the highest threat cost without a copy of Local Trouble attached.

Clearly, Beregond's ability has a trigger. Yet Caelenvasius said that his ability is not dependant on a card being played on him. Clearly, Caelenvasius is wrong. He tried to counter this by talking about global buffs, like Pippen's because global buffs are the one passive effect that does not have a trigger (that U can thint of right now).

A Test of Will uses the \"just revealed\" phrase, yet we have a ruling [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1023430/prowl-timing-vs-test-will] that says that the Prowl keyword triggers before it and can leave you with no resources to play A Test of Will. Meanwhile the Quick Ears ruling, which also uses \"just revealed\", has to resolve before anything in order for it to make sense."}]}
