The point of having several copies of a unique card in your deck is to\n\na) improve the chance of drawing it\n\nb) have a chance to replace it after it left play"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42908-celebrians-stone/?do=findComment&comment=429556","commentId":429556,"userName":"Allavandrel","timestamp":1298627471,"content":"Why do you think there will be three copies of each card in the adventure packs?\n\nThe update on adventure packs said that \"These fixed 60 card decks include a new Hero, three copies of nine unique player cards, and the Encounter and Quest cards devoted to the included scenario\".

Assuming they have enough other cards to provide them with a whole deck still, obviously. Not sure that would be neccessary though\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42908-celebrians-stone/?do=findComment&comment=443530","commentId":443530,"userName":"DrNate","timestamp":1300998461,"content":" I think that the \"one copy in play\" rule makes sense for a co-operative card game. It also adds an extra layer of strategy, which player would contribute most to our victory by having this card attached to a hero? Good stuff. "}]}
