We haven't even seen the friggin' rules and only a handful of cards, so how do you suppose to be able to judge if something is 'overpowered'?\n\n2. Who, do you think will complain about an 'overpowered' hero card? The encounter deck?\n\nThis is a cooperative game. A party of heroes tries to defeat a deck. If the heroes are 'too' strong, the deck is too weak, or vice versa. The solution is simple: Create a tougher encounter deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39639-sneak-attack-overpowered/?do=findComment&comment=397117","commentId":397117,"userName":"Enies","timestamp":1292557047,"content":"Sly said:\n\nHey Guys,\n\n \n\nI'm very excited about the game...so far.

Sure we have to have Sneak Attack AND Gandalf on the hand. Further, as mentioned several times Gandalf's text reads \"After you play Gandalf from your hand\" and Sneak Attack reads \"Put 1 ally card into play from your hand. \" So there might be a distinction rulewise as in other games.

You don't want any single combination to be significantly above the power curve of other available options.\n\nBut, if we can wait two weeks, our questions about this combination, and the game itself, should be answered.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39639-sneak-attack-overpowered/?do=findComment&comment=448045","commentId":448045,"userName":"DrNate","timestamp":1301779535,"content":" I personally CAN'T WAIT two weeks, but I shall do my best. \n\nDeep breaths. "}]}
