But they learned from their mistakes and these days things like that don't happen anymore (afaik) except it's exactly what they want (a great example being the end of \"a knife in the dark\"; completely destroyed me the first time, but that was supposed to happen and probably will always happen if I play it the same way again so everything is cool :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])\n\n \n\nAnyway, did you have the ressources to pay for lore of Imladris? In case you did, I would always \"house rule\" that I am allowed to play it during the 3rd stage or to assume I did play it during the action window of the last quest stage as the ONLY reason I lost is bad design (and Count the game as a win ofc). Would I ever loose again if everything goes the same way, but I know about the last stage? No (the main and for me important difference to a knife in the dark), FFG just thought it increases replayability if everyone looses their first try -,-\n\n \n\n \n\nI am sorry if I sound a little angry/upset, JtR is one of my least favorite quests as it combines the need to find certain Encounter Cards with a good amount of time pressure and I neither like the one nor the other."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227352-blind-play-through-disasters/?do=findComment&comment=2360412","commentId":2360412,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1470953810,"content":"It's a terrible quest, for sure."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227352-blind-play-through-disasters/?do=findComment&comment=2361109","commentId":2361109,"userName":"Srba","timestamp":1470989246,"content":"Last week I played the second scenario from Over Hill and Under Hill blind three players.

Sadly i am finding that many quests after Dwarrowdelf i have to tweak the rules to enjoy solo play - i think the designers upped the difficulty and forgot solo players after the first two cycles. I know they have an easy level but this removes cards you want to play against, far better would have been to have some alternative rules for solo play in each pack.

The Stalking the Ruins Card which adds resources until you complete a quest really for solo should have been a time card which resets after every 3 counters bringing the dragon into play for one round and then disappearing. I guess its easier with 4 players as you can share the dragon around while he is play. This is an example that i think should have specifically been written into the rules of the scenario - do x for multi deck play but y for solo - i dont find it too hard to work out what makes a better rule so i cant see why the designers paid for this cant do a bit better at broadening the game ideas and make the solo gameplay more solid.
