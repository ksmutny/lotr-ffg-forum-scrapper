You commit character to the quest and exhaust him as well. Light of valinor prevent exhaust but characters is commit anyway.\n\nSo threat is not going up.\n\nAnother thing about Him is: Before the most good solo deck was 3 sphere deck but now with new Glorifindel you can combine spirit with only 1 sphere and Leadership cards like Sneak Attack and Steward of Gondor can be pass. You can really now build up strong (Rule tnem all) solo deck: Spirit/lore."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65915-a-little-confusion-over-the-first-age-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=643849","commentId":643849,"userName":"Quit2","timestamp":1339561837,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\nWell, I was just messing with the title, nowhere said this is the First Age version but if someone can call him Spirindel (or whatever silliness).\n\nAnyway, there's one thing a bit confusing in that article.

You can do both.\n\nIt does not say the courage allows you to ignore the forced effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65915-a-little-confusion-over-the-first-age-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=643854","commentId":643854,"userName":"armakis","timestamp":1339562110,"content":"Yes even with courage you take the +1 menace, it's just to be used and abused (questing + strike at 3f in spirit !)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65915-a-little-confusion-over-the-first-age-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=643862","commentId":643862,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1339563714,"content":"Yes.
