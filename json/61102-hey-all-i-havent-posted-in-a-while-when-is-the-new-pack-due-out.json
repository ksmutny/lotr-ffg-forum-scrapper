But I think it should only be a week or two more.\n\nBut yeah, I think they just took a little extra time since it had completed a full cycle and because we had gotten the Khazad-Dum big expansion. So like a breather before diving in for another full cycle and a chance for people who don't buy everything asap to get all caught up, etc.\n\nA reasonable thing, but man do I NEED some new cards again! ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61102-hey-all-i-havent-posted-in-a-while-when-is-the-new-pack-due-out/?do=findComment&comment=599622","commentId":599622,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1330370956,"content":"Good to hear your opinions guys! Yeah, I can understand the breather; but like you two (and everyone else I am sure), I am siked for some new cards! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] By the way Rich, nice Tolkien humor there...I wonder what Saruman wants with all of those printing presses?
