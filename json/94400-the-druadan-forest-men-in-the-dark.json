It is a poorly worded card. In my opinion the wording of the card means you have a choice. If you can't pay the resource you must take the damage, but if you can pay the resource you choose whether or not to pay the resource or take the damage.\n\nIf you didn't have a choice it would be worded as \"each hero must pay 1 resource. If they cannot, they must take 1 damage.\"\n\nThe last part is more clear. If nobody took damage it gains surge.\n\nEdited December 1, 2013 by Kassad"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94400-the-druadan-forest-men-in-the-dark/?do=findComment&comment=920493","commentId":920493,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1385921939,"content":" \n\nIt is a poorly worded card.\n\n \n\n \n\nDunno, seems crystal clear to me.  The word \"or\" defines the choice pretty well.  And the word \"must\" tells you pretty clearly that you have to do one of them -- if you can't choose to pay (if you have no resources), gotta take the damage.\n\nEdited December 1, 2013 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94400-the-druadan-forest-men-in-the-dark/?do=findComment&comment=921139","commentId":921139,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1386004497,"content":"It is not that clear.
