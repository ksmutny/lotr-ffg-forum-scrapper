I think that is pretty good."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46734-gondorian-spearman/?do=findComment&comment=468035","commentId":468035,"userName":"fabest","timestamp":1305291922,"content":" I like him with Thalin too.

It's ideal to kill off enemies with a high defense."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46734-gondorian-spearman/?do=findComment&comment=468143","commentId":468143,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1305307156,"content":"Nice.

But have also another options. The card text says :when G. Sp. declare as a defender deal 1 damage to attacking enemy. BUT all enemies is attacking. Is mean he can deal the damage  not only the enemy who is fight with him also any other enemies engaged with players. Maybe even with another player in multy-player game. This very interesting aspect.You can deal damage to enemy who is still waiting for resolve or another who is already resolve the attack.Give you more opportunity prevent some shadow effect and so on."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46734-gondorian-spearman/?do=findComment&comment=476330","commentId":476330,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1306635850,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nYes is like this.

I think it was played by the rules although it seemed kinda strange."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46734-gondorian-spearman/?do=findComment&comment=476516","commentId":476516,"userName":"luckritze","timestamp":1306676781,"content":"Actions can be played at any time and should resolve before any new steps / phases kick in.\n\nSounds legal to me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46734-gondorian-spearman/?do=findComment&comment=476544","commentId":476544,"userName":"felix16","timestamp":1306680220,"content":" Actions can be played between steps in combat, so you just use the action after step 2 or 3 of enemy attacks, before step 4 when the attack is actually resolved. Preferably before step 3 to avoid the shadow card."}]}
