The only red window is the very first step when you're dealing the shadow cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83502-been-a-while-fomr-when-i-played-last-rule-questions/?do=findComment&comment=793434","commentId":793434,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1368025195,"content":"booored said:\n\nHey man!

You been playing all this time.. or did you take a break as well?\n\n\n\nI did a longer break (been busy, got Mage Knight), but now I'm paying from time to time. The new cycle seems to be very promising, I am so anxcious to play with these Outlanders and Tactics and so on. Unfortunatly I'll have to wait until June and July before I can get my hands on Doorstep and Steward's Fear."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83502-been-a-while-fomr-when-i-played-last-rule-questions/?do=findComment&comment=795073","commentId":795073,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1368460620,"content":"booored said:\n\n@Glaurung [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/gs_comunity_wizard/gs_user_profile.asp?id_user=57928]\n\nyeah I thought they were very cool.
