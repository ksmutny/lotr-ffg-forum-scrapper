I think “Hidden Strike”, “Ranger Spikes”, “Hands Upon the Bow,” and “Great Yew Bow” are AWESOME, and I’d love to see more like that.  I’d like to see cards that allow you to evade and sneak by enemies and put them back in the encounter deck or discard pile.  This type of thing may already be in the works – I certainly hope so!\n\nThanks for a great game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78254-an-open-letter-to-caleb-grace-more-secrecy-please/?do=findComment&comment=754498","commentId":754498,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1359312318,"content":"I don't get why people think Secrecy is dead.\n\nSecrecy was introduced during 1st Adventure pack of Dwarrowdelf Cycle\nand last Secrecy card was seen in 6th (last) Adventure pack of Dwarrowdelf Cycle.\n\nWe haven't had any 'regular' releases so far.\nLaketown = PoD\nHobbit = Saga expansion\nHoN = Delux expansion (Khazad-Dum did not contain any secrecy cards neither)\n\nWhile Secrecy decks are certainly weak at the moment, I wouldn't be surprised (infact I expect) to see new secrecy cards once the proper cycle begins.\n\nP.S.

I have been saying for a while some of the quests had already been harder coop (I feel some of the criticism was based on a lack of experience in coop); but HoN has certainly gone that way, big time.\n\nAnd yes, so many people were wishing for harder quests overall, and now we got that. The problem is that some of the set ups are so rediculous (which is totally similar to Dol Guldur solo) that you don't really feel the challenge, you just lose very quickly. However, perhaps we shall see cards that will be able to deal with such cases…\n\nAs for secrecy, what the strategy really needs, I feel, is allies. Allies that cost 3 or 4 but have 2 or 3 secrecy discount. It is allies that can step into the shoes of the missing hero(s). Right now the only secrecy good enough to challenge non-secrecy decks is the three-hero with Glorfindel.

To play this card in a secrecy deck you need 1) a lore hero which 2) has a low threat. That's Bifur, Ori, Bilbo and Denethor. Ori and Bilbo already offer advanced card draw, and Bifur can make use of Legacy of Durin to get you more cards.\n\nBut the main point is that there already exists are card that is better than PaT - A Very Good Tale. That is a card that should be in every secrecy deck. Ok, it is  card that should be in every deck.

He can be exremely useful on a secrecy deck, but he is just too expensive. The lack of the secrecy keyword on him is a missed opportunity.\n\n \n\n \n\nI agree that Damrod is perfect for a Secrey deck.  And that is why I think there should NOT be a Secrecy discount on him.  His effect is potentially very powerful, and 4 resources is a reasonable price even for a Secrecy deck, especially considering that he can pull his weight as a well-rounded ally until you need to trigger his effect.\n\nIf we discount every card with a potential Secrecy use, eventually we will end up with a card pool capable of making decks that completely neutralize the resource disadvantage of having only 2 heroes.\n\nIf you slap \"Secrecy 2\" on Damrod, he becomes a no-brainer, must-include card that can potentially reduce your threat by 10 -- or more! -- for a paltry cost of 2 resources--- way too powerful!  His effect would work great as an event, but you get him as an ally too… super bonus!  Even Secrecy 1 would be too high.\n\nYou don't have to print \"Secrecy\" on a card in order to make it good for a Secrecy deck.  Damrod is a good example of a card that makes you think/plan/sacrifice in order to gain his full benefit.  I'm fully convinced that the developers have NOT forgotten Secrecy, and they are approaching it with the long-term in mind.  We didn't see the Secrecy keyword at all in HoN, but HoN gave us some fantastic cards for a Secrecy deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78254-an-open-letter-to-caleb-grace-more-secrecy-please/?do=findComment&comment=757417","commentId":757417,"userName":"MikeTangoGolf","timestamp":1359750360,"content":"GrandSpleen said:\n\n \n\nYou don't have to print \"Secrecy\" on a card in order to make it good for a Secrecy deck. \n\n \n\n \n\nI agree a card doesn’t need the keyword in order to be useful in secrecy decks.\n\nBut overall, do you think the current inventory of cards (both with and without the secrecy keyword) lends itself to truly viable secrecy decks?\n\nI’d posit the answer is no, for the most part, and that is the main problem I am addressing.\n\nI think FFG could introduce some interesting strategies with more options to evade or stealthily execute enemies, rather than confront them openly.  I suspect and hope we'll see more of this as they further develop the hobbit trait.  This fits perfectly from a thematic standpoint.\n\nHere are some rough ideas:\n\n-An elven cloak attachment that allows you to ignore an enemy’s threat when questing (the attachment equivalent of Radagast’s Cunning).\n\n-An event card that allows you to evade an enemy and move it from the staging area back into the encounter deck (either shuffled in or placed at the bottom.)  This would be the staging area equivalent of O Elbereth! Gilthonial!\n\n-An option to place progress tokens on an enemy in the staging area instead of, or in addition to, the active location when questing successfully.  Each progress token would reduce the enemy’s threat by one.

Details could be hammered out in a variety of ways, but in my mind the biggest obstacle to making Secrecy not just viable, but potent, is that enemies and their threat start building up in the staging area.

I've often said that the game seems balanced and tested well for two players, either side of that and you have some serious deviations from the standard encounter experience- either too easy or too hard.\n\nMy solution when introducing new players is twofold. Chuck in a couple of the \"easy\" encounter sets from the core sets or first adventure cycle. This makes the deck larger meaning I dont have to shuffle the **** thing every second round and makes the game a tad easier for the newbies. It's not in many adventures that you wouldn't expect to see a \"generic\" orc or spider or something, so it doesn't take away from the theme. The other one is, that since you basically have to run Elanor, that we errata her that the treachery that she counters DOESN'T get replaced. Done- easy quests, no muss, no fuss, only one person has ever said to me, \"You are supposed to draw a replacement\" so it it doesn't take away from the theme too much. The thing that irks me is that you pretty much have to run Elanor in a four player game, but thats another story.\n\nFor the other extreme, my understanding is that they ARE in fact publishing nightmare modes with encounter card substitutions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78254-an-open-letter-to-caleb-grace-more-secrecy-please/?do=findComment&comment=759505","commentId":759505,"userName":"MikeTangoGolf","timestamp":1360161662,"content":"Very good ideas, Ian.\n\nIn my opinion, the variant recommended in the rule book for new players, eliminating the use of Shadow Cards in combat, eliminates a major part of the gameplay and theme.  It just seems too watered down to be an appropriate introduction to such a great game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78254-an-open-letter-to-caleb-grace-more-secrecy-please/?do=findComment&comment=759682","commentId":759682,"userName":"MikeTangoGolf","timestamp":1360191969,"content":"NotAZombie said:\n\nI have actually made a reasonably successful solo secrecy deck, (not amazing, but it holds its own).
