However it is slightly strange wording, because \"the quest\" is an abstract entity, not a physical card to which it attaches. Contrast \"attach to the current quest stage\" or \"attach to the quest deck\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100323-voi-attach-to-the-current-quest/?do=findComment&comment=999715","commentId":999715,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1393694257,"content":"Maybe i have played it wrong, but when the current quest card is removed to advance to the next stage I have discarded the attachment as if a character just left play.
