On page 9 of the rule book it states, \"For advanced play, the cards in these starter decks can be combined with one another, or further developed with cards from Adventure Pack expansions, to create 50-card tournament decks.\" This implies that a proper tournament deck should be composed of 50 cards. However, page 27 states, \"A tournament deck must contain a minimum of 50 cards.\" So it sounds like you can have every single card you want in your deck with the 3-of-a-kind being the only restriction. \n\nSo I wonder, do people compose player decks of 50 cards because they think (incorrectly) that 50 is the limit? Or is it because limiting your deck size increases the chances of you drawing a card that is key to your current deck's strategy?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59759-number-of-cards-in-player-deck-50/?do=findComment&comment=587202","commentId":587202,"userName":"goblin981","timestamp":1327930032,"content":" People try for 50 to increase the chances on the good cards that work together coming out, as you said.  But there is no upper limit on deck size.  Personally my deck is at 70 cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59759-number-of-cards-in-player-deck-50/?do=findComment&comment=587217","commentId":587217,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1327931015,"content":" I use to do 50 because I misunderstood.  But now I still shoot for 50 because of the reason you noted.  However, lately, I have been playing 50-60 and that actually seems good.  I still shoot to get it down to 50, but if I just can't make any more cuts, I don't."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59759-number-of-cards-in-player-deck-50/?do=findComment&comment=587245","commentId":587245,"userName":"DrNate","timestamp":1327933332,"content":" 60 cards here.

I feel it works best, giving you decent draws and just making the deck run all around smoother. But lately i've been fiddling with three spheres and ended up with 70-75 because of all the decitions there are with three. Each has failed even with the songs and such. I would just keep ending up with stuff in my hand that i didn't need/want at the time. So i try to keep it as slim as possible."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59759-number-of-cards-in-player-deck-50/?do=findComment&comment=587352","commentId":587352,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1327941434,"content":"i tend to keep to most 60, usually 50 but if i feel a card is a must then it goes in"}]}
