I do too. Still, don't you enjoy seeing Middle-earth come to life? You can surely say some of PJ's alterations to the story and characters are unfortunate, unorthodox, or even infantile. But if that is the price for experiencing the grand visuals of the movies then I say let PJ have his fun (and his cash-in as well).\n\n \n\nThe orcs, Rivendell, Khazad-dum, Shire, Ring wraiths, hobbits, Smaug, Gandalf... seeing and hearing the movie versions of these is such a feast for me that I am perfectly fine with being taken on a few detours from the original Tolkien works. \n\n \n\nI for one try to treat PJ's movies (plus the video games, board games, etc.) not as just adapting the stories to a different medium, but as a re-telling of the Tolkien's world. You know, the same as you re-tell a legend to the children by the campfire. It then relieves me from this internal obligation to keep checking whether all is in orthodox Tolkienesque order. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111725-shadow-of-mordor-celebrimbor-is-the-wraith-in-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1179567","commentId":1179567,"userName":"Epi Lepi","timestamp":1406908004,"content":"Movies>>>>>>Books"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111725-shadow-of-mordor-celebrimbor-is-the-wraith-in-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1181476","commentId":1181476,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1407064114,"content":"Everything I read about the gameplay of this game makes me think it could be really cool.\n\nEverytime I read about the fluff they're trying to use to explain the game it makes me wish they'd just created their own setting.\n\nI mean really a lot of the stuff (Orc lieutenants remembering you, breaking up a chain of command) is really interesting to me - but it just doesn't make sense in the setting they chose.\n\n\nThe game would be so much better though if it was set in a setting where the Ranger matched the race of the people - how about the exact same game - set in the Border Princes region of the Warhammer world - using dark magic or a wraith?

(Although tie-in games are also usually bad - so it isn't a guarantee). None of the other lord of the rings games have sold particularly well to make the IP amazingly sort after or a guaranteed success. \n\n \n\nedit: Epic Lepi, my examples were things which I thought did make sense - but for instance being able to stealth around orc camps for ever as a human is highly unbelievable compared to if you were also an orc.\n\nEdited August 4, 2014 by Rapier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111725-shadow-of-mordor-celebrimbor-is-the-wraith-in-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1183832","commentId":1183832,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1407218174,"content":"Mass effect was barrels deeper of a game.
