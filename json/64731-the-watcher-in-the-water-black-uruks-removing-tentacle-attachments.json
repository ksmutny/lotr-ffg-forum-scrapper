During play we quickly got some of our heroes involved with some tent6acle attachments  which rendered them unable to attack and defend and from there it seemed that their only job for the remainder of the game was to quest. However, when a Black Uruks (www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/black-uruks-kd) was revealed from the encounter deck we thought \"great, that is our salvation\". Because the Black Uruks does remove a chosen attachment from a questing hero - thus we removed the tentacle attachment from one of the heroes as this is an attachment just as any other attachment.\n\nOr so we thought. However, what do you reckon? Is this a correct assumption and if not, why not?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64731-the-watcher-in-the-water-black-uruks-removing-tentacle-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=632495","commentId":632495,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1337276975,"content":" That's legal with the cards as written."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64731-the-watcher-in-the-water-black-uruks-removing-tentacle-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=632555","commentId":632555,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1337294402,"content":"Indeed. The \"when revealed\" effect on Black Uruks does NOT require that you control the selected attachment. Barring an official clarification, it's perfectly legal to discard a Tentacle attachment when the Uruks show up. In fact, the Uruks are currently the only card that WILL get rid of such attachments."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64731-the-watcher-in-the-water-black-uruks-removing-tentacle-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=633761","commentId":633761,"userName":"sortylege","timestamp":1337583284,"content":"But even if it is legal, it's a clear mistake or bad wording by FFG.\n\nBlack Uruks are our enemies, they don't help us!

I agree that the card text does not hinder the Black Orcs from helping you with the tentacle attachments but I can also see that it is not that logical theme-wise. However, the card texts and rules are above theme speculations in my book so I will continue to regard the Black Orcs as semi-allies when dealing with the The Watcher.\n\nAnyway, I have sent the question on to support and hope for an official answer which I will post here if I receive it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64731-the-watcher-in-the-water-black-uruks-removing-tentacle-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=643220","commentId":643220,"userName":"Jacob5432","timestamp":1339444455,"content":"OFFICIAL REPLY RECEIVED:\n\n \n\nI have received a reply from Nate French.
