That's why it's taking me so long to play through my collection (not to mention I also collect the Arkham Horror LCG, and have a vast library of games vying for my attention)!\n\nA few cycles/yearsÂ later, I then return to play an earlier cycle's NM versions, both one-handed and two-handed solo. By the time I come back to them, I've forgotten everything (my memory is crap), so it's like everything is new again!Â ðŸ¤ª\n\nAll this to say... great blog post!!!\n\nEdited October 9 by TwiceBorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311754-vision-of-the-palantir-two-player-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3999425","commentId":3999425,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1602231552,"content":"Great read! Thank you for sharing and really enjoyed and agreed with your quest selection.

Working our way through the various player counts, so I suppose 3 player would be next. Redspiderr does have a lot of projects though, so we cannot say for certain when it will be released, but you'll certainly see the promotion of the article once it gets published.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311754-vision-of-the-palantir-two-player-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3999553","commentId":3999553,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1602262744,"content":"Awesome great work guys!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311754-vision-of-the-palantir-two-player-quests/?do=findComment&comment=4000190","commentId":4000190,"userName":"alcuin18","timestamp":1602454313,"content":"Very informative article!
