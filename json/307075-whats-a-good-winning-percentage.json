We didn't play the scenarios blind, so we knew what to expect, and build decks accordingly. If you play blind, you will probably lose once to many quests early on, unless you have an extremely well-optimised deck, because it's hard to cover all scenarios with one deck early on.\n\nAs an alternative data set, I remember playing Angmar Awakened with one partner without significant deck changes and playing the quests blind, and I think we lost 1xWeather Hills, 1xWastes of Eriador, 1xCarn Dum (we lost about half a dozen games where I'd set the encounter deck up wrong too), so you're looking at around 75% playing that way. That feels about right as a target with good decks and a full card pool. Occasionally we encounter a quest that beats us a lot (Fire in the Night is our current nemesis).\n\nI'd expect more losses with solo decks, unless they are extremely strong decks.

right.  Makes me wonder how they avoid getting bad draws from their encounter decks which mess things up early.  There are only so many cards you can start with.  Even if you have a super Vilya deck, you still have to draw Vilya.  \n\nI doubt that LOTR \"grandmasters\" win virtually every game they play, or 95% of them even, for two reasons:\n\n1) They don't play non-nightmare versions of quests that have nightmare versions.\n\n2) They don't, to my knowledge, generally spend their time constructing the optimal deck for a *particular quest* before playing it -- the exceptions are the rare quests that are very difficult to beat and/or are unfriendly to an all-around deck (for example, Mount Doom).\n\nI specifically named Rouxxor, and he publishes optimized archtype decks, but they are optimized for the whole mass of quests instead of one particular quest.  I think even I could construct a deck that wins 95% of the time against non-nightmare Mount Gram or Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim, but wouldn't be particularly good against other quests.\n\nThe other things that a \"grandmaster\" has that mere mortals lack is a deep knowledge of both their deck *and* the quest.  Before the quest ever starts, they know exactly what is in the encounter deck, exactly how to use every card in their deck, and have a strategy for everything.  They know when to turtle, when to rush, when to take undefended attacks, when to ignore questing and take the threat raise, etc.\n\nIn the case of a Vilya deck, you certainly want Vilya in play ASAP.  But it's worth remembering that before Vilya shows up, Elrond is quite a powerful hero in his own right, 3/2/3/4 with two useful abilities (increasing healing, playing for allies of any sphere).  And Vilya decks are chock full of powerful allies.\n\nWhat are the odds of getting Vilya quickly?  Let's take an example early Vilya deck, not optimized but I think very typical, my Stereotypical non-Gandalf Vilya deck:\n\nhttps://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/11043/a-stereotypical-non-gandalf-vilya-deck-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/11043/a-stereotypical-non-gandalf-vilya-deck-1.0]\n\nIt's a 50 card deck with 3 copies of Vilya.  In a 50-card deck, there's a 32% chance of a 3x card showing up in the first 6 cards and 37% in the first 7, meaning the odds of NOT getting Vilya are about 43%.  So what then?  Well, you have Beravor to draw cards.  You have 2 copies of Gleowine to draw a card.  You have 3 copies of Daeron's Runes to draw two cards.  You have 3 copies of Imladris Stargazer to reorder the next five cards.  You have three copies of Master of the Forge to fetch an attachment from the next five cards -- and all three of those allies are 2-cost, affordable in the first round.  The odds of having *none* of them in your first hand are pretty slim, and with Beravor drawing cards even those rare cases won't last long.\n\nAnd the deck's not helpless without Vilya.  The heroes by themselves can quest for 10, or defend for 3 and counterattack for 5.  There's enough starting strength that it'll be a rare quest where they can't stay afloat while waiting for Vilya.\n\nLet's do 20 draws from the deck and see how long it takes to find Vilya.\n\n1) Vilya in initial draw\n\n2) Vilya in mulligan\n\n3) Daeron's Runes in opening hand, Vilya 10th card.  1st turn play with Beravor's help, 3rd turn without.\n\n4) Vilya in mulligan\n\n5) Daeron's Runes and Master of Forge in inital hand, Imladris Stargazer drawn with Daeron's Runes.  Master of Forge whiffs on first and second round with or without Beravor, Stargazer misses on turn two after Forge -- but the drawn card from third round is Vilya.\n\n6) Vilya drawn after Mulligan (7th card)\n\n7) Vilya in mulligan\n\n8 ) Vilya in initial draw\n\n9) no draw cards but Gandalf in starting hand.  8th card another Gandalf, 10th card Stargazer, 16th card Gleowine, 17th card Daeron's Runes, 18th Master of Forge, 19th Daeron's Runes, 21st Vilya.  That's *deep* in the deck for a 3x card, but how many turns would it take to get there, if you prioritized card draw?\n\nTurn 1 -- draw through card 9 with Beravor\n\nTurn 2 -- Gandalf + Beravor get you through card 16, giving you Stargazer and Gleowine.\n\nTurn 3 -- Beravor gets you through card 19, two Daeron's Runes will get you Vilya and play it right away.  That's right, you can play Vilya on turn three with it being the *21st* card in the deck.\n\n10) Vilya in initial draw\n\n11) Vilya in initial draw\n\n12) Vilya in initial draw (actually *all three* Vilya in inital draw -- that's not optimal)\n\n13) Vilya in initial draw\n\n14) Vilya in initial draw\n\n15) Vilya in inital draw\n\n16) Vilya in initial draw\n\n17) Imladris Stargazer in post-mulligan hand.  Vilya 11th card, so initial stargazer can put it on top and it can be played 2nd turn.\n\n18) Vilya drawn after mulligan (7th card)\n\n19) Vilya in initial draw\n\n20) Vilya in initial draw\n\nWe were lucky in these 20 in how often Vilya came up in our first hand, far higher than the expected 57%, but in the cases where it was missed you could play it no later than the 3rd turn, even when the first copy was buried 21 cards deep.  And with these allies and heroes, there's a lot of quests you can beat without ever playing Vilya at all!  This *isn't* an optimized deck -- just a stereotypical early Vilya deck.  The whole deck has but a single card in it released after Shadow and Flame (Thror's Map from OHUH, which I only ever use as a sideboard card)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307075-whats-a-good-winning-percentage/?do=findComment&comment=3918431","commentId":3918431,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1585019217,"content":">

A lot of new players will choose to play progression style for a number of reasons, but in general all you can assume about a progression player is that they are only using cards which were available at the time the quest was released.\n\nIf you compare new players to experienced players then you would naturally expect the newer players to have a lower win rate and that's fine.\n\nI'll give you an example of my own recent experience. I'm not a veteran of the game by any stretch, but I think I have been playing long enough (2.5 years) that I'm no longer \"new\".\n\nI only recently picked up the last packs from the Ringmaker cycle, the final one I needed to complete outside the current one, and played through the whole thing. I used a pair of decks which were not optimised for the quests and were *not* progression style, but apart from the deluxe I was playing the scenarios blind. My win rate against the six new quests playing blind was 33%. On the replays the win rate was much higher.\n\nAt the same time I've been starting a new Saga campaign. This is my second run through - the first was on easy mode with a friend but this time I'll be running two handed solo on normal. With strong decks (one is a Vilya deck) which are tweaked a little for the quests I'm so far 5/5 including the PODs. These are not the hardest quests and things like knowing which treachery I need to cancel go a long way towards getting a win, but there's always a chance that a horrible staging step could ruin everything. I definitely am not expecting to keep this rate of success going as the quests get harder.\n\nAll of this to say that I think a prepared/experienced player, even playing progression style, will probably expect to win more that the unprepared player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307075-whats-a-good-winning-percentage/?do=findComment&comment=3918581","commentId":3918581,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1585060444,"content":"> 10 hours ago, Vince79 said:\n> \n> Then considering that I don't even look at the quest cards before I start a scenario, maybe shooting for a 50% win rate isn't that bad after all.\n> \n> Still, I have a lot to learn.\n\nI’d say 50% is darned good! 🙂"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307075-whats-a-good-winning-percentage/?do=findComment&comment=3918590","commentId":3918590,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1585061981,"content":"> 12 hours ago, Vince79 said:\n> \n> Okay, it appears that I was wrong.  This is why I asked the question in the first place.  Apparently I have to get waaaay better at deck building, or just use some of the more popular decks on Ringsdb, which claim to beat the great majority of quests on the first try.  I was thinking if I could win 50%, that would be a good winning percentage, but apparently I've set the bar far too low.  I don't have much of a gaming community at all where I live, so I'm pretty much on my own here.\n> \n> The reason I wanted video was not for proof - someone could just keep shooting a scenario until they won.  I just wanted to see how they were doing what they were doing.  I want to see what it is I'm doing wrong.  I almost wonder where the challenge is in the game if people are winning 95% though.\n> \n> One thing I do is I usually just fold and give up if I get a hero killed early on (in the first couple rounds).  That's always seemed reasonable to me.  Or would a good player be able to easily overcome such a thing?\n\nI don't think you *have* to do anything. If your specific goal is to get as high a win percentage as possible, then yes you want to be looking for the most optimal decks, but most players (myself included) would rather stick to choosing decks which are fun to play and trying to make them work as well as possible. And if you think 50% is a good winning percentage, it doesn't matter if other people have higher ones, so long as you're enjoying playing the game.\n\nFor the record, I also usually upload my losses, because I think there's also value in seeing how things can go wrong. When I don't upload losses it's generally not because I don't want to show myself losing but because I don't think the specific footage would be that interesting to watch. Also, there's a reason I responded to your initial comment about 80% rather than the 95. As mentioned, I don't track my win percentage, but 80% I think is plausible, 95 I don't.\n\nGetting a hero killed early on does generally herald a loss, unless it was planned. It's situational though, sometimes you can struggle through it. Related to some of my above points, making videos has encouraged me to play on a bit more often when things look busted, because I know some people are interested to see a game played out to the end even if it's a loss; on the other hand there are often times, and an early hero loss can be one of these, where it's very easy to see how one thing going wrong is going to cascade into more things going wrong and an inevitable loss (e.g. losing a hero early on often means the engaged enemy which just killed them is still there and you don't have a good means of dealing with it). Again, what matters is that you're enjoying the game, and the rare occasions where you can recover from an early hero loss for most people do not outweigh the many more occasions when playing it on means letting yourself in for an additional half hour of pain and hopelessness.\n\n> 10 hours ago, Vince79 said:\n> \n> Then considering that I don't even look at the quest cards before I start a scenario, maybe shooting for a 50% win rate isn't that bad after all.\n> \n> Still, I have a lot to learn.\n\nI mean, I also don't do that when I'm playing a *new* quest. I enjoy playing quests blind on the first attempt, and I think my win percentage is still decent, certainly over 50. Even without knowing the details of what's coming, a lot of experience playing the game means you have a good idea of what problems you may have, you can compare that to the strengths of your own deck, etc. But if I've played a quest before, especially if I've played it multiple times, then I remember a lot of the important points I really need to be aware of."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307075-whats-a-good-winning-percentage/?do=findComment&comment=3918893","commentId":3918893,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1585095307,"content":"> 9 hours ago, PocketWraith said:\n> \n> Even without knowing the details of what's coming, a lot of experience playing the game means you have a good idea of what problems you may have\n\nI've been trying to play the game in order or release (mostly), and I'm up to Voice of  Isengard now.  I think FFG has done a good job so far of finding new ways to mess with you in every cycle (can't say I always enjoy it).  Last night I played Into Fangorn for the first time and the Heart of Fangorn card had a new wrinkle I hadn't encountered before:  only being able to refresh five characters during the refresh phase.  Then there's the new Hinder keyword in this quest also."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307075-whats-a-good-winning-percentage/?do=findComment&comment=3919207","commentId":3919207,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1585160417,"content":"Reading this, and my own recent experiences, have made me realize a few things:\n\n1)  Sounds like a lot of these \"super decks\" are Vilya decks, which is interesting, since I've been running a Vilya deck myself lately.  So it's possible I could have come to this same position anyway, although I'm sure the deck I'm using if far from being optimized.\n\n2)  If your deck is going to have a high win percentage against certain quests, obviously it needs to be able to withstand early difficulties presented by the encounter deck.  Or prepared to take on a worst case scenario, because it will almost surely rear its head.  Like an enemy with too many attack points, or location lock.  I was talking before about getting a hero killed off right away ruining the game - I guess if this can happen, then the deck is simply insufficient?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307075-whats-a-good-winning-percentage/?do=findComment&comment=3919373","commentId":3919373,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1585181193,"content":"> 5 hours ago, Vince79 said:\n> \n> I was talking before about getting a hero killed off right away ruining the game - I guess if this can happen, then the deck is simply insufficient?\n\nPretty much, yes.

Along the way, I'm hoping to learn the cards, and different approaches to deck building.  This is the first card game of this type I've played, and it only drew me in because I'm a huge Tolkien fan.  I've never played another LCG or CCG.  \n\nIdeally, I'd like to do this as efficiently as I can, keeping in mind that sometimes I like to take breaks from the game.  Once I get through everything, then maybe I'll go back and think more about decks that can go through and beat a lot of quests.  Progression style, if I get through this cycle I can start using Seastan's Boromir deck, which sounds pretty powerful:\n\nhttps://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/42/seastan-s-boromir-1.0

strengths/weaknesses of a deck against particular cycles or quests.\n\n\nMy deck went 100% against Mirkwood, then 47% while clearing Dwarrowdelf (though half of those quests were still cleared in the first attempt).  It may or may not also reveal something about the relative difficulty of the two cycles, but I suspect it's possible to build a tailored deck that clears Dwarrowdelf much more readily than Mirkwood.  The takeaway, always, is that the difficulty of any given quest is hard to separate from the context of the deck(s) tackling it.  Which is why I like to view the \"strength\" of any deck I make as an aggregate of its performance against a variety of quests.  \n\nEdited March 27 by

a good example of the problem with playing blind.  I've been playing blind (don't look at the quest cards before I play it the first time).  So I'm up to Into Fangorn, and I suddenly realized there

is to forget about the stupid trees, and just quest the crap out of it.  In a lot of these quests, there's a \"light bulb moment\" where you realize what strategy that you're supposed to take.\n\nLike Wandalf said earlier, it's a huge plus to know every threat that is coming out of the encounter deck so you can act accordingly.\n\nAlso, it strikes me that the \"One Deck\" idea makes a lot more
