In your case, since all of your heroes and allies are exhausted you have no option but to take an undefended attack.\n\nAn undefended attack does not take the form of increased threat. Instead, all damage from the enemy's attack is assigned directly to one of your heroes. The hero's defence value is not considered when assigning the damage. Thematically you can think about it as if the hero was caught off guard by the attack.\n\nI second RichardPlunkett's suggestion to ready p18 of the rulebook, which describes undefended attacks.\n\nSometime it can be strategic to take an undefended attack, but usually it is wise to leave enough allies and heroes ready at the start of the combat phase to defend any attacks. Sending everyone to quest is very risky if enemies might be engaging you during the round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253375-if-i-make-all-the-heroes-and-allies-to-the-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2864988","commentId":2864988,"userName":"llmzlb","timestamp":1499126756,"content":"Now I totally get it!\n\nThank you so much!!!\n\nClears out everything!\n\nThanks\n\n(:"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253375-if-i-make-all-the-heroes-and-allies-to-the-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2864990","commentId":2864990,"userName":"llmzlb","timestamp":1499126788,"content":"> 7 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> If you have heroes, there *is* someone to take undefended attacks.  Any hero can take an undefended attack; being ready is not necessary.\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253375-if-i-make-all-the-heroes-and-allies-to-the-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2864991","commentId":2864991,"userName":"llmzlb","timestamp":1499126799,"content":"> 6 hours ago, Rouxxor said:\n> \n> If there is no defender the attack is undefended.

I've played for about a year and been doing it wrong - I've been raising my threat instead on undefended attacks!

Is there a maximium on allies/attachments that can be attached to a hero?\n\n2. Is it the normal don thing to commit all 3 heros to a quest?  (If one is left out can they still help?)\n\nWow this game seems tough - Im only on the first core adventure.

He act as a hero (except for collecting resource, deal damage on undefended attacks and some others things like cards that specifically say hero).\n\nThere is no maximum of cards in play or in hand. A hero can only have 2 restricted cards (it virtually take a hand each) but can have how many you want of attachment without this trait. Like 3 unexpected courage, 1 celebrian stone, 1 steward of gondor...\n\nYes this game is really hard. And also very interesting ;). You usually keep people for attacking, depending deck it will be allies or heroes. In multiplayer some deck will send every heroes in quest and some others none and will do the fight for the whole table."}]}
