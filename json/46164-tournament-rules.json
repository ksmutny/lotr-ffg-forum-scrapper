So you aren't competing with anyone at your table. It'd be an extremely unique play environment that way. The teams could be called \"Fellowships\" and consist of 2-4 players.  Special rewards for lowest average score, and best team work. Things like that. To me it'd foster a weekly home play group each week to tweak and practice before the league nights.\n\n \n\n "}]}
