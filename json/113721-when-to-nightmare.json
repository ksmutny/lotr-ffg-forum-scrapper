Myself and most of my playgroup have been playing since the very day LoTR LCG was first released. So, over time people have fine-tuned certain decks so well that we can easily beat a lot of scenarios. When you find yourself going into a play session already knowing that you are going to win, almost regardless of draw, etc., then it is time for nightmare mode. \n\n \n\nI absolutely hate the feeling of relative certainty about being able to beat a scenario. I want to lose. I want to lose most of the time. If that doesn't happen, the game loses its appeal for me. Nightmare Scenarios are a good way to breathe some fresh life into scenarios that are not as fun to play anymore due to them being easy. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113721-when-to-nightmare/?do=findComment&comment=1208032","commentId":1208032,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1408315029,"content":"I buy the nightmare scenarios the moment of their release (like every product in this game) but I actually don't play them much.
