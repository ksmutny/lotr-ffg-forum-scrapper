I'm glad they were smart enough to settle on JPG images, but in the older sets they give a full white border around the card. In somewhat newer sets they filled in the rounded corners with white. In Dunland Trap, they left the corners square. And now with the last two packs, they filled in the rounded corners with black. Why can't we get some consistency?\n\n \n\nPersonally, I think black rounded corners, or square corners are the best.\n\n \n\n-----\n\n \n\nAlso, what's the number for Voice of Isengard? It should be 25 but there's nothing there [http://ffgapp.com/qr/MEC25]. If you view the file names of images inside preview announcements for packs, you'll generally see MEC## in there somewhere, but Voice of Isengard doesn't have that on any of the images that I saw. What's going on there?\n\n \n\nI'm also not 100% sure how they determine some of the numbers because 32 is The Black Riders, which was released well before The Ring-Maker cycle started releasing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113327-card-image-inconsistency/?do=findComment&comment=1200492","commentId":1200492,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1408058997,"content":">  \n> \n> Look at these three links:\n> \n>  \n> \n> http://ffgapp.com/qr/MEC16 [http://ffgapp.com/qr/MEC16]\n> \n> http://ffgapp.com/qr/MEC20 [http://ffgapp.com/qr/MEC20]\n> \n> http://ffgapp.com/qr/MEC26 [http://ffgapp.com/qr/MEC26]\n> \n> http://ffgapp.com/qr/MEC28 [http://ffgapp.com/qr/MEC28]\n\n;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113327-card-image-inconsistency/?do=findComment&comment=1200656","commentId":1200656,"userName":"Vendictar","timestamp":1408067981,"content":"I am not really seeing how this is an issue.

I just have OCD and wanted to get my thoughts out there and see if anyone else is like me. I guess not :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
