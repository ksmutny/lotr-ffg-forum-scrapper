Here I decided not to go on until I managed the the unbelivable hard Dol Guldor with only the Core Cards. I tried endless times because I wouldn´t belive that it is unbeatable.\n\n \n\nThis is how I managed it:\n\n \n\nI choose Leadership, because the are the only Sphere which can handle with the low resource, because it creates more by Steaward of Gondor. Also you can handle the first part with almost every mix of the two not caught heros. And finaly it has the best joker option Seak attacking Gandalf^^. I played with 30 cards (as the Core Set are) and try to hit and quest as fast and hard as I could. What means, if starthand has no Gandalf, Sneak attack nor Steward, give up ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nI don´t know how oftend I lost. I didn´t count. But it´s for sure something like 1 out of 50^^. But now I can say: It´s not unbeatable, quite the contrary.

I've been watching some of Don Rickles's, Jeffry Ross', insult comic sort of acts lately, not a style of humor I too often watch. We all experiment with certain kinds of humor at some point, and insult comedy is a difficult one to get right. But when you think in terms of very rough-cut insult jokes, you start to see that booored is experimenting with his own material, not being a troll. Problem with that kind of humor is that if your audience doesn't know that it's a bit, it sets a very different tone.
