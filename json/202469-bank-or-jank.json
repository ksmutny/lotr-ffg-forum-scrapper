There it is clearly a benefit as assuming you're planning to Sneak-Thain a 4-6 cost ally you are breaking even (or making a profit) within one resource phase. \n\n \n\nElf-Stone, A Very Good Tale and Timely Aid also make sense, of course--as does To The Sea! now. But those all feel like they would be best used on other targets since those allies would stay on the board anyway. But in the absence of Leadership they would also work well. \n\n \n\nIf anyone's a great candidate for Sword-Thain, though, it's probably Glorfindel. And if you are Thaning him then why wouldn't you try and slap Asfaloth on him?\n\n \n\nAnd the nice thing about Noldor-Discard is that you don't feel that bad putting multiple copies of a unique card in a deck to setup a combo as they become useful as discards. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202469-bank-or-jank/?do=findComment&comment=2054583","commentId":2054583,"userName":"Bellator Sardel","timestamp":1455607845,"content":"I've been proxying ally Glorfindel in my Elrond/Gandalf deck that also contains Asfaloth and sometimes Sword-Thain.

By the fourth turn you have drawn half of your deck, and this doesn't count search effects like Master of the Forge, Galadhrim Minstrel or additional card draw via Elven-light or Daeron's Runes. Noldor combo decks are definitely viable in multiplayer because each player can include a copy of Gather Information (and remember that Silver Harp means you can keep whatever you go searching for, despite Erestor's drawback). The odds that at least one player finds their Gather Information within the first couple of rounds is very good, especially now that we have Galdor hero.\n\nEdited February 17, 2016 by danpoage"}]}
