If you don't have this adventure pack, no problem, there is a version that uses the core set only.\n\nIf you fancy respite from the depths of Khazad Dum, then this is the quest for you.\n\n\"Four Seasons\" uses 5 new cards, none of which are shuffled into the encounter deck, so its as easy as \"print and play\". If you do like to create nice new cards using photo papaer, I have provided a second jpg file with the backs of the cards, ideal for double sided printing.\n\nLike Rhosgobel, I have rated the difficulty level of this quest as 6.\n\nDownload the quest(s) here [http://www.blackmoor.org.uk/gaming.html]\n\nIf you've already played my first quest, the Temple of Melkor, why not try the updated version, recently improved following user feedback."}]}
