Do you also do a hide test? Before you start the game The card black rider reads Hide 2.\n\nShould (1.01) read all keywords and not just surge, doomed, and guarded?\n\nBeen away from the game for a few months so a little rusty on the rules but the new cards that follow the books got my excited to play again. Its so cool playing the hobbits you really get the picture that everyone is important even the lowliest of us.\n\nAnyone have a good link to a current Turn Sequence sheet?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109586-encounter-keywords-during-set-up/?do=findComment&comment=1136410","commentId":1136410,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1403951788,"content":"Hide is a keyword like many other that are triggered when revealed, the setup on black riders tell you to put it in play.
