You can find out more here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4165 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4165] In that mode your heroes do start with one resource each so that when you collect the first time you have 2 resources on each hero. It makes the game more fun while you get the hang of it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85091-resource-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=806895","commentId":806895,"userName":"Flat","timestamp":1372461836,"content":"Skogkatt said:\n\nThanks for the info and just for clarification I am a she.
