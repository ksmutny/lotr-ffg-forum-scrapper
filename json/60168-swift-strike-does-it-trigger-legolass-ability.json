Furthermore, his ability clearly states that he must participate in an attack. Since he is defending, this is not considered an attack, regardless of whether it killed an enemy or not. Defending and attacking are two completely different game actions and unless he is specifically declared as an attacker, he cannot take advantage of his ability. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60168-swift-strike-does-it-trigger-legolass-ability/?do=findComment&comment=632096","commentId":632096,"userName":"Golden_Nightingale","timestamp":1337192021,"content":"Gronw said:\n\nHi\n\nThis just came up in my game now.\n\nThe way the cards are worded, it seems to me that you would be able to use Legolas' ability, but not the Blade of Gondolin.\n\n \n\nLegolas' ability states: 'After Legolas participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, place 2 progress tokens…'\n\nBlade of Gondolin states: 'After attached hero attacks and destroys an enemy, place 1 progress token….'\n\n \n\nFor me that seems to suggest that as long as Legolas is being attacked or is attacking, then he may place the tokens while defending an enemy's attack using Swift Strike.

Legolas must be participating in an attack that destroys an enemy. Swift strike is a defensive event card and therefore progress tokens would not be placed on the quest/location. Also, Blade of Gondolin is only when participating in an attack. Legolas must be an active attacker for progress tokens to be placed on the quest. The reason Legolas's ability has the word participates  is because of his ranged ability. This way the ability has flexibility when Legolas destroys an enemy that is not engaged with that player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60168-swift-strike-does-it-trigger-legolass-ability/?do=findComment&comment=632307","commentId":632307,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1337250516,"content":" But there is no attack.  You played Swift Strike while defending."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60168-swift-strike-does-it-trigger-legolass-ability/?do=findComment&comment=632331","commentId":632331,"userName":"Scoob4","timestamp":1337253248,"content":"I think Gronw was suggesting that the enemy's attack that Legolas is defending is an attack in which Legolas is participating. I think this is stretching the literal definition of participating too far, but as I said I think that's what he was getting at. I agree, it has to be an attack the player is making for Legolas' ability to trigger."}]}
