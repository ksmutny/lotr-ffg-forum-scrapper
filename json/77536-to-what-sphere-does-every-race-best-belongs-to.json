I like the strong Lore/Leadership take the game has even though LoTR has combat as the focus (Gimli). I think the Hobbit dwarfs are less fightery (it's 30 years since I read it). I remember the Silmarillion ones being craftsmen & miners\n\nElves - All Rounders. Noldor are probably more Spirit/Leadershp & Silvan lore with both doing some Tactics - Feonor (sp?) & sons\n\nRohan - weak lore. So far the game has made them too much Spirit & not enough of Tactics & Leadership.\n\nHobbitses - Nazguhl chow - my favorite par of the Decipher game was feeding hobbits to Nazghul. They are pretty weak overall but have everything a bit & spirit most, lore hardly at all. (Merry maybe tactics, Sam leadership)\n\nGondor - not sure. Compared to elves & dwarfs weak lore so relatively strong tactics & leadership as Spirit seems to be for Rohan.\n\nDale, Beronings - no idea"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77536-to-what-sphere-does-every-race-best-belongs-to/?do=findComment&comment=749535","commentId":749535,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1358502236,"content":"Nobody mentioned EAGLES…tactics !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77536-to-what-sphere-does-every-race-best-belongs-to/?do=findComment&comment=749896","commentId":749896,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1358542707,"content":"DevastazioneH88 said:\n\nNobody mentioned EAGLES…tactics !\n\n\n\n \n\nAh! I can't believe I forgot my beloved Eagles. As far as the Dwarves go, I'm glad that they are staying true to the depiction of the Dwarves in the books, who were in general not really depicted as warriors (other than Gimli), but moreso in the Lore/Spirit realm. They do have a bit of everything so far though, which is nice. With time, hopefully the other races will be fleshed out as well."}]}
