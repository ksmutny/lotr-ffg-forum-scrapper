But when you pull the additional 2 cards for each other collateral damage in the discard pile, if another one comes up during that, do you pull another 2 cards? Is that clear?\n\nYou get CD, pull 2 cards, then see how many CD's are in the discard pile, including the first 2 cards you've already pulled, when then pulling the rest of your cards, if you pull another CD, do you pull an addional 2 cards?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96534-collateral-damage/?do=findComment&comment=949376","commentId":949376,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1389224243,"content":"Only the first copy of Collateral Damage (the one that was reveled from the Encounter Deck) has its When Revealed Effect triggered.  The whole situation is not quite as bad as you described\n\n \n\nThe wording of the card hinges on where the word \"then\" is used.\n\n \n\n\"Discard 2 cards from the top of the encounter deck. Discard an additional 2 cards for each copy of Collateral Damage in the discard pile.\"\n\n \n\nIt all happens at once, there is no if/then or \"do A then B\" effect between these two sentences.  The very first thing you do is count the number of collateral damage cards in the encounter deck discard. Don't count the one you just drew, it has not been discarded yet (plus it has already been accounted for in the first sentence of the effect). An alternate (and sort of silly) way to write the card could have been: \"count the total number of copies of collateral damage currently held in your hand and in the discard pile, then multiply by 2\"\n\n \n\nSo now X cards are discarded.  The only text that matters is the card type.  Only locations are counted.  If you see another copy of collateral damage, ignore it.  There is no ongoing effect that will force you to trigger its when revealed effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96534-collateral-damage/?do=findComment&comment=949495","commentId":949495,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1389233773,"content":"Hey, thanks!

Or does the \"Discard an additional 2 cards from the encounter deck for each copy of CD in the discard pile\" effect happen immediately, at the same time as the initial 2 discarded cards, negating any other CDs discarded from having any effect?\n\nCaleb:\n\n\"When Revealed\" effects are resolved on a sentence-by-sentence basis. When Collateral Damage is revealed, you discard the top 2 cards of your deck first. Then you discard 2 additional cards for each copy of Collateral Damage in the discard pile. Lastly you count the number of locations just discarded and raise your threat by the appropriate amount.\nIf a copy of Collateral Damage is discarded by the first sentence, then you would count that copy when resolving the second sentence.\n\nEdited January 9, 2014 by ricedwlit"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96534-collateral-damage/?do=findComment&comment=949602","commentId":949602,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1389245218,"content":"What if another copy is discarded when working out the 2nd sentence of discarding 2 cards for each one already in the pile.
