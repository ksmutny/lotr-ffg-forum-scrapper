Resolving set up on player cards..? Oh right for campaign... do you mean like the permanent boons and boons that are added to your deck?\n\nI imagine this would happen before you do the setup for the scenario like you suggest so that you can potentially draw one of the boons that get shuffled into your deck in your opening hand."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190673-nightmare-setup-timing/?do=findComment&comment=2094483","commentId":2094483,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1457627154,"content":">  \n> \n> > Pretty positive you do the setup for 1A first then the nightmare set up and the Assault on Osgiliath example is an oversight/mistake.

I am just about to play Nightmare Dead Marshes and the instruction to put the Mere of Dead Faces into play is on the nightmare card. Having this follow the setup in 1A is strange because it might be revealed by 1A or discarded in an Escape test. Also it would not place an initial 2 resources on Gollum."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190673-nightmare-setup-timing/?do=findComment&comment=2094706","commentId":2094706,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1457632468,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > Pretty positive you do the setup for 1A first then the nightmare set up and the Assault on Osgiliath example is an oversight/mistake.
