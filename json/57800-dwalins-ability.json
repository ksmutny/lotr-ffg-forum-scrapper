Becuase even if you use say Legolas to participate in the attack, Dwalin has still initiated it to it is his attack. Also think the reason they talk about powering him up is so that he can kill some of the bigger enemies and not just titichy little orcs :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57800-dwalins-ability/?do=findComment&comment=569387","commentId":569387,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1324307964,"content":"yeah i dont think it matters either"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57800-dwalins-ability/?do=findComment&comment=569435","commentId":569435,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1324315860,"content":"it is almost the exact wording from legolas... so the efect would be the same."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57800-dwalins-ability/?do=findComment&comment=569448","commentId":569448,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1324317291,"content":"Legolas and Dwalin attacking together and killing an orc.

Then you get 3 progress and 2 threat reduction. Awesome.\n\nLegolas is ranged too, so you could play them from separate decks in 2-player: one Dwarf, one Elf deck...the Last Alliance of Dwarves and Elves. \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57800-dwalins-ability/?do=findComment&comment=569711","commentId":569711,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1324378159,"content":"also i think that some quests in the new cycle/khazad will perhaps benefit from dwalins threat reduction, i see some bad treachery cards ahead"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57800-dwalins-ability/?do=findComment&comment=569795","commentId":569795,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1324388416,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nalso i think that some quests in the new cycle/khazad will perhaps benefit from dwalins threat reduction, i see some bad treachery cards ahead\n\n\n\nAnd it sounds like those bad treachery cards include swarming of the enemy, so might need every hero and ally possible!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57800-dwalins-ability/?do=findComment&comment=654607","commentId":654607,"userName":"ruchlas","timestamp":1341580181,"content":"Sorry to bring it up after 7 months,but don't you guys think Dwalin Legolas and Brand should have the same expression if they could trigger their effect either by attacking alone or with help?
