Two Mounts seem like a glitch to me, but counting the \"Restricted\" attatchments everything seems to be in order. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nAlso assume,  I do have a Eagles of the Misty Mountains with e.g. 3 face down attchments.\n\n \n\nIf I am right the following sequence seems allright:\n\n- exaust SotE, so Legolas gets +5 axes (to a total of 9 with Firefoot)\n\n- declare Legolas and EotMM itself as a attacker, which means they both strike with a total of 14\n\n- that 13 damage will kill something for sure, so put two tokens on the quest and exaust Rohan Warhorse to ready Legolas\n\n- now atack with Legolas alone,it's still 9 damage probably able to kill two enemys with an exausted Firefoot\n\n- another two counters on the active quest (to bad it reads at Legolas: per attack, not per killed enemy.. )\n\n \n\nA Mighty Prowess could add two single damge more...\n\n \n\nDo I miss something? This seems to be insane! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n---------\n\nE o.t.M.M\n\nEagles of the Misty Mountains cannot have restricted attachments. Eagles of the Misty Mountains gets +1 [Attack] and +1 [Defense] for each facedown attachment it has.\nResponse: After another Eagle character leaves play, you may attach that card facedown to Eagles of the Misty Mountains.\n\n \n\nSupport of the Eagles reads:\n\n\"Action: Exhaust Support of the Eagles to choose an Eagle ally. Until the end of the phase, attached hero adds that ally's [Attack] or [Defense] (choose 1) to its own.\"\n\n \n\nRohan Warehorse\n\n\"Attach to a [Tactics] or Rohan hero. Restricted.\nResponse: After attached hero participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, exhaust Rohan Warhorse to ready attached hero.\"\n\n \n\nFire Foot:\n\n\"Attach to a [Tactic] or Rohan hero. Restricted.\nAttached hero gets +1 [Attack] (+2 [Defense] instead if attached hero is Éomer).\nResponse: After attached hero attacks alone, exhaust Firefoot to choose a non-unique enemy engaged with you. Excess damage dealt by this attack is assigned to the chosen enemy.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135485-support-of-the-eagles/?do=findComment&comment=1457578","commentId":1457578,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1424455947,"content":"That's all legit.  It's very strong, but also takes a loooong time to setup.  You're looking at 4 cards costing 10 resources plus the cost of the eagles that are under EotMM."}]}
