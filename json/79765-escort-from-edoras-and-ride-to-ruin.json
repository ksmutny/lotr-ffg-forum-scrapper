If a character leaves play before quest resolution, its willpower won't be counted. So you cannot use Escort like you did. You can ether discard her for progress or use its willpower."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79765-escort-from-edoras-and-ride-to-ruin/?do=findComment&comment=766746","commentId":766746,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1361731071,"content":"Hmm.
