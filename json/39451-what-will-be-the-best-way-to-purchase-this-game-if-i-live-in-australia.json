Currently the Ozzie dollar is at near parity with the US dollar so, should I buy it from the US and ship it here or wait and buy it in Oz?\n\nUS price will probably be half of Ozzie price but I will need to add postage which will probably even things out!\n\nI also have no idea of how far behind the US release date it will appear on Ozzie shores and then I need to consider the inevitable monthly expansions and how I also get them.\n\nSo does anybody know if you can sign up in advance for ongoing delivery of initial release and subsequent expansions like a subscription service that will offer discounts?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nFatboy Chubby\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39451-what-will-be-the-best-way-to-purchase-this-game-if-i-live-in-australia/?do=findComment&comment=397523","commentId":397523,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1292665459,"content":"I have all of my LCG's on constant order at my FLGS he brings in them all for me as his distributor has him on standing order as well. I am sure any store would be happy to set that up. Also having recently sold some stuff on ebay and shipped it to Australia(which I knew where it was long before Oprah I am sure) its very expensive to ship down there and very slow if you don't use air mail which is crazy expensive. Now keep in mind I am in Canada so it might be less to ship from US as its closer, not by much though. Really I would say support your local store and buy local. Less hassle involved and less waiting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39451-what-will-be-the-best-way-to-purchase-this-game-if-i-live-in-australia/?do=findComment&comment=402041","commentId":402041,"userName":"SubElement","timestamp":1293921031,"content":"I personally like http://www.gamesparadise.com.au [http://www.gamesparadise.com.au]\n\nOther than that, I agree, support your local gaming store!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39451-what-will-be-the-best-way-to-purchase-this-game-if-i-live-in-australia/?do=findComment&comment=409995","commentId":409995,"userName":"The_Grognard","timestamp":1295310915,"content":"(edit: info obsolete)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEdited September 1, 2017 by The_Grognard\ninfo obsolete"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39451-what-will-be-the-best-way-to-purchase-this-game-if-i-live-in-australia/?do=findComment&comment=425199","commentId":425199,"userName":"Madboyo","timestamp":1297850974,"content":"Milsims Games would also be a good bet. www.milsims.com.au/ [http://www.milsims.com.au/] .
