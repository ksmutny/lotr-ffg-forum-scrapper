This means I have to stand by my promise and give everyone something special, so here it is.\n\nVision of the Palantir is proud to present a full printable strategy guide on the first 2 cycles of the game, including art work, statistics, and jokes!\n\nThe file can be downloaded as PDF from this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hbxfm2sfpwakhvw/Vision of the Palantir Guide Volume 1 - The Early Days.pdf?dl=0 [https://www.dropbox.com/s/hbxfm2sfpwakhvw/Vision%20of%20the%20Palantir%20Guide%20Volume%201%20-%20The%20Early%20Days.pdf?dl=0]\n\nThe file is quite big if you are looking to print it, with 139 pages and most featuring colored images. But it is great to have a physical book where you can read all about the strategy on the scenarios of the first 2 cycles.\n\nMore of these bundles will be made public as the blog and the Patreon page reach new milestones. I also need some time to prepare the next set, but Volume 2 has all scenarios covered already, so we should be able to produce that one relatively quickly.\n\nI hope this helps some people in having a physical (or at least offline) resource to fall back to. Thanks for the great support and we will do our best to keep up the good work.\n\nOn a side-note here, I will be having some real life getting in the way of blogging for the next 6 months (graduation stuff), so I will have to tone down the frequency of content. But I'm sure that my co-authors will be filling in some gaps. If there is anyone willing to cover a scenario that hasn't been covered yet, feel free to reach out, and I'll get you started as an author.\n\nGood luck with your games,\n\n \n\nDurins_Father\n\n \n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293493-downloadable-strategy-guide-for-first-2-cycles/?do=findComment&comment=3672884","commentId":3672884,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1554838097,"content":"This is really cool!\n\nI'm going to print those for sure!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293493-downloadable-strategy-guide-for-first-2-cycles/?do=findComment&comment=3673148","commentId":3673148,"userName":"DMG","timestamp":1554851838,"content":"I've only had the chance to take a quick skim through & it looks great!  Nice work Durins_Father."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293493-downloadable-strategy-guide-for-first-2-cycles/?do=findComment&comment=3673540","commentId":3673540,"userName":"mrtoadz","timestamp":1554902497,"content":"Thank you very much for the guide!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293493-downloadable-strategy-guide-for-first-2-cycles/?do=findComment&comment=3674095","commentId":3674095,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1554927275,"content":"Great read thank you!"}]}
