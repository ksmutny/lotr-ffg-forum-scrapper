The closest thing that I found was the way they wrote out the Turn Sequence.

Once each player has had the opportunity to play and passed, the planning phase ends. If someone plays Follow Me! it does not grant extra opportunities to play allies and attachments. Play continues to proceed clockwise until each player has had their opportunity. If you take control of the first player token after you had your opportunity to play cards, play will automatically proceed through player order until it reaches a player who has not passed. Once all players have had their opportunity and passed, the phase ends.
