I have two first cycles complete, both hobbit boxes and first two sagas. Scenarios i enjoyed the most were dwarrowelf cycle and the worst were the hobbit ones. Sadly i'm not a fan of dwarf decks and most of what i have support this playstyle. I can only buy one big box. My choices are:\n\n>Get treason of saruman and continue with the saga.\n\n>Get wilds of rhovanion because i enjoy dale theme.\n\n>Get heirs of numenor and continue with relase order. \n\nHelp me decide guys. I like playing solo. I'm eventually planning to get more but one bog box is what i can get atm."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280522-looking-for-purchase-suggestion/?do=findComment&comment=3431508","commentId":3431508,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1533594889,"content":"Heirs will probably disappoint you because of the challenge level and how some of the mechanics invalidate a good deal of your card pool (thinking of Battle and Siege questing).\n\nWilds is a solid purchase and you basically get a new, immediately playable deck archetype in the box.  The characters are not so iconic, but if you enjoy delving into the relatively unexplored peoples of Middle-Earth, this is a good one.  You would probably be pretty satisfied with your purchase.   It's also going to be the easiest one to find, as many older boxes only come into print occasionally. \n\nTreason is a very solid box with great quests and play cards alike.  If you're enjoying the campaign, it's a good buy.  You also get a hero who opens up the Rohan archetype in a very big way, as well as a couple of other cards which support Rohan in general.  You have some Rohan cards, based on what you wrote, although not any of the newer stuff.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280522-looking-for-purchase-suggestion/?do=findComment&comment=3431531","commentId":3431531,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1533595908,"content":"I'd go with either Treason of Saruman (if you like Rohan) or Wilds of Rhovannion (if you like Dale).

If you plan on playing/buying progression style, go with Heirs. This probably isn't the best idea, because you'll face stocking issues, difficulty, and not be up-to-date with the community.\n\nYou could go with Treason of Saruman if you really love the source material, and pick up some other expansions later.\n\nIf I were you I'd go for Wilds, even though I've doomed myself to option A.

When I go back and play some earlier quests they can be easier, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I find beating a quest quickly is the best way to get less play out of it. \n\nThat's my preference anyhow. \n\n \n\nThe wilds is awesome card wise because you get basically an incredible deck archetype in the box, that is super fun and can be powerful.
