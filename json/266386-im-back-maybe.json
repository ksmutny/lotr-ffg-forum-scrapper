Welcome to the club of people that are too busy to be playing the game, but do anyway!\n\nMy personal opinion on your question is that Dream-chaser has better player cards but Haradrim has better quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/266386-im-back-maybe/?do=findComment&comment=3146850","commentId":3146850,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1514563801,"content":"The Dream-chaser cycle had a wonderful variety of unique scenarios though. You get involved in a chase at sea, explore an uncharted island and literally create a board game out of Location cards while doing so, and you take part in a naval battle... it’s a very memorable cycle.  The Haradrim cycle has been good so far and the quests are probably more challenging on average, but I suspect in the long run they may leave less of an impression on the collective memory.\n\nEdited December 29, 2017 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/266386-im-back-maybe/?do=findComment&comment=3147067","commentId":3147067,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1514572763,"content":"I'd concur with the dream chaser cycle.  The quests are good, but the player cards are excellent.  Elfhelm, Lanwyn, armored destrier(!), Windfola.\n\nAlso, unrelated question.  Do you play forum mafia at all?
