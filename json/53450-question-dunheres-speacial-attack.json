It's allowed for player actions right after this.\n\nJust wanna be sure exactly how this works as I think it's really unclear. Nothing on the card says it can only be used in the attack fase, I only discovered that in the unofficial FAQ. And now it might only be specific after the enemy attact is resolved?

(I think someone already mentioned this in the forums some time ago in another thread, but I can't remember who or where). It doesn't mean that he can attack in another phase. Dunhere is attacking after all enemies have attacked, just like all other of your characters do. This is because his attack cannot be used as an action (the bold action-trigger is missing)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53450-question-dunheres-speacial-attack/?do=findComment&comment=530989","commentId":530989,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1316576942,"content":"Ah, okay.
