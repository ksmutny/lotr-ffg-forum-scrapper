For the rest it seems correct to me.\n\n> 15 hours ago, player3944183 said:\n> \n> or\n> \n> 1. quest,\n> 2. successful (add to smaug - still under 6)\n> 3. burgle attempt\n> 4. success, optionally go to 3b\n> 5. resolve questing\n> 6. add progress tokens as normal to 3b\n\nThis is correct."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292808-hobbit-saga-lonely-mountain-advancing-stages-2b-3b-4b-help/?do=findComment&comment=3658032","commentId":3658032,"userName":"player3944183","timestamp":1553613277,"content":"deleted..\n\nEdited March 26, 2019 by player3944183"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292808-hobbit-saga-lonely-mountain-advancing-stages-2b-3b-4b-help/?do=findComment&comment=3658033","commentId":3658033,"userName":"player3944183","timestamp":1553613339,"content":"> 32 minutes ago, Alonewolf87 said:\n> \n> Yes you change quest before placing the progress (the \"determine if questing successfully\" and \"placing progress tokens\" are two separate steps).\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> Just one detail, since you switched to Stage 4b you cannot make the burgle attemp, since it was Stage 2b (that is not in play at that moment) that instructed you to do so).
