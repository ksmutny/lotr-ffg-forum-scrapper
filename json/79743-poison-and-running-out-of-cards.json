Her deck had some pretty decent card draw mechanics plus the Poison cards made her go through it extra fast. About halfway through the game she had run through her entire deck. What happens then in regards to taking Poison. Were her characters then immune to further Poison attachments as she had no more cards to put under them? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79743-poison-and-running-out-of-cards/?do=findComment&comment=769323","commentId":769323,"userName":"OuterSpace_Mushroom","timestamp":1362246095,"content":"I think when your deck runs out of cards you are D E A D, dead my friend."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79743-poison-and-running-out-of-cards/?do=findComment&comment=769390","commentId":769390,"userName":"hildargo","timestamp":1362265457,"content":"It's interesting that they didn't address in the FAQ, but other areas of On the Doorstep were addressed. Firstly, if you get decked, you don't die. In fact, I believe that the rules state the opposite. Secondly, I don't believe that you would put any poison counters on a player, but I am not entirely sure. I played a multiplayer game today, and one of the players ran out of cards for poison counters, so that was the consensus we all came to."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79743-poison-and-running-out-of-cards/?do=findComment&comment=770407","commentId":770407,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1362510066,"content":"Just got an official response, even though we already came to this conclusion:\n\nIf you run out of cards in your deck when the Venom keyword triggers, then there are no cards to attach as Poison and nothing happens.\nCheers,\nCaleb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79743-poison-and-running-out-of-cards/?do=findComment&comment=770471","commentId":770471,"userName":"Bray","timestamp":1362519077,"content":"Kirok said:\n\nI think when your deck runs out of cards you are D E A D, dead my friend.\n\nIn case any new players are reading this thread, note that this is not correct at all.\n\n \n\n "}]}
