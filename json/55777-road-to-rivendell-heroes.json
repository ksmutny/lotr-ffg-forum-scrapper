On Magali Villeneuve's site, she put the full picture up and it has the title, El-MagaliVilleneuve.jpg. So we know it's one of them, she was clever enough not to give away exactly who though! My guess is that it's Elladan. I say that because Elrohir means Elf-rider and I'm hoping FFG will really show their awesomeness and put Elrohir on a horse for his picture. That being said, Elladan does have two L's and she only put one in the title so it may be Elrohir after all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55777-road-to-rivendell-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=552237","commentId":552237,"userName":"Shiv@n","timestamp":1320503040,"content":"Couldn't it be Elrond himself ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55777-road-to-rivendell-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=552375","commentId":552375,"userName":"gamestar10","timestamp":1320529819,"content":"Personally, I won't expect Elrond as a character card until the 3rd Adventure Pack at least."}]}
