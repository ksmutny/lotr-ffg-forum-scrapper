Or does the sorcery keyword only affect him when revealed during questing?\n\nEdited December 21, 2016 by Kako K."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/237545-thaurdir-and-sorcery/?do=findComment&comment=2553146","commentId":2553146,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1482320499,"content":"When you reveal a shadow card, you ignore all of it apart from the shadow effect.\n\nUnless there is an effect in play which explicitly contradicts this - for example the Witch of Angmar in The Dread Realm has an effect which triggers if her shadow card(s) have the Sorcery trait. However no such exception is present in Battle of Carn Dum, so you follow the general principle - only the shadow effect matters, so Thaurdir doesn't trigger."}]}
