My Tactics / Spirit deck is Eowyn, Legolas, and Thalin - a starting threat of 27. My Leadership/Lore deck is Aragorn, Theodred, and Glorfindel. That's a whopping starting threat of 32 but, what the heck, it's only a game, right?\n\n \n\nEverything's shuffled, I'm all set to go, so I start this game like every previous game, with the Setup:\n\n \n\n\"Reveal 1 card per player from the encounter deck, and add it to the staging area\".\n\n \n\nAs a sign of things to come, the first card is \"Old Wives' Tales\":\n\n \n\n\"When Revealed: Discard 1 resource from each hero's resource pool, if able. Exhaust any hero that could not discard a resource from its pool.\"\n\n \n\nSince this is Setup, I have no resources so all 6 heroes are exhausted.\n\n \n\nThe second card is \"Signs of Gollum\", which seems like a good thing as it's a needed Clue.  It's \"Guarded\" so I then deal another encounter card for it, which is \"The West Bank\", a 3 threat location.\n\n \n\nI don't remember my starting hands exactly, but I drew only 2 allies - Snowbourn Scout and Gondorian Spearman, neither of which have any willpower.  Things could be better, but I get my allies on the table and get 1 progress token on the location when Snowbourn Scout enters.\n\n \n\nOf course, I have no ready heroes and no allies who can quest so I resign myself to taking a first-turn quest-phase threat hit.  And that's when the full fury of this game shows itself.\n\n \n\nThe first revealed encounter card is \"Eastern Crows\".  Only 1 threat, but it surges.  The next card is, you guessed it, another \"Eastern Crows\".  Another 1 threat, another surge.  The next card is \"Hunters From Mordor\", only 2 threat but because there's a Clue in the Staging area it gets +2 threat, for a total of 4. And I still have another encounter card to draw.\n\n \n\nI take a deep breath and reveal...\"Goblintown Scavengers\".  It only has 1 threat but it's \"When Revealed\" effect is a doozy that I have no way to cancel:\n\n \n\n\"When Revealed: Discard the top card of each player's deck. Until the end of the phase, increase Goblintown Scavenger's Threat by the total printed cost of all cards discarded in this way.\"\n\n \n\nI don't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\n \n\nMy Tactics / Spirit deck draw is another Gondorian Spearman - 2 cost, so 2 threat.\n\n \n\nMy Leadership / Lore deck draw is Faramir.  4 cost, 4 ****ing threat.\n\n \n\nI decide to laugh.\n\n \n\nTurn 1 Total Staging Area Threat is 16:\n\n\"The West Bank\" - 3\n\n\"Eastern Crows\" - 1\n\n\"Eastern Crows\" - 1\n\n\"Hunters From Mordor\" - 2 (+2 for the Clue card)\n\n\"Goblintown Scavenger\" - 1 (+2, +4 from player deck discard boosts)\n\n \n\nAs you'll recall my heroes are completely exhausted from all the \"Old Wives' Tales\" gossip, so Turn 1 Total Questing Willpower is 0.\n\n \n\nPlayer 1 threat increases from 32 to 48.  Player 2 threat increases from 27 to 43.  After less than 1 turn.\n\n \n\nI was so amused at this point that I went ahead and played it out.  I somehow managed to get to Quest stage 2B before the inevitable Threat-Out.\n\n \n\nI'm hopeful that sharing my misfortune will provide some amusement to you, some catharsis for me, and maybe score me some karma points. This game can be a real jerk sometimes.   :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134536-quest-recap-the-hunt-for-gollum-epic-fail/?do=findComment&comment=1442696","commentId":1442696,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1423541778,"content":"I love those jaw-dropping moments.  Especially when they come from seemingly innocuous quests.  I have been wiped by the shadow effect on Hummerhorns while doing Passage through Mirkwood a couple of times.\n\n \n\nChalk it up to fate, reshuffle and have another go!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134536-quest-recap-the-hunt-for-gollum-epic-fail/?do=findComment&comment=1442754","commentId":1442754,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1423547876,"content":"I've had some moments like this.
