To me the only thing is he finish the game and don't win so even if it is not written on a card he have lost the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270842-encounter-at-amon-din/?do=findComment&comment=3236442","commentId":3236442,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1520091209,"content":"The quest has explicit win conditions, they were not met.  The quest has explicit loss conditions, they were not met either.  The core rule book has player elimination criteria (auto loss), they were also not met.  The quest was neither won nor lost, merely completed.  If a label must be applied to that state, the long-established game outcome known as a \"tie\" would seem to apply best. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270842-encounter-at-amon-din/?do=findComment&comment=3236907","commentId":3236907,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1520126608,"content":"I would say, in case of a \"tie,\" the quest has been completed, you have decidedly not won, therefore you have lost."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270842-encounter-at-amon-din/?do=findComment&comment=3237525","commentId":3237525,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1520193461,"content":"This conversation is very technical but I'd say that there's no \"tie\" possible against or Sauron.

The quest itself lays out explicit win *and* loss conditions related to saving villagers, so absent errata a player cannot lose from tied villagers *by rule*.\n\nSince it's a cooperative game, players are certainly free to consider a de jure non-win, non-loss to be a de facto loss.  A similar situation occurs in the online solo Legendary leagues -- there are explicit win and loss conditions, and it's possible for the game to end without either being met.  For league purposes, the scoring only considers wins, so a \"tie\" is effectively a de facto loss.\n\nThematically, if my goal is to save more villagers than were destroyed, and the orcs goal is to destroy more villagers than were saved, I think it's entirely appropriate to consider a tie a tie -- I didn't meet my goal, but I at least thwarted the forces of evil from achieving their goal, and that's worth something.\n\nEdited March 5, 2018 by dalestephenson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270842-encounter-at-amon-din/?do=findComment&comment=3239214","commentId":3239214,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1520287885,"content":"Got a response back from Caleb...\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Hi Mike,\n> If the number of tokens on Rescued Villagers is the same as Dead Villagers, then you have neither won nor lost.

They may have very few cards, awful restriction (only gondor card with no e inside for example :p) or simply don't want to go to deep in deckbuilding. But yes the scenario is one of the easiest scenario of the game. And the nightmare is to me the 5th hardest scenario to me (and could be upgraded to 3th place right after Dol Guldur NM and battle of the five armies NM, since both mount doom and black gate open are a little bit too special to be rated). He is definitely the scenario who earn the most with his nightmare version. I am happy that someone know this too, I sometime felt alone to hard test those NM ^^."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270842-encounter-at-amon-din/?do=findComment&comment=3244857","commentId":3244857,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1520703614,"content":"> On 3/7/2018 at 3:40 PM, Rouxxor said:\n> \n> Don't tell them it is too easy.
