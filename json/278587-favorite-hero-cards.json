I found many people who don't know the errata (and at this point we forget to explain them what have change: in the latest FAQ Boromir can only ready once per phase) and few who express the need to explain to the others what they should play.

I'm tempted to say the artwork rivals that of the really good MTG cards.\n\n- Second, Spirit Glorfindel is pretty straightforward to use. Slap on Light of Valinor on him and you can quest and attack every round. Simple. I like simple. He also starts out with very low threat to give you time to find Light of Valinor in the early rounds.\n\n- Third reason is because he was shunned in the movie trilogy. Like seriously, Glorfindel was a bad-*** in the books, but you wouldn't know if you only watched the movies. If my memory serves me right, aside from Gandalf, Glorfindel is the only other character/hero I know, that has taken on and defeated a Balrog.

He seems to be an even bigger hero than Glorfindel, except looks like he wasn't reincarnated like Glorfindel and Gandalf were. Glorfindel was mentioned in the first LOTR book, but I don't remember reading about Ecthelion, but in my defense, it has been a decade since I last read the books. So the three of them died battling Balrogs, I wonder why that is.\n\nIt would be cool if there were Ecthelion hero/ally cards, but as it is, the only Ecthelion card I could find is a treachery card.
