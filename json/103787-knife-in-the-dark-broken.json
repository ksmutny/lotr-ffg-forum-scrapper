Why? Well Bill Ferny isn't that annoying anymore. The Westfold Outrider makes it quite easy to take him out from staging after which killing him is no problem at all. Since he isn't that kind of a striking enemy. \n\nPrevious to the VoI you always had a challenge of getting him out quickly. His 5 hp are great since 1 Gandalf isnt enough to kill him. And you always need some combinations of cards to get him out.\n\nI really hope that I'm not the only one who thinks this quest lost the true challenge that lay within it. \n\n \n\nJban"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103787-knife-in-the-dark-broken/?do=findComment&comment=1047832","commentId":1047832,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1397402707,"content":"Let me clarify it a little.\n\n \n\nThe real challenge to me was always to get Bill out soon and be able to adapt to the mega-Nazgul fight at the end.
