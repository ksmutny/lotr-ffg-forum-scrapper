After failing miserably time after time I decidedÂ  I will instead focus on Land of Sorrow because 1) it's much easier ðŸ˜„Â and 2) to give potential readers a brief feel of the quest. So ... I've played this quest 5 times, now. Twice I've won, twice I've lost. Below is my 5th try.\n\nÂ \n\nForth, the Three Hunters! (Gandalf, Tactics Eowyn, Spirit Glorfindel)\n\n51 cards deck, starting threat 25\n\nInitial draw: 2x Unexpected Courage, Dagger of Westernesse, Gondorian Shield, Golden Shield, A Test of Will\n\nMulligan: Feint, Shadowfax, Light of Valinor, Herugrim, Golden Belt, The Galadhrim's Greeting\n\nÂ \n\nSetup: Add eachÂ CampÂ location to the staging area. Attach a randomÂ CaptiveÂ objective-ally to eachÂ CampÂ location as a guarded objective. Place one randomÂ WardenÂ enemy faceup (but not in play) under eachÂ CampÂ location. Shuffle the encounter deck and discard cards from the top until X locations are discarded, where X is 1 less than the number of players. Add each location discarded this way to the staging area.\n\nÂ \n\n1B (15 QP)\n\nEachÂ CampÂ location is immune to player card effects, and players cannot travel there while aÂ WardenÂ enemy is in play.Â \n\nForced:Â At the end of the round, raise each player's threat by 1 for eachÂ CampÂ location in the staging area.\n\nÂ \n\nYou can't defeat this stage unless you control all three objective-allies.\n\nÂ \n\nTurn 1\n\nRP: Draws Strider (reveals Snowmane)\n\nPP: Snowmane (from the top), Golden Belt, Strider on Eowyn (6 WP now), Light of Valinor on Glorfindel\n\nQP: Staging area: Slave Quarters (1), The Storehouse (1), The Barracks (1)\n\nEowyn and Glorfindel quest for 9 WP\n\nReveals Working Fields (3) - While Working Fields is in the staging area, characters cannot be healed. Travel: Each players deals 1 damage to a character he controls.\n\n9 WP vs 6 threatÂ = 3 progress on main quest\n\nTP: I decided to travel to The Barracks (5 quest points, Forced: After The Barracks becomes the active location, add the enemy under it to the staging area. That enemy cannot take damage this round. Forced: When the Barracks is explored, the first player gains control of the objective ally it was guarding.) because the forced effect was not as harsh as the effects on the other two Camp locations. TheÂ enemy I added to staging area was Ulwarth (3 threat, 4A, 1D and 6H). The guarded captive underneath The Barracks was Silvan Endrahil with responseÂ After Edrahil quests successfully, choose a player to draw 1 card.\n\nEP: DecidesÂ not to engage Ulwarth (his engagement cost is 34). This made me sweat for a few rounds.\n\nRP: because of the forced effect on the quest card, threat raised by 3 (28)\n\nÂ \n\nTurn 2\n\nRP: Draws Galadhrim's GreetingÂ (revealsÂ Wizard Pipe)\n\nPP: Wizard Pipe (from the top) on Gandalf\n\nQP: Staging Area:Â Slave Quarters (1), The Storehouse (1), Working Fields (3), Ulwarth (3)\n\nEowyn and Glorfindel quest for 9 WP\n\nReveals Watch Tower (X) - While Watch Tower is in the staging area, it gains archery X.

MVP was Dunedain Remedy, one turn saw it heal like 30 damage between all 4 decks).\n\nHard but satisfying quest, less punishing than Under the Ash Mountains since it's more traditional in the difficulties you have to overcome. We were constantly at the edge of defeat but prevailed with a good strategy and a little luck. Dang if they are annoying those Wardens.\n\nNow onto Escape from Khazad-Dum before we have to change our decks for The Fortress of Nurn.\n\nEdited November 7 by Alonewolf87"}]}
