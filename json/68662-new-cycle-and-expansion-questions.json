Both CoC, aGoT and W:I are LCG's but with slightly different ways to release cards. All have \"monthly\" AP's of cause, but other than that they don't have the same way of releasing expansions or big box sets. W:I for instant, they have 3 big boxes and 6 cycles. AGoT have 8 big boxes and 8 cycles. CoC have 3 big boxes (incl. the new one to be released) and 7 cycles. So the fact that FFG now releases two big boxes for LotR doesn't mean or say squat.
