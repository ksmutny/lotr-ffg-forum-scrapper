At start, both players draw their hand. I noticed\n\nthat one player decided to use the mulligan ruling. Whoa! Wait a minute here...\n\nThis player only discarded 3 cards and drew 3 new cards.  No way!  Did he just\n\npull a fast one.. with the other player not catching it...? :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]\n\n \n\nOk, I didn't say anything for I didn't know the clarity of the mulligan rule. :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]\n\n \n\n(*) My gaming instincts tell me... if I do a mulligan on my first draw of the cards for\n\nmy hand... I am to discard the full hand. Not a selected few! (*) :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]\n\n \n\nWell... hmm... now, what if both players agreed amongst themselves already\n\nthat it can be for certain amount of cards and not just the whole hand?\n\n \n\nThen again... if it's a \"regulation / tournament\" game... I must go with my original\n\ngaming instinct (*) .\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106891-mulligan-issue/?do=findComment&comment=1094140","commentId":1094140,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1400756416,"content":"Your friend is a totally cheater.
