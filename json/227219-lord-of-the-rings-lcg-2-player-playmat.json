I am wondering if there has been any word on whether FFG is developing a 2 player playmat for LOTR, or should I just try and have a custom playmat made? I'd really prefer one from FFG, since I am such a fan of the other playmats, but if it's not going to happen I might as well figure something else out. Any advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227219-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-2-player-playmat/?do=findComment&comment=2388860","commentId":2388860,"userName":"Ryandb2","timestamp":1472411093,"content":"I haven't heard anything, but recently printed this one http://files.geekdo.com/geekfile_download.php?filetype=image%2Fjpeg&filename=2+players+playmatENG.jpg&filecode=p6qtg9mx0o&validationcode=f7eb631050ed3de7fa2ac5de79ae31ae [http://files.geekdo.com/geekfile_download.php?filetype=image%2Fjpeg&filename=2+players+playmatENG.jpg&filecode=p6qtg9mx0o&validationcode=f7eb631050ed3de7fa2ac5de79ae31ae]through inked gaming (it's the top one in BGG). I can't imagine FFG doing better, especially guven the ones they give out events (which are beautiful and well made but don't help organize play). It is amazing, though it was about $40."}]}
