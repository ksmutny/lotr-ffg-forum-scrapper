I know it's pricey but I had it on Helm's Deep Solo the other day and since I was questing successfully each round it remained and allowed me to go 5/8 rounds without ever having to exhaust my heroes. Considering my heroes were Elrond, Gandalf and Treebeard those are pretty good heroes to not have to exhaust to do anything. (It's also free when you vilya it into play, thanks Elrond!).\n\nI also had a lot of fun with it on Journey to the Crossroads just now as it made me go from a defensive slowly losing battle to a powerful counterattack round where I wiped out 6 Harad enemies in one go with my not exhausting heroes. It combos really well with the above named Elrond/Gandalf/Treebeard deck but also with Henamarth Riversong so you always no how much to quest with to keep the active location in play and maximize Path of Need. \n\nI can see how this card would be harder to utilize in anything beyond Solo but in Solo it's become my new favorite card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292692-path-of-need-is-amazing-on-helms-deep/?do=findComment&comment=3655990","commentId":3655990,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1553419600,"content":"> 12 hours ago, GILLIES291 said:\n> \n> my heroes were Elrond, Gandalf and Treebeard\n\nOkay.

How did you not threat out?\n\nThree things, Favor of the Valar, Elrond's Counsel x3, and the final hardcore combo of The Fall of Gil-Galad combined with the retrieval Fortune or Fate/Landroval. Letting Treebeard soak enough archery that he dies and drops your threat by 13 only to be brought back same round is a great way to drop your threat down into as low as the high 20s. It's always a risky game with those three but as long as I get one of those in play early, or ally Elfhelm, it helps me against the Doomed. \n\nThen you just have to keep an eye on it and enjoy playing with three of the strongest heroes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292692-path-of-need-is-amazing-on-helms-deep/?do=findComment&comment=3656709","commentId":3656709,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1553497319,"content":"> 17 hours ago, GILLIES291 said:\n> \n> Three things, Favor of the Valar, Elrond's Counsel x3, and the final hardcore combo of The Fall of Gil-Galad combined with the retrieval Fortune or Fate/Landroval.
