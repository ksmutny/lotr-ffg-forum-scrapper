Secrecy decks, especially in solo are often light on combat.. so stopping some of those \"engage no matter what\" type low threat enemy cards is still powerful, but yeah.. it is sorta trying to trick you into thinking it is better than it is, though I think if you are failing secrecy stopping a scary engagement isn't a bad idea.. spesh if your deck has weak combat, and it also gives you a turn and a resource round to get secrecy back.\n\n\n\n> we still haven't seen any made up female heroes in Leadership OR Tactics.

You can still kill them off yourself\n\n- Risk Some Light: keep these enemies from ever showing up\n\n- O Elbereth! Gilthonial!: chump block with an ally and then just send it away. The requirement to block probably makes this card kinda suck for this\n\n- Out of the Wild: Same theory as Risk Some Light, except more permanent removal\n\n- Hobbit-Sense: You can't get attacked, like Out of Sight.\n\n- Take No Notice: Don't let them engage\n\n- Advance Warning: Pretty limited because it's practically impossible to build a secrecy deck with all Lore, but Pippin + Mirlonde + one of a few other heroes will at least get you started below the threshold.\n\n- Spirit Pippin: Everyone hates him, but his ability works just fine for this with enough threat reduction.\n\n- A Light in the Dark: been around for quite a while and is much more affordable with Leaf Brooch.\n\nEdited February 6, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98421-a-new-priview-is-up/?do=findComment&comment=977308","commentId":977308,"userName":"13thcaesar","timestamp":1391802635,"content":"1fb2aebf130655a69647961726abe37b-d7570w5 [http://th05.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2014/036/1/f/1fb2aebf130655a69647961726abe37b-d7570w5.jpg]\n\n \n\nShe's name probably is Idraen.\n\n'A hardened female ranger of the Dunedain!
