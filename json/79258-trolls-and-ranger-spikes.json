Have to say I never read it like that, and this does look like a gray area that needs ruled on. I did have success in this scenario popping Ranger Spikes into the staging area, killing the troll who prevents attachments, and then letting the trolls disengage, thus re-entering the staging area and getting spiked.\n\nDefinitely one to put in officially. Although, the text of the Ranger Spikes says:\n\n'If unattached, attach Ranger Spikes to the next eligible enemy that enters the staging area.'\n\nDoes this mean that the player attaches them (therefore making them ineligible for the trolls)?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79258-trolls-and-ranger-spikes/?do=findComment&comment=763003","commentId":763003,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1360910839,"content":"I've sent this one in for official clarification.  I'll let you know as soon as I get a response."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79258-trolls-and-ranger-spikes/?do=findComment&comment=763101","commentId":763101,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1360923648,"content":"I think it's pretty much clear that as you can't attach Ranger Spikes to enemies that are not eligible, Mumakil or the three trolls will not be effected by the Spikes.

There's indeed a difference in the wording if you compare the troll's text with Mumakil's. To me bot translates to \"no attachments on this enemy\", as this was clearly the intention for the Hobbit scenatio, but you might be right about this."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79258-trolls-and-ranger-spikes/?do=findComment&comment=763170","commentId":763170,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1360934893,"content":"Most of the time the devs shoot me down in these kinds of questions… we shall see! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79258-trolls-and-ranger-spikes/?do=findComment&comment=763211","commentId":763211,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1360942950,"content":"And official response:\n\n\"You are correct.
