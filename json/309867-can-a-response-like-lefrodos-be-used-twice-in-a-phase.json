Could you ready Rosie with Frodo (because she is committed to the quest), exhaust her to use her Action ability to add her willpower to a hobbit hero, and ready her again with Frodo (because she was committed to the quest) and now have her ready for the combat phase? Characters are considered committed to the quest for the entire phase unless there is some card effect that states otherwise. I know there are cheaper options like Fast Hitch to put on Rosie, but in a scenario where Frodo has some resources to burn and there isn't a Fast Hitch on Rosie, would that be a way to have her quest, use her Action ability, and then also have her ready for the combat phase (so you can use her Action ability again)?\n\n> 1 hour ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> If the quest is sucessful, I assume threat is lowered one for each response.\n\nI was wondering about that.

(\"Play during the quest phase, before the staging step. Action: Deal 2 damage to the first enemy revealed from the encounter deck this phase.\") I don't think anyone would just deal 2 damage to that first enemy revealed. Similarly, Frodo's ability triggered twice creates two instances of this delayed effect of (conditionally) reducing your threat by 1, so you should be able to resolve them both—I see no reason that it would matter that the two instances happened to come from the same physical card instead of two cards (as in the Expecting Mischief situation).\n\nEdited July 20 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309867-can-a-response-like-lefrodos-be-used-twice-in-a-phase/?do=findComment&comment=3963150","commentId":3963150,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1595238382,"content":"> 10 hours ago, bdavis969 said:\n> \n> What negative effects could there be?\n\nFor example your second unique character (which you will ready after the staging step) will still be subject to encounter card effects that target exhausted characters.
