Always remembered the Elves were particularly impressive throughout Tolkein's works, much unlike Warhammer Elves. And ninja warriors would be dreadful. To be honest, FFG did a pretty good job with the dwarves not to make them horribly cliched, and some of them really nicely reflected the lore of the dwarves. I expect them to do a good job with the Silvan keyword, in time. The Mirkwood Runner is still, in my opinion, one of the best designed allies in the game. Elegantly designed, I've always felt."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74119-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=722024","commentId":722024,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1352711142,"content":"One time I hate the film adaptation was during the Battle of Helm's Deep. Not as much for the presence of the Elven forces but much more for their weakness. In Silmarillion you learn how superior the Noldor were to orcs in battle. Of course not every elf was a warrior but one would think if Elrond or Galadriel sent an elite unite to fight, they'd rank among the best. And as such they should take care of even the Uruks easily, and certainly fight at least as wel as the likes of Aragorn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74119-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=722294","commentId":722294,"userName":"Ranger of the Force","timestamp":1352739412,"content":"While Sam was storming the tower in search of Frodo in Mordor, the orcs seemed to think it was an elf-lord and shuddered at the thought of it.  Would this not apply to all elves, Silvan and Noldor alike?   I was under the impression that elves were superior warriors on Middle Earth.  Am I wrong?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74119-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=722298","commentId":722298,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1352740295,"content":"Ranger of the Force said:\n\n \n\nWhile Sam was storming the tower in search of Frodo in Mordor, the orcs seemed to think it was an elf-lord and shuddered at the thought of it.  Would this not apply to all elves, Silvan and Noldor alike?   I was under the impression that elves were superior warriors on Middle Earth.  Am I wrong?\n\n \n\n \n\nno this is correct…..especially during the first and second ages elves were the finest warriors in middle earth. in the third age they were sort of 'loosing interest' compared to the previous ages, but still the best :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74119-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=722400","commentId":722400,"userName":"Ranger of the Force","timestamp":1352750108,"content":"Ah, thank you Rich as always.  Order has been restored in my conception of the Tolkien universe happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74119-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=722556","commentId":722556,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1352783961,"content":"Ranger of the Force said:\n\nAh, thank you Rich as always.  Order has been restored in my conception of the Tolkien universe happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\n\n\nno worries happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"}]}
