Emyn Muil is my least favorite of the four AP scenarios released thus far. The difficulty is highly frontloaded. You have a large starting threat, but if you can address it in the first few turns, threat becomes a non issue. At that point you have a long slog through the encounter deck, and it becomes an endurance match. Will you get brought down by direct damage from the event deck, or do you have enough healing to make your through boring turn after boring turn as you scour for the last few locations. I have loved every scenario so far, but this one falls flat for me.\n\nAs for player cards\n\n\nRide to Ruin/Ridermark’s Finest – I love these cards. With their addition, I feel like Rohan not only has a lot of cards, but a mechanical identity. Rohan characters are hellbent for leather. They are defined by abilities to quest, untap, and sacrifice themselves for big impact. I hope that every faction not only gets equivalent cards, but a equal interesting set of game mechanics.\n\n\nGildor Inglorin – Lore adds another high priced ally, and continues the trend of having the best allies, top to bottom, in the game. Amazing stats and a decent ability (which will combo quite nicely when we get the spirit dwarf from the big box), one of the few cards to really make me question whether or not Gandalf is worth it. A 3/2/3 for 5 that stays on the board? Yes, please!\n\n\nGildor’s Consel – I find this card fascinating. Yes, it’s almost worthless for solo play. But, you give up one turn’s worth of resources (1 card and three tokens) to keep from drawing 1 player’s worth of encounter cards (1 encounter card). Essentially, we have gotten the first “tempo” card in LotR LCG. If the encounter deck has board advantage, you don’t want to play it, but if you have the upper hand it becomes a solid play. I didn’t put it in either of my lore decks, but I am pondering it.\n\n\nDescendant of Throndor – Speaking of having a mechanical theme, eagles seem to be moving that direction as well. The descendant does two damage going in and two coming out, and eagles have a lot of bounce. Plus, willpower on a tactics ally. Reinforces Tactics/Spirit synergy, since you get the most bang for your buck when your threat is low. But he is a great way to wear down the big guns in an opponent’s deck. Or just to eat those annoying snipers.\n\nMeneldor’s Flight – Another 0 cost bounce card for tactics? It has timing advantageous over Bourne Aloft, but the the eagles only restriction means you have very few suitable targets for this effect, and you don't have access to crazy attachment recursion. Also, aside from the Descendant of Throndor, what eagles do you want back in your hand? Finally, it’s a pet peeve of mine, but this card should have the ‘Eagle” trait. The eagles are coming has it, so events are fair game for traits.\n\nKeen-Eyed Took – Looks like a great way to enable combos for the whole family. Not all that on his own, but people will find ways to to abuse the hell out of this. And, I imagine he will be permanently attached to Prince Imrhail’s hip in many a deck.\n\n\nRear Guard – I am not feeling it. Leadership needs, fairly desperately, imposing high cost allies (the kind lore and tactics have received), and they get this? For a card, a resource, and discarding an ally I get a one use poor man’s Faramir? Even best case scenario in a for player game, this is only going to generate 5 or 6 willpower. Highly situational, not highly effective. The best target for this effect, Snow born scouts, already has access to the FAR superior Ride to Ruin. I can’t imagine ever using this card.\n\n\nSong of Travel – Yes, we were expecting it and know all of its advantageous, but who knew it would have some of my favorite art in the game? I am not sure why, but I love the look of this card.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53957-the-hills-of-emyn-muil-an-ardous-exploration/?do=findComment&comment=535750","commentId":535750,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1317521803,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nI have now had a chance to play the scenario about 6 times, several decks, both solo and multi-player.

Though I fully expect the difficulty to ramp up with the last to packs of the Mirkwood Cycle, I really hope FFG continues this balance. The easy quests are great to take on the go, as I know they can be fairly easily played out during a lunch break or some spare time between classes. The hard quests are great to challenge at home where I have plenty of time to think out my moves, be more precise and often edit and rebuild my deck after failures.

Toughest part was not having meatshields around, had to throw Aragorn and Denethor against those 5 attack attacks, taking Wargs and Misty Mountain Goblins undefended for a couple of turns. Only saw 1 Sacked during the game and Theodred was released on the same turn. Denethor bottomed a Hill Troll and the other HT was drawn as a Shadow Effect. Ironically, one of the Trolls had Sacked as Shadow Effect on the turn he was Feinted."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53957-the-hills-of-emyn-muil-an-ardous-exploration/?do=findComment&comment=536952","commentId":536952,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1317741153,"content":"Did you manage to kill Threaty Troll before the others attacked, or did you misread his text?

So each got +3 Threat, putting them both at 35. Threat Troll was killed that first turn (actually badly, wounded, then Gandy came in next turn, but amounts to the same thing), so Morris and Stuart had to sit by and watch and be unable to increase threat. First play of that quest saw us take forever in the first stage and even with us both engaging only two Trolls each, +6 threat put us in high 40s. I think I hit like 47 or 48 before calling in Gandalf to lower it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53957-the-hills-of-emyn-muil-an-ardous-exploration/?do=findComment&comment=537118","commentId":537118,"userName":"xBeakeRx","timestamp":1317761676,"content":"A Paperback Hero said:\n\nRight now as the game stands the game has theoretically four easy quests:\n\nPassage through Mirkwood, Journey Down the Anduin, The Hunt for Gollum, and The Hills of Emyn Muil\n\nAnd the game has 4 hard quests:\n\nA Journey to Rhosgobel, Escape from Dol Guldur, Conflict at the Carrock, and The Massing at Osgiliath.\n\nThere seems to be a nice balance being maintained between easy and hard quests to meet the different playstyles and experience levels of the players.

From this point of view i didn look on quests. Yes sure we should have some easy quest. And sure Dead marshes and Return to Mirkwood should be really hard and interesting.\n\nHope Khazad-Dum will bring some new mechanic as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53957-the-hills-of-emyn-muil-an-ardous-exploration/?do=findComment&comment=537323","commentId":537323,"userName":"Untergeher","timestamp":1317804751,"content":"Just joining the discussion now... I think the perceived difficulty of the various quests depends on your playstyle and maybe on the way you approach them. I, for example, have never understood people complaining that Hunt for Gollum was too easy. HfG can be quite easy if the encounter deck is gentle with you, but it can release some devastating combos as well. This unpredictabilty (or even waywardness) made it a very difficult quest in my opinion.\n\nOn the other hand: We thought Conflict at the Carrock was rather easy once you had figured out to keep your threat low and prepare for the second phase of the quest... So this quest - as much as I still like it - didn't challenge our decks as much as did HfG. But then again, that's just my two cents!\n\nI'm looking forward to all the future quests, but very much welcome the idea of throwing in \"easier\" quests on the way! Cause sometimes you're looking for a challenge (Go get yourself imprisoned by some Dol Guldur orcs!) and sometimes you just wanna relax a bit (Why not take a stroll along the old forest road?)..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53957-the-hills-of-emyn-muil-an-ardous-exploration/?do=findComment&comment=537599","commentId":537599,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1317838593,"content":"It also seems that FFG releases a fairly easy quest right after a tough one.
