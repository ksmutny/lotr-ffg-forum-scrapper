So he exhausts two cards with an attack rating of 3 and 2 = 5. However, it's not enough to completely kill the enemy. Is it possible for another player, to act out of turn, and exhaust a ranged character to help in the attack. Or does he have to wait until play comes around to his turn in order to use his ranged characters.\n\nAlso, if it is possible for another player to attack out of turn with his ranged character(s), does his attack rating pool with the origonal players? Like, let's say he shoots ranged for two attack points. So would that be 3 + 2 +2 = 7 against the enemy. Or does his attack not \"pool\" with the other players (making it pointless for lesser valued range cards to even exhaust to attack (especially if the enemies defense is 2 so it's a wash). Not sure if I've made this question clear. Hopefully somebody will get it.\n\nThanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52270-ranged-attackes-how-do-they-work/?do=findComment&comment=520889","commentId":520889,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1314492940,"content":"Â The ranged character may be exhausted outside of the normal turn order to help attack with another player, and the attack does pool with the others."}]}
