This type of trigger means that the following action can only be triggered during the specified phase. For example, an effect with the trigger “Quest Action:” can only be triggered during an action window of the quest phase. Actions without a specified phase can be triggered during any action window throughout the round. (See the “Turn Sequence” chart on pages 30-31.) The hero card Glorfindel provides an example of an action that can be used during any player action window. The event card Radagast’s Cunning provides an example of an action that can only be used during the quest phase.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136513-combat-actions-playable-outside-the-combat-phase/?do=findComment&comment=1471462","commentId":1471462,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1425290138,"content":"I think you are correct… and that in turn makes me wonder if some of my victories against Shadow and Flame might have been invalid (maybe I used a few Feints to block attacks made by Durin's Bane during the Quest phase, when I shouldn't have)?\n\n \n\nArgh, another detail potentially missed… this is going to drive me crazy...\n\nEdited March 2, 2015 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136513-combat-actions-playable-outside-the-combat-phase/?do=findComment&comment=1471472","commentId":1471472,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1425290800,"content":"Another thing .. if an enemy makes an attack outside the combat phase there is mostly no action window where you could play feint before declaring the enemy as the attacker because the enemy is already declared as the attacker :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136513-combat-actions-playable-outside-the-combat-phase/?do=findComment&comment=1471506","commentId":1471506,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1425294328,"content":"Ennemies attacking outside normal windows will open a sub combat sequence that will allow player to play action.\n\nOf course, you can't play a feint when an attack has already started.

Super hard to find it back (or I'm just being super lazy). You just follow each step of an attack like described in the rulebook, just skipping the \"1. choose an enemy\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136513-combat-actions-playable-outside-the-combat-phase/?do=findComment&comment=1471649","commentId":1471649,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1425306006,"content":"Ok, that's the answer of how to manage a combat sequence outside the combat phase.
