Perhaps just to consolidate table space? Also, I guess there's a tiny chance you might forget about a hero buried in your discard pile (that would take a monumental degree of absentmindedness, though). \n\nIn general, though, I don't think it makes a difference. For the sake of formality, here's the relevant rules text addressing the original question (p. 20 of the rule book):\n\n\"Note that hero cards that are defeated are placed in their owner’s discard pile. When resolving effects that move cards from a player’s discard pile to his hand or deck, hero cards in the discard pile are ignored, as hero cards cannot move to a player’s hand or deck.\" \n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62299-stories-about-a-died-hero/?do=findComment&comment=609974","commentId":609974,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1332684128,"content":"starhawk77 said:\n\nrichsabre said:\n\n \n\ni would like to ask about this- ive always just put heros in their own discard pile, i didnt realise they went into the same one- im guessing my way of playing doest really make a diiference, as the hero never moves from either pile anyways?\n\n \n\n \n\nYeah, I can't see a reason why it would really matter.
