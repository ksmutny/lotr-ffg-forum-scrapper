There's no mention of what the upper or lower limit on difficulty is. Regardless, I'm excited to find out the level of difficulty of the new quest in Hunt for Gollum. \n\nWhile I'm waiting for June, I thought I'd ask the nice folks here: knowing that Mirkwood is a 1, Anduin is a 4, and Dol Guldur is a 7, what Difficulty Level would you like Hunt for Gollum to be? If you don't want to pick a number, you can always give a preferred rank in relation to the existing quests. \n\nSpecial secret bonus question: if you'd like, you can also predict where it will actually be ranked. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47059-your-thoughts-difficulty-level-of-hunt-for-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=471531","commentId":471531,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1305834691,"content":"I think a 3 would be good.

Since Escape from Dol Guldur is the \"hardest\" scenario we have so far and represents the final stage in our introductory story, I think that FFG would want the first scenario of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle to take a bit of a step back in terms of difficulty. The Core set comes with a series of three progressively difficult scenarios, which results in a relatively satisfying finish and conclusion to a short story. As the very first scenario in this new cycle, I think the Hunt for Gollum definitely won't be quite so easy as Passage Through Mirkwood, which is meant to introduce absolute beginners to the game, but that it will be something more challenging that presents a level of difficulty that will probably be neither overwhelming nor intimidating to people who are still getting a handle on how to play the game.\n\n\nIf it's less difficult than the current hardest scenario, I think it would appear less daunting to new or relatively inexperienced card game players, and would be much more inviting for people who simply want to casually play and appreciate winning more often than not. I would imagine that as more and more Adventure Packs come out, FFG can safely assume the skill level of the people who purchase them will likely increase (along with the pool of cards they have for deck construction), and therefore the difficulty of scenarios will slowly increase. I certainly believe that that in fairly short order the Adventure Packs will reach a point where they meet and then exceed Escape from Dol Guldur's level of difficulty, but to start out I am going to predict Hunt for Gollum to be Difficulty = 4.\n\n\nFurther, I am going to assume that Conflict at the Carrock (the second expansion), will most likely be difficulty level 6 or 7, purely from considering how powerful the only Troll enemy we've seen so far is. However, I could also picture it being even higher depending on just how nasty some of the new Trolls are, or how vicious the \"Sacked!\" Treachery cards turn out to be. Still, I suppose not all Trolls necessarily have to possess beastly high stats, but we'll see in due time. Now, if the expansions would just get printed and released already!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47059-your-thoughts-difficulty-level-of-hunt-for-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=471659","commentId":471659,"userName":"Vyron2","timestamp":1305862601,"content":" uuuuuh, just think about the Shadows of Mirkwood NIGHTMARE mode... that could be very interesting and challenging... since the threat threshold may be set higher than 50... imagine trying to get through SIX scenarios, once all APs are out!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is going to be an exciting fall/winter :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47059-your-thoughts-difficulty-level-of-hunt-for-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=472149","commentId":472149,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1305956636,"content":"Well, currently the difficulty numbers don't really mean much.

As mentioned before, quests will have to get exponentially tougher as time goes by because of the larger card pool. But how does it balance? A quest may be, say, difficulty 5 against today's card pool, but it will not be so a year from now. A quest that comes out in the future may be rated a difficulty 3 at that time, although if it were released today, it may be a 6. I believe, in the future, the numbers will reflect the level of difficulty against the existing card pool but will not make sense if you were to compare quests against each other. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47059-your-thoughts-difficulty-level-of-hunt-for-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=472479","commentId":472479,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1306024986,"content":"This is all purely speculation of course, but I'm not sure if we'll ever see the numerical difficulty ratings of existing scenarios change (in an errata or something).  I think that it'll probably end up being similar to when expansion packs are released for an MMO and the level cap for characters is raised.  For example, a scenario currently rated \"4\" may always be \"difficulty level 4,\" but as our pool of cards continues to grow and we (presumably) experience power creep, difficulty level 4 will simply represent less of a challenge than it used to be.  In this same vein, I think that eventually we will see difficulty levels continue to rise as expansions come out, so that the introductory scenario for our first deluxe expansion may be difficulty 8 or something, instead of the 1 that we see in Passage Through Mirkwood, even though (considering the current pool of cards at the time of release), these quests may be approximately equal in difficulty."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47059-your-thoughts-difficulty-level-of-hunt-for-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=472491","commentId":472491,"userName":"BD Flory","timestamp":1306032092,"content":"The numbers are all relative to each other anyway - it's not like there's some Platonic quest out there against which all other quests are measured.\n\nAs long as 1 is easier than 4 is easier than 7, we're good. My experience playing mostly solo and two player is that these numbers are pretty representative.\n\nAs expansions come out, it's just a matter of pegging where on that scale each new quest falls. If it's tougher than the intro quest but easier than journey down the anduin, f'rex, it's just a matter of figuring out whether it's closer to one or the other to peg it at 2 or 3.\n\nAs the card pool expands, the quest numbers can easily stay the same, because the raw difficulty doesn't actually matter - a difficulty 1 quest is still the \"easiest\" regardless of just how easy that is. If anything, as card pool grows for player decks and (theoretically) makes the game easier, we'll probably just see the ceiling on quest difficulty go up as tougher and tougher quests are designed.\n\nMy guess on Hunt for Gollum is that it'll be on the low side, maybe even a 2. It's the beginning of a new cycle after all. It wouldn't surprise me if we jump around a bit during the cycle though. The trolls will probably be tougher, so probably a 6 or even higher, but then we might come back down for the 3rd pack to something in the middle range. So, for example, difficulties might look like: 2,6,3,5,4,8 (or something). More variety than a purely linear progression of difficulty."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47059-your-thoughts-difficulty-level-of-hunt-for-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=472853","commentId":472853,"userName":"Saej","timestamp":1306105377,"content":"Perhaps, as the top limit for threat may go above 50, the difficulty of quests will reach above 10.  After one or two 'rounds' of CPs, maybe a CP will introduce a quest of challenge at 11 or higher.\n\nI can also see multiple 'sets' of quests for Nightmare mode.  The Hunt for Gollum may introduce quests of 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 (with perhaps a 'resting CP' where there is no quest, only player cards).  I think it would be great to see some 'resting CPs' along the way where they are all player cards without any quest cards.\n\n \n\nThis game looks great, I can't wait to see the tournament setup."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47059-your-thoughts-difficulty-level-of-hunt-for-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=476240","commentId":476240,"userName":"Kitsune Rei","timestamp":1306601508,"content":"Lightdarker said:\n\n \n\nThis is all purely speculation of course, but I'm not sure if we'll ever see the numerical difficulty ratings of existing scenarios change (in an errata or something).  I think that it'll probably end up being similar to when expansion packs are released for an MMO and the level cap for characters is raised.  For example, a scenario currently rated \"4\" may always be \"difficulty level 4,\" but as our pool of cards continues to grow and we (presumably) experience power creep, difficulty level 4 will simply represent less of a challenge than it used to be.  In this same vein, I think that eventually we will see difficulty levels continue to rise as expansions come out, so that the introductory scenario for our first deluxe expansion may be difficulty 8 or something, instead of the 1 that we see in Passage Through Mirkwood, even though (considering the current pool of cards at the time of release), these quests may be approximately equal in difficulty.\n\n \n\n \n\nI agree. With new powerful cards coming out, they will render earlier scenarios increasingly more trivial if you use the new cards for them. But I expect the game to be hard, since a lot of the baddies in the universe are pretty nasty. Their journeys were not an easy thing. I've felt like this game strongly follows the logic of a storyline, and this would continue to go along with it. You figure out challenges only to be faced with greater ones.\n\nI'd say the new one will be like a 4-5. Though right now I don't know what their formula really is. Difficulty can vary depending what you're playing with.\n\nThough I also think certain cards will continue to be desireable and may even grow in power with more choices to combo with.

Going below that would be a little anticlimactic. I buy expansions with the expectations to get a rewarding scenario.
