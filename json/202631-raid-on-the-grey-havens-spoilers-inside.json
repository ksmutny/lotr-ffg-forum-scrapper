It is rated a 7 and definitely harder than the other two. If you’ve played Laketown there are definite similarities - which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Laketown is a good tough quest imo. There are only two stages and you start off the quest placing Captain Sahir and this ugly pirate who looks like Belatrix Lestrange and whose name begins with an N aside out of play. “I’ll deal with them when the time comes,” I say to myself, not bothering to read the cards.\n\nSo I tried the quest solo and was playing out stage 1. I had slowly managed to gain control of the board and get some decent willpower out. Dreamchaser had 6/12 damage on it, but I had figured out how to manage that ok. Then I made a big push to get to stage two and managed it. Changed to stage two and read the card. Put Captain Sahir engaged with the first player - that’s me - and N- engaged with the last player - that’s me too. And another pirate to the staging area too. (No problem, I have Boromir defending for 5 with a Burning Brand right?)\n\nThen I read the cards for the Captain and his Tennille. “Wait, what?!” I read them again. And then I read the quest card. There must be some mercy here somewhere. After reading everything that triggers for the fourth time I take stock of my board and conclude I’m dead next turn regardless of what I do.\n\nI don’t want to spoil this since once you know what is going to happen it is much easier to prepare for. I won my second game - after some sideboarding mind - at threat of 47. I didn’t draw very well I think but I still won. There is a definite formula to this one, at least in single player. In multiplayer I think that it would be much, much tougher.\n\nAt the end of the day I have to give a thumbs up to the box. Three very nice quests with decent to hard challenge. Some good player cards that open up new avenues - especially for multiplayer I think. Grappling hook may be my favorite card. My favorite quest is the first one, “the sailing quest”. I was a bit dubious about the mechanic, but it’s done really well.\n\nGreat job designers and playtesters! (Except that windward MEANS against the wind!)\n\nEdit: It's DL6, not 7.\n\nEdited February 15, 2016 by Bullroarer Took"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202631-raid-on-the-grey-havens-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2053340","commentId":2053340,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1455560390,"content":"I thought that pirate girl was cute."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202631-raid-on-the-grey-havens-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2053374","commentId":2053374,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1455561879,"content":"> this ugly pirate \n\n \n\nEye of the beholder, I suppose."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202631-raid-on-the-grey-havens-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2053387","commentId":2053387,"userName":"raven614","timestamp":1455562122,"content":"@ took Please spoil it later I need your wisdom.\n\nEdited February 15, 2016 by raven614"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202631-raid-on-the-grey-havens-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2053417","commentId":2053417,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1455562864,"content":"The Dunedain trap deck paired with a Noldor Spirit/Lore deck did really well against this quest though you do get punished a bit for keeping guys around, the over all benefits were worth it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202631-raid-on-the-grey-havens-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2054152","commentId":2054152,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1455585364,"content":"> I thought that pirate girl was cute.\n\nI will concede that ugly may have been too strong, but cute?\n\n \n\nMoving on...

Thematically I like to try to keep the same deck together for all three quests in an expansion, but could not conceive how to do it here.  I was pleased to limit the changes to one hero. \n\n \n\nI spent many rounds painstakingly getting my allies out while keeping the Corsair count to a minimum. Elf-stone worked perfectly getting Beorn and OHUH Gandalf to the table while conserving resources for Forest Snare and Lords of the Eldar.\n\n \n\n2B began by chump-blocking with all three of my Sailors who were all previously readied by Elwing's Flight. I played that the Sailor's were all finished questing so all died in combat.  I thought for a moment that because they had been committed to the quest that they might not take damage in combat, but that can't be right, right?  Either way, helped by Lords of the Eldar, Cirdan, Treebeard, Galdalf, Galdor, Damrod and boosted Beorn took out Sahir.\n\n \n\nNext turn put Forest Snare on Na'asiyah and cleaned up locations over the course of two rounds.\n\n \n\nKudos to the designers for keeping the game fresh with fun, new mechanics and player cards that were easy to integrate and play without waiting for new APs to augment them.  The Noldor discard mechanics make deck building a bit easier for average types like me.  No need for perfect synergy when you have consistent card draw and the need for discard fodder.\n\n \n\nGrey Havens was my favorite expansion to experience for the first time.

Depending on what location comes up in set-up and what comes out in the first staging, you're likely dealing with 10-12 threat with a 4-attack, 3-defense, 5-hit point enemy (Sahir's Ravager) lurking in the wings. By the time I got over that first hump (if I did), it was usually with out enough build-up to withstand the smackdown of Sahir's Advance (both boss enemies + 1 more card) that comes when you flip to Stage 2A.\n\n \n\nThe extra resource at the start and a couple of the tougher cards pulled from the deck didn't make this quest \"easy\" by any stretch, but gave my heroes a fighting chance. A battalion of five engaged Corsairs ate through all of my allies while I kept whittling down Captain Sahir, but was just able to escape with a win. My hero line-up was Lore-agorn, Eowyn, and Arwen (a little deck I'm working on called Aragorn's Love Triangle) and it can be pretty fun!\n\n \n\nI would echo the sentiment that this is a great out-of-the-box experience. Yes, it takes a game or so to get used to the new mechanics (and the board state in this final scenario reminded me of the fiddly resource accounting that took place with the Dunlendings and \"Time\" in the Voice of Isengard / Ring-maker cycle). That said, it's not unwieldy or overly cumbersome, the story is great, and after 60+ adventures, it's amazing that the base game mechanics can still deliver a fresh theme -- the ships and pirates feel decidedly different as enemies than what we've encountered before.

Elrohir with Cloak of Lorien, two warnings and Lembas easily defended against her then healed with Lembas and defended Sahir without taking damage. Even with her 8 defense Na'aisayah was defeated right away and only Sahir was left to destroy. I managed to do so over the course of several turns ( I focused on removing damage tokens on aflame locations and clearing as many other enemies at the same time) and then got the last of the damage off the Dream Chaser the following turn. At one point it was on 11 damage due to treacheries and I got extremely nervous but by questing successfully I was able to take it back down to a reasonable level.\n\n \n\nCertain raider enemies are pretty **** nasty especially the one that takes a token from each hero when it engages you and gets +1 def for each resource on it. That card is awful against my decks and can easily net 2 to 3 resources each time. Luckily I kept threat for both decks below 40 so was able to engage them on my own terms. Cards like Miruvor and Lembas allow my decks to easily use up all of Elrohir's resources (and allow the raider to take 1 or no resources) and still defend multiple times with him. Miruvor is the best as you can ready him and add a resource allowing an extra 2 defenses.\nBy the end I only allowed two ships to burn down.\n\nReally loved this quest and to me it is a harder more punishing version of Amon Din!\n\nThink about it, aflame locations and ships placed under The Havens Burn (rather than burning buildings and dead villagers/rescued villager tokens), nasty enemies trying to spread the fire/destruction\n( Corsair/Umbar Raiders as opposed to Orcs and Craven Eagles) and a nasty Boss enemy/enemies at the end that directly ties their strength to the amount of tokens on an objective (how many dead villagers there are as opposed to how many damage tokens are on the Dream Chaser).\n\nIts a harder more punishing version (have to reveal cards when cards are placed underneath the havens burn and if you let a certain amount burn you instantly lose!) where there are two bosses at the end rather than one, tougher enemies with nastier effects and locations (ships!) that have some much nastier effects if they burn down as well. This is amazing as Encounter at Amon Din is one of my favorite quests but is just way too easy, the nightmare version is unfortunately extremely difficult (only played it once or twice but it was INSANELY hard those few attempts) so this new quest is just perfect! Going to play this one again real soon!\n\nEdited March 5, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202631-raid-on-the-grey-havens-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2085234","commentId":2085234,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1457129417,"content":"By the way, now that I have cards in my very own hands and I can observe art in fullest hirez possible, I reverse my judgement regarding the pirate girl.
