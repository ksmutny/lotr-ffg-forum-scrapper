At quest card 2B it says that \"after the staging step discard X additional cards from the encounter deck and add any enemies to the staging area. X is the number of players in the game\"\n\nNow the question is: are those enemies technically revealed?\n\nThis is important both for effects like Thalins \"deal 1 damage to enemies revealed while Thalin is commited to quest\" ability but also the Orc Horn Blower enemy which has both surge and a when-revealed ability that says to \"draw an aditional encounter card and add it to the staging area\" (kinda like a double surge). The surge itself is redefined in the FAQ as being triggered whenever the card enters play so that one is straightforward enough.\n\nAny and all thoughts on the matter will be appreciated"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60375-when-encounter-cards-are-revealed/?do=findComment&comment=593464","commentId":593464,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1329064043,"content":"Are you using non-English cards? The English card text on Stage 2B says, \"At the end of the staging step, reveal the top X cards of the encounter deck, adding all enemies to the staging area. Discard the other revealed cards without resolving them. X is the number of players.\" [emphasis mine]\n\nSo, the extra encounter cards are all \"revealed.\" Enemies are revealed and added to the staging area (triggering any applicable effects), while any other encounter cards are revealed and immediately discarded.

Thalin will damage any enemies revealed by the forced effect on Stage 2B of The Seventh Level. That effect specifically instructs players to \"reveal\" the encounter cards, and Thalin damages enemies as they are revealed. The staging step is part of the quest phase, and Thalin remains committed to the quest until the end of the quest phase. "}]}
