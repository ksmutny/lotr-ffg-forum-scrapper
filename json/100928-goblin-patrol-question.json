An enemy that makes an attack as part of its “when revealed” effect, is not in the staging area or engaged with the defending player unless a card effect says it is.\n\n \n\n \n\nIt's not the same situation but the answer reads that when revealed effects will trigger before a card is added to the staging area, so the Goblin Follower will engage the last player. After that, if the card would normally added to the staging area, discard it. The Goblin Follower wouldn't go to the staging area, so no discard."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100928-goblin-patrol-question/?do=findComment&comment=1757610","commentId":1757610,"userName":"midwestborn86","timestamp":1440627032,"content":"Adding to the staging area and revealing are 2 distinct ways cards arrive in the staging area. \"Reveal\" is a game mechanic. If you were to reveal cards during the quest phase for example and they are enemies, they get discarded via the quest card forced effect. But if it says search for an enemy and add it to the staging area you still add it. It isn't considered revealed though so any when revealed effects are not triggered.\n\nLikewise if you use the cave torch during this quest and discard an enemy, it is still added via cave torch effect because it wasn't revealed.\n\nReveal, add, and discard are all game mechanics.

In this case, an enemy that is revealed from the encounter deck and is about to be added to the staging area is replaced by placing that enemy in the discard pile instead.\n> \n> However, Goblin Follower’s ‘when revealed’ effect has it enter play engaged with the last player. That means it was not about to be added to the staging area, which means the replacement effect on stage 2B is not triggered. In short, the Goblin Follower will enter play engaged with the last player unless its ‘when revealed’ effect is canceled. If its ‘when revealed’ effect is canceled, then it would be added to the staging area and the forced effect on 2B would discard it instead.\n> \n> Cheers,\n> \n> Caleb\n\n \n\nSo, Question is answered."}]}
