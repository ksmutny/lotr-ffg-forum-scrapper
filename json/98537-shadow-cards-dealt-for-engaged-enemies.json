If I have an enemy engaged with me but he is trapped and cant attack, is he still dealt a shadow card? I know even if it does it doesnt resolve but I dont know if, since they cant even attack, if they go through that phase and get dealt a shadow card anyway.  Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98537-shadow-cards-dealt-for-engaged-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=974771","commentId":974771,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1391622317,"content":"He still gets a shadow card.  Just discard it at the end of the phase.  Same goes for enemies affected by Feint."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98537-shadow-cards-dealt-for-engaged-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=974781","commentId":974781,"userName":"la1cajun","timestamp":1391622766,"content":"ok. thanks grandspleen.
