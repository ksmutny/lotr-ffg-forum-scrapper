I would get what you are able to and eventually what is out of stock will come back around. There’s enough of a card pool now that missing some packs won’t hold you back too much.\n\nangmar Awakens cycle, the Dreamchaser cycle, and the Harad cycle are all very good!\n\nWelcome back to the game!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276300-returning-veteran/?do=findComment&comment=3341865","commentId":3341865,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1526912187,"content":"> 18 hours ago, etherealrich said:\n> \n> Firstly what have I missed?

We've also been introduced to Epic Multiplayer mode (up to twelve players) and are awaiting a new competetive/build your own quest format at Gen Con.\n\nI can't help with finding the old packs, though. I'm looking for them too, and I can't find them anywhere."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276300-returning-veteran/?do=findComment&comment=3341951","commentId":3341951,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1526916021,"content":"Seeing as the entire Dwarrowdelf cycle (including Khazad-dum) is Awaiting Reprint my hopes are they'll get bumped up to At the Printer here within the next month.\n\nEdited May 21, 2018 by stimpaksam"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276300-returning-veteran/?do=findComment&comment=3342272","commentId":3342272,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1526927582,"content":"Welcome!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276300-returning-veteran/?do=findComment&comment=3342411","commentId":3342411,"userName":"etherealrich","timestamp":1526932303,"content":"thanks for the replies and welcome, much appreciated :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] hopefully dwarrowdelf will be at the printers soon. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276300-returning-veteran/?do=findComment&comment=3344219","commentId":3344219,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1527021783,"content":"> On 5/20/2018 at 2:00 PM, etherealrich said:\n> \n> Hello everyone, I am an old player from the days when this game first was released, about to get back into the game.\n> \n> Firstly what have I missed?
