After giving it some thought, I can't see Glorfindel as a Spirit hero. He would be better off in Tactics or Leadership. Giving bonuses to Noldor characters or have an ability related to Slaying a Balrog.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65794-so-lets-assume-its-going-to-be-glorifindel%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=642795","commentId":642795,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1339383383,"content":"Keeping him ready somehow would be very poweful but given he's Spirit, it does not seem very likely. Although, there may be a trend of a diversion between \"ready\" effects and \"not exhaust\" effects. We Do Not Sleep is a Spirit card which allows not to exhaust. There  has been a case with Wrapped! where \"not exhaust\" would come off more useful; but it has been the only one.\n\nHaving 3 attack hero within the Spirit sphere would be a big boost no matter what. And it is hard to come up with a proper ability. Scaring off enemies might be both thematic and with the spirit of Spirit though.\n\nI hope ffg will let us know today who's coming. I have never considered myself an addict but this game has got me but good. I usually check the site many times on Monday to see the new preview. **** it if I have to wait till Tuesday or even Wednesday for Tolkien's sake."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65794-so-lets-assume-its-going-to-be-glorifindel%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=642797","commentId":642797,"userName":"Sprenger","timestamp":1339384011,"content":" What about..\n\n \n\nGlorfindel does not exhaust to commit to the quest. \n\nQuest Response: After an enemy is revealed during the staging step, discard X cards from the top of your deck to put that enemy on the bottom of the encounter deck.

The second one is good but it would have to be played around a bit probably because some of the baddies have lower threat etc. It could still work that way though. So I would quite like the response ability, something along those lines."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65794-so-lets-assume-its-going-to-be-glorifindel%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=642849","commentId":642849,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1339401577,"content":" This is a variation on an idea the Cardboard of the Rings guys had, but it would work thematically.\n\nGlorfindel\n\nThreat cost 15\n\nWillpower 0\nAttack 0\nDefence 0\n\nHit Points 2.\n\nAction: If the Balrog is in the Staging area, Discard Glorfindel from play to Add the Balrog to your Victory display.\n\n \n\nObviously, this would be useless outside of a Balrog quest.

It may be hard to avoid but it goes totally in contrary to the following story. It is almost like defeating Sauron in one of these pre-LotR times. None of the Fellowship (safe Gandalf) had any idea of the Balrog in Moria when they entered the Mines, did they? Now when I am thinking about it I wonder why from all the places the designers took us to Moria which should have remained un-scouted prior to LotR (except by Balin's expedition which a long time had sent no news)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65794-so-lets-assume-its-going-to-be-glorifindel%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=642875","commentId":642875,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1339406592,"content":"i wonder why moria at all? it certainly seems more challenging from a design perspective ie how do you keep it fresh when your always underground\n\nnot that im dissapointed in this cycle- completely the opposite- it just feels like moria could have been a later cycle"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65794-so-lets-assume-its-going-to-be-glorifindel%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=642901","commentId":642901,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1339408961,"content":"richsabre said:\n\ni wonder why moria at all? it certainly seems more challenging from a design perspective ie how do you keep it fresh when your always underground\n\nnot that im dissapointed in this cycle- completely the opposite- it just feels like moria could have been a later cycle\n\n\n\nSame here.
