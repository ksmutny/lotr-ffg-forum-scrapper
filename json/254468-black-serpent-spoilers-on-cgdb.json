Fastred is mentioned in the song of the Mounds of Mundburg as one of the Rohirrim who died in the Battle of Pelennor Fields, but I don't think anything else is known about him.\n\n> Quote\n> \n>  \n> \n> We heard of the horns in the hills ringing,\n> \n> the swords shining in the South-kingdom.\n> \n> Steeds went striding to the Stoningland\n> \n> as wind in the morning.

Like Fastred, I don't think we know anything else about Harding, Herefara, Herubrand, and Horn. I didn't expect to see any of them as heroes (though perhaps as allies), but the fact that Fastred shares a name (and a similar fate) with a prince buried at the Crossings of Poros (Théoden's great-uncle) likely accounts for Fastred's promtion to hero status."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254468-black-serpent-spoilers-on-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=2887908","commentId":2887908,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1500469220,"content":"I'm surprised by the lack of enthusiasm about Fastred.

I'm imagining a deck with Great Yew Bow and maybe Lore Faramir or Argalad having fun with bouncing enemies back to where they can be shot at. He could also be useful for getting specific enemies into traps after they've engaged, or making those staging area attack cards more viable for taking out certain enemies (or setting up big plays that need enemies in the staging area). If you play very low threat you could select which enemies to get a free threat reduction from providing they have low attack. Certainly an interesting hero, and a sign that the game is increasingly looking for alternative ways to play (rather than just engage and kill everyone). Does Fastred work well with a Dunedain engage deck for those quests that force you to engage an enemy?\n\nYeah, looks interesting. Actually this whole cycle has been fun for player cards. I'm getting a lot of enjoyment out of Thurundir in a Strider deck as well. Very cool.\n\nI also wasn't sold much on allies that only kick in under Valour conditions, but now I'm quite happy with that: Veteran of Osgiliath is amazing in Valour, and the Cair Andros Defender could be similarly useful.

As a sentinel B. is better in multiplayer from the get go.

I haven't tested it out yet, but I like what I see.\n\nFastred makes Dunhere much easier to play, as has already been noted. Also seems like a good enabler for Trap decks - which mostly want to send their enemies back to the staging area; it's much easier to control which enemy hits the trap that way. Mostly his ability really boosts staging area attack; if you aren't interested in that (in whatever form), you aren't hugely interested in Fastred. Might be able to do something interesting with Hama and Forth Eorlingas. Might even be able to do something janky with I Am Not A Stranger to get another high-attack hero attacking the staging area too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254468-black-serpent-spoilers-on-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=2893246","commentId":2893246,"userName":"silverGreen","timestamp":1500753571,"content":"How about Fastred + Desperate Alliance?  Get an unwanted enemy off another player and lower their threat by two for zero cost.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254468-black-serpent-spoilers-on-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=2893279","commentId":2893279,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1500755831,"content":"Finished my first game and while I did win it, I would have threated out the next turn.  I think I only drew two locations the entire game.  After one go I would say it's a hard quest, but not an 8, at least for solo."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254468-black-serpent-spoilers-on-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=2895196","commentId":2895196,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1500909043,"content":"I was hoping to get a bunch of games in this weekend but life intervened.  In any event I did get in a second attempt and it turned south quickly.  Scooped on turn four with a dead hero and only one ally in play.  So the quest CAN be a brute."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254468-black-serpent-spoilers-on-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=2897386","commentId":2897386,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1501010341,"content":"> On 24/07/2017 at 4:10 PM, Bullroarer Took said:\n> \n> I was hoping to get a bunch of games in this weekend but life intervened.  In any event I did get in a second attempt and it turned south quickly.  Scooped on turn four with a dead hero and only one ally in play.  So the quest CAN be a brute.\n\nI've only got a couple of games in so far, but i've not come close to a win yet. Seems brutal in solo.

In the early days of the Trap archetype I would have loved to see that guy.\n\nI finally got around to playing this last night, and with this particular strategy in one deck (Lore Faramir plus Great Yew Bow). The problem I have with that style is that it's hard to get Faramir up in attack high enough to kill enemies in the staging area, even with the effective +2 attack from The Black Serpent and the enemy you're attacking. I beat the quest, largely because the other deck (Elrond, Eowyn(t), Kahliel) was so strong and the Harad allies are really good - Jubayr in particular is epic against quests with a fair number of 3 attack non-unique enemies. I'm thinking that Gondorian Fire might be a way to make Faramir more effective?\n\nI do like Fastred though. His ability isn't that big of a problem, if you plan around it. My stupid mistake was to think that his ability could combo with Hobbit pipe, but that specifies event card threat reduction (reading fail on my part), so Frodo in that deck was useless. \n\nBlack Serpent, though, is *such* a good quest. Challenging but not in a *smashed in the face* way. You can think around it. Very good!"}]}
