There is no need to buy duplicates. Buying second core gives you more tokens and threat trackers plus copies of some cards, but buying another pack gives you almost nothing (unless there is a card that you need each player to have 3 copies of, but that has never been a case in my experience)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232390-4-player-require-2x-packs/?do=findComment&comment=2458534","commentId":2458534,"userName":"shosuko","timestamp":1476549835,"content":"I played with 4 people with just 1 core set okay.  You don't have as many cards, but each player can take a sphere as it's deck with the 3 heroes and you can play all of the quests this way to get a feel for the game.\n\n \n\nThe core set does include only 2 threat trackers, and there are some cards that are just 2x and 1x in the core set.  Purchasing 2-3 of these gets you a full set of threat trackers and sets of these cards but is not required in any way.\n\n \n\nEvery expansion comes with a full set of every card - so there is no reason to buy multiple of these just to play the game.  If multiple people want to use the same card set you can buy the expansion again to get more of the cards...  but there is no need to buy more than 1 of anything."}]}
