The racial synergies are weak outside of dwarf. Eagles are a distant second with their interweaving synergies between The Eagles Are Coming, Eagles of the Misty Mountains, and Radagast. Other than that, there are precious few trait based multi-card synergies. Everything else is mostly one off combos. I tend to think that they should be working towards more meaningful \"blocks\" of synergized cards that form the core of many decks. It is thematically stronger if these are based around race.\n\nRohan and Noldor/Silvan are well developed in numbers of cards, but very poorly developed in synergies that make it highly advantageous to keep the cards together."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64278-lack-of-cards/?do=findComment&comment=629307","commentId":629307,"userName":"player663513","timestamp":1336697997,"content":"I agree, there simply isn't a lot of synergy outside of dwarf, eagle and rohan. I was building new decks a couple of days ago, having previously used a rohan and an eagle deck, and wanted to try something new. I was a little disappointed that I could not build much in the way of powerful and clever combinations for silvan, noldor, ranger, dunedain etc.\n\nI guess it is coming, but it 's a little weird in my mind to release so many cards for certain themes that do not have any meaningful synergies (for example there are tons of dunedain cards, and they get nothing special out of being combined in a deck). A few well designed cards would pull the themes together and make them playable as a theme deck, but they simply aren't right now.\n\nIt will however be interesting to see the other themes developed, as I am sure they will
