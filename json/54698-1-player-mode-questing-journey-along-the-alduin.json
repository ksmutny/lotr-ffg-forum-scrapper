The preconstructed sphere decks will win Anduin only through dumb luck. The adventure requires you to build your own deck and think about your strategy. If you choose wisely Anduin is beatable. It gets even more easy if you include some extra cards from the expansion but this is no must for beating it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54698-1-player-mode-questing-journey-along-the-alduin/?do=findComment&comment=541857","commentId":541857,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1318578319,"content":" Agreed with everyone else.  You can definitely beat this scenario solo (I have many times)...keeping starting threat low is key to buy you a few turns to avoid the Troll, then, hope you draw a forest snare (I usually play lore against this quest), or a Gandalf or two. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] The most success I had beating this quest early on was starting with Gloin, Eowyn, and Beravor.

Today I finally decided to give in and try what people have suggested me to do. Go through it with a mono spirit deck. And I actually finally beat it! solo with this mono spirit 30 cards deck. I found Dunhere great and to my surprise also Elenor. So she had gotten a golden star in my book :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I had 3x Gandalf in the deck and took out the 2 Power in the Earth cards. First game with this setting I lost, second I won. And it was a great feeling. So don't give up :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
