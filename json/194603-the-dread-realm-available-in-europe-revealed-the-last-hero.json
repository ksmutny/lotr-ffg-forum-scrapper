I will probably just run 1 copy, if I run it at all. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194603-the-dread-realm-available-in-europe-revealed-the-last-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1911824","commentId":1911824,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1448831217,"content":"I like every single card from that pack.

It is already a thing (has been for a long time.....) and she adds very very little to it to be honest. Steward does a far far better job and the whole downside of the brothers ability is that you are using up resources you could otherwise save and spend on player cards, that is the entire trade off...\nIf you are discarding a card on various turns to give them another resource you are essentially not only using up precious resources you need for player cards but you are also discarding your precious player cards themselves!

I think it's broken in a 'Steward of Gondor is now spirit' type of way. Lore is the carddraw sphere and let's compare it with Elvish Light.\n\n \n\nBerevor: exhaust a hero to draw two cards turn\n\nvs\n\nCirdan with EL: spend 1 resource to draw two cards each turn\n\n \n\nBilbo: draw a card each turn\n\nvs\n\nArwen with EL: draw a card each turn with better stats\n\n \n\nLorien's wealth: draw 3 cards for 3 resources\n\nDiscard ability + EL: draw x cards for x resources + activate x discard abilities\n\n \n\netc.\n\n \n\nSo spirit can now do a lot of things only lore could do before (and better!) just because of one card. Maybe broken isn't the right word, but if this was a competitive game, a lot of players would now ditch lore in favor of spirit when it comes to splashing carddraw. There is also no limit to how many times you can use it (as long as you can discard cards through some means). It's also the Erebor Hammer Smith-Born Aloft-Legacy of Durin-Horn of Gondor combo in one card. Even if it's not broken now, people will find a way to break this sooner rather than later. For example, cards like Gaining Strength and Wealth of Gondor can now become 0 cost cards that replace themselves and add a small buff while doing so. I really wish this guy would go back into your deck instead of into your hand from where it can be discarded again. \n\n \n\nOn a more personal note, I dislike it because of how it changes the Noldor mechanic from 'discard a card' to 'discard a card OR draw a card and pay 1 resource'. Where I was intrigued before about how to fuel the Noldor trait and get enough carddraw, now all I have to do is add Steward of Gondor and done. It's like spirit Glorfindel where you take an interesting concept and add a card that nullifies what makes it interesting (light of valinor). :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] So yeah, not a fan of this card to say the least. But, I'll let it sink in for a moment and see if I'll grow to like it.\n\n \n\n \n\nOther cards look awesome though! Leadership sword that occasionally gives resources is great. I like having more weapons anyway. Another strong Dúnedain. Tactics event that's great in multiplayer and allows players to use heroes other than Boromir in a similar way for one turn. Only the hood is a bit quest specific which I'm not much a fan off. Also this pack really makes me want to try to build a Secrecy Aragorn Arwen deck. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194603-the-dread-realm-available-in-europe-revealed-the-last-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1914827","commentId":1914827,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1449004215,"content":"And lore has the most powerful threat reducing card in the game when threat reduction is supposed to be in Spirit.  Arwen and EL could have been better green though, I won't argue that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194603-the-dread-realm-available-in-europe-revealed-the-last-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1914994","commentId":1914994,"userName":"bobbywhiskey","timestamp":1449011064,"content":"As soon as I saw that the article for dread realm said it would have a spirit hero, I assumed it would be Arwen.

The possibilities and flexibility with her is insane. \n\n \n\nI have to say that I don't think Erestor enables the Noldor archetype at all.. He enables a discard archetype which is in a way a type of Noldor deck... A twins deck is technically a Noldor deck... An Elrond, Glorfindel, Galadriel deck is a Noldor deck.. there are a few different types of Noldor deck and the discard mechanic is definitely not the main or only type. Also most other Noldor heroes don't go so well with Erestor in my opinion. Arwen does but the Twins, Glorfindel, Galadriel and Elrond do not specifically mesh with him. Yes you can make a fantastic deck with him and any of these other two Noldor heroes but other than Arwen or Cirdan any of them can create a fantastic Noldor themed deck without him and without the discard ability as a whole. \n\nI personally am planning to run the twins and Arwen and then Elrond, Glorfindel and Haldir in the other deck. 5 of the 6 heroes are Noldor and I will be using Lords of the Eldar which unless I'm mistaken is the only card that boosts Noldor specifically. I would consider these Noldor Decks and they do not use Erestor at all and only utilize the discard mechanic minimally through Arwen, Elven Light and Lords of the Eldar. \n\n \n\nI think that Descendants of Kings and the two new dunedain allies (+1 attack or defense for each enemy engaged) definitely help a lot with Dunedain decks and are semi enablers but I think one or two more strong cards will really bring it to a new level. \n\nEldahir is a pretty badass ally and his ability seems pretty **** powerful, shadow reveal is nice and helps you prepare for that attack and his boosted 4 defense and sentinel are fantastic. Yes it costs you a lore resource but late game in the right deck you could use this most turns. \n\nEdited December 9, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194603-the-dread-realm-available-in-europe-revealed-the-last-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1925664","commentId":1925664,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1449641624,"content":"> Eldahir is a pretty badass ally and his ability seems pretty **** powerful, shadow reveal is nice and helps you prepare for that attack and his boosted 4 defense and sentinel are fantastic.

I vastly prefer my deck and think its a fair bit stronger.... in multiplayer that is!\n \n\nHis is definitely very cool and more thematic and obviously functions far far better as a solo deck whereas mine is specifically built to partner another Noldor deck (hence no light of valinor for arwen or many other spirit cards etc as those are in the other deck for Glorfy and Arwen's resources are transferred to her brothers or father instead and her spirit resources are only ever spent on Elvish Light or Lords of the Eldar) so I guess it is very hard to compare them really...\n\nAlso silver harp.....? that directly messes with discarding and playing elven light AND lords of Eldar.... I guess it is quite good with Elven Jeweller and Steed of Imladris though...\n\n \n\nI think he and I just have very different uses for Arwen, I use her mainly to buff her brothers and transform her resource into tactics or leadership every turn (whether during planning or during combat) allowing much higher cost tactics AND leadership cards to be included in the deck and allows for first turn elven mail or steward of gondor.\n\nHe is embracing the Noldor discard mechanic a bit more which is definitely very cool but I feel like that mechanic works so much better with Erestor/Cirdan and that Arwen is more useful (to me at least) as purely a resource smoother and a way to make both brothers far stronger but not really herself.\n\nI don't know.. the more I look at his deck the more I like it and see the subtleties but as someone who never plays solo (two handed/two player is unarguably the sweet spot for the game) it just doesn't appeal to me overall.

I was thinking that in multiplayer, especially if multiple players are packing Sword of Gondolin, this combo can instantly win you the game pretty easily. You can pack up Legolas + Aragorn (T) and whoever with those swords, let a few enemies engage everyone, then kill each one of them for 4+ progress each. So if the remaining quest points are less than 4 * number of enemies you instantly win. Theoretically you can get 6 swords of gondolin on your Wrath team for a whopping 8 progress for each enemy. Maybe add Gimli and a couple of Well equiped, Bofur to search for weapons, Book of Eldacar to get Wrath if discarded. Defender of Rammas, Derndingles and Longbeard Sentries for defense. Foe hammers for card draw and you can more or less completely ignore questing as long as you engage all enemies.\n\n \n\nI haven't tried this yet, do you think it can work?

This Limits its use, as does the Limitation of once per deck. Also you have to trick around with west road traveller and the like for it to stay in game.\n\nJust being an Event makes Hour of wrath that much better."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194603-the-dread-realm-available-in-europe-revealed-the-last-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1993128","commentId":1993128,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1452882882,"content":"Path of Need effects every hero though, and for questing - not just combat.  It doesn't have to go on the active location, so just put it on the location you are going to go to next.  The turn you travel there, your heroes don't exhaust for combat and the following turn they don't exhaust for questing.  Even without tricks to try to keep it around it is still often a game changer any time I've used it.  HoW is similar in that vein, but because it is an event you are correct that it is easier to use more than once - which is why it only effects one player's heroes, unlike Path of Need.\n\n \n\nTo be clear though, I'm not disagreeing that HoW is more versatile than PoN.  Just that they are very similar in outcome.  I just feel it is unlikely where you'd need to repeat the effect.  One turn of it's use will swing the game strongly enough in your favor that you shouldn't need a repeat use. \n\nEdited January 15, 2016 by Slothgodfather"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194603-the-dread-realm-available-in-europe-revealed-the-last-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1993854","commentId":1993854,"userName":"DunedainLoreKeeper","timestamp":1452903399,"content":"The difference is that Path of Need is a power card, while Hour of Wrath with Legolas is a game ender. Similar to how Seastan made a deck that could win the game by playing Ravens of the Mountain over and over again, Legolas, while not exhausting could put massive amounts of progress on the quest and keep going even when you go to the next quest phase. You don't just clear the board of enemies, you actually WIN the scenario instantly. All you have to do is defend for a few turns to build up enough enemies and find a way to get more Blades of Gondolin on your characters. I'll have to try it out someday I guess."}]}
