I've only a few 'Out of Stock' expansions to find. I tested it last night and while it was very fun, I didn't see a single Fortune or Fate.\n\n \n\nIt got me thinking - with my two roommates also joining me in games, one of whom has been building a Lore deck, are there cards in the game that permit a target player to search her deck for a specific card and either discard or draw it, shuffling the deck afterwards?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182893-deck-search/?do=findComment&comment=1698205","commentId":1698205,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1437415802,"content":"Gather Information, Word of Command, Mirror of Galadriel.

I was a quest wizard tho.\n\nI've actually found Eowyn/Caldara/Galadriel can do pretty OK combat-wise, because if you use Caldara to muster 4-cost Spirit allies, they all have 2 attack and 2 defence, which is the best you can get from Spirit allies. Hobbit Gandalf is also really useful. It's actually kind of my go-to deck for trying to solo Nightmare quests at this point."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182893-deck-search/?do=findComment&comment=1698793","commentId":1698793,"userName":"bubblepopmei","timestamp":1437450716,"content":"That mirror is unreliable! Haha it was fun but we won the game tonight before I even pulled Fortune or Fate into my hand. -___-\n\nI'm very excited to try Idraen. I think she'll be the muscle my list has been missing. I originally had Eowyn, Caldara,and Idraen in mind for my list but after trying Galadriel,her ring, and her mirror I am really at a loss for who to cut. Ironically, Caldara is the weakest link by far."}]}
