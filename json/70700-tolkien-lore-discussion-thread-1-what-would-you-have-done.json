Rivendell was many months as you mentioned, even King Theoden lingered as he rallied the Rohirrim to the cause of Gondor. \n\n \n\nThe only thing missing was a giant lingering in the middle of the battle of Helm's Deep where Aragorn stopped to explain to Pippin and Merry the finer points of sword play and eating second breakfast before a good battle in between orc slayings.  Although, I insist the \"Keeping count\" of Gimli and Legolas came pretty darn close.\n\n \n\nIt is easy to identify the one single character in the book Tolkien most identifies with….Treebeard.  Because an ent works on ent time and there is no ent discussion that is hasty.\n\n \n\nLOTR and the Hobbit don't jive, even though it is the same era.  There was an elven king in Mirkwood, talking trolls, talking spiders,

were even quite a few comical moments…the one that made me laugh the most is when Merry is in the \"Den of healing\" in Gondor and awakens from the black death and is embarrassed because he left his backpack on the battlefield and Aragorn just ignores the comment and continues to treat him.  Then when Aragorn leaves, Pippin calls him an ass and points to the backpack lying on the table along with him.\n\n \n\nSome of the battle details are rarely revealed.  Tolkien was more into discussing flanks and generals and captains and there were many, and it was interesting how the movies focused on just a few characters and made it very Braveheart-esque.\n\n \n\nTolkien also did a wonderful job with Smeagol/Gollum and the weight of the ring.  It was, by far, the best of his work in my mind.  I also thoroughly enjoyed how Tolkien handled Eowyn.  She was a much deeper character in the book.  Her anguish and agony regarding being left behind to be a maiden by Theoden and Aragorn and the deep hurt she carried as a result of it and Faramir's flirtations and daily walks to help her to recover and forget about it.  It was wonderfully done.\n\n \n\nIt's as if the movie just ignored the best parts and focused on the \"ok\" parts.  Two other things that make me slap my head is that Denethor had a palantir stone with him…and THAT Is why he went mad…not because he was just a panzy and Boromir died.  Also, Gandalf was the third elven ring of power holder!!  How could they have left that out!!\n\n \n\nAgain, I am

It's been a very long time since i've read TFOTR, but i recall not being really sure what the wights were, or what was going on when I read it. Was just a bit confusing i guess.\n\nAs for how the quest would have gone if they had an elf lord? Thats very hard to say. The thing is, the quest to destroy the ring had lots of problems, but in the end, it passed the test with flying colors. Think about it… out of the 9 members, there were 2 casualties (i'd argue 1.5). Thats actually pretty amazing when you consider what they're up against. I think glorfindel would have been a huge help… namely because I think he and gandalf would have been able to take Durin's Bane… but who would you cut? While i joke about the incompetence of the fellowship… its really hard to say any one member, even the most seemingly useless, was without purpose.\n\nCut frodo? Sure, he's a chump, but what good is Sam without frodo? We have to remember, EVERYTHING sam does that makes him a bad ass… fighting off shelob, carrying frodo up the kill, storming the Orc fort… its all out of dedication to frodo. If you remove Frodo from the equation, Sam really doesn't have much to fight for.\n\nBoromir… boromir f*cked up… sure, but look what happened. Sam and Frodo ran off alone, and the party split. If that didn't happen, who knows that they would have found a better outcome. Boromirs actions, while negative in themsleves, seem to have created a scenario that allowed for success.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70700-tolkien-lore-discussion-thread-1-what-would-you-have-done/?do=findComment&comment=691538","commentId":691538,"userName":"Captain Poe","timestamp":1347352946,"content":"I actually took a class on the LOTR in college… it was a class called Capstone that basically was an intro to college coarse… taught you how to write essays better… how to utilize the schools various learning aids, etc… and the professors were allowed to tailor the classes subject material to whatever they wanted… so my professor picked Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings (best class ever, in case you're curious… he was a history teacher, and a good one at that, and taught the class as such).\n\nOne of the lessons was about Gollum, and how one could argue that he was a hero. Basically, while gollum did all the wrong things, his actions, intentional or not, resulted in the destruction of the 1 ring. Without him, its fairly safe to say that Frodo would have attempted to claim the ring, that the nazgul would have showed up on mount doom and taken it, and all the efforts of the free people would have been in vain. So while certain characters may seem like they're all bad… if you look at the big picture, they ended up helping more then actually hurting in the long run.
