The largest collection of OCTGN plugins resides at http://www.octgngames.com [http://www.octgngames.com].  OCTGN now uses myget feeds to continuously update the plugins with the latest card releases/adventure packs.  (I think that's what you mean by \"decks\"). Find instructions for setting that up at http://octgngames.com/installing-games/ [http://octgngames.com/installing-games/].  As before, card art is censored for 6 months post-release.\n\n \n\n2.) The o8c's for the packs >6mo old are very high quality and can be downloaded from http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/image-packs/ [http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/image-packs/].  For packs <6mo old I scan my own.\n\n \n\n3.) You can use the filter settings in the OCTGN deck editor to change the expansions included in the card pool.  There are other deck editors with more sophisticated features out there as well.\n\n \n\nEnjoy!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192756-octgn-lotr-lcg-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1877457","commentId":1877457,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1446590096,"content":"Hi, thanks for the info!\n\n \n\nI have been using the filters in the deck editor to exclude packs that were released after the scenario I'm playing.\n\n \n\nHowever, each time a new deck comes out, I have to remember to update my [saved] filters to exclude that as well.  Since I have separate filters saved for each combination of spheres that I play, it's a bit of a pain to update the filters to include and exclude packs.\n\n \n\nWhat would be a lot easier is to simply \"uninstall\" whatever packs I don't want visible to the deck editor.  Is there a way to do that?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192756-octgn-lotr-lcg-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1877570","commentId":1877570,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1446594832,"content":"You should be using Rivendell Councilroom [http://ddddirk.github.io/lotrdb/] for your deck building.  The interface is 1000x better, you can select which packs you want to use, and you can export your deck as an .o8c file.\n\nEdited November 3, 2015 by Teamjimby"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192756-octgn-lotr-lcg-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1878513","commentId":1878513,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1446656045,"content":"Thanks for the tip; I'll try managing my decks with that tool instead.\n\n \n\nThat said, I'm still wondering: is there an easy to way uninstall packs from OCTGN?  This could be useful for hiding custom encounter decks, nightmare decks, etc. that I don't intend to go through at this time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192756-octgn-lotr-lcg-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1878555","commentId":1878555,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1446657455,"content":"No easy way no.
