I am relatively new to LCG, but got inot Warhammer: Invasion over the summer and love it. There's not a huge community of players, here though - and I do trvale for work, so LOTR and it's solo play are really appealing to me. I almost went with this game when I dove into LCG in the first place, and now that I know a bit more about deck building, am ready to give it a go.\n\nI was wondering if there was any website/program/tool similar to deckbox.org for this game. I really like the idea of being able to have all the cards right there a scroll away and assemble a deck virtually.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions? Or any other tips for a new player?\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72815-deckbox/?do=findComment&comment=709964","commentId":709964,"userName":"ArachneJericho","timestamp":1350336861,"content":"I usually use cardgamedb.com [http://www.cardgamedb.com/] for my deckbuilding.\n\nWelcome to the game!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72815-deckbox/?do=findComment&comment=709978","commentId":709978,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1350339404,"content":"I also use LotR LCG Deck Builder, by Zorbec, which needs installation to a PC with Windows OS.  However, you can use it offline.  You can download it at http://eric.minet.free.fr/lotrbuilder/index_en.htm [http://eric.minet.free.fr/lotrbuilder/index_en.htm]"}]}
