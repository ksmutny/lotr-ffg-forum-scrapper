I finished the cycle solo a couple of weeks ago .. I would go for Journey to Rhosgobel (maybe cause it is the only one I used solo my favourite tactics sphaire and won) , and also Return to Mirkwood cause it is tricky, quick and needs attention\n\n \n\nDouble playing I liked most the Hills of Emyl Myin (my wife also) ... or I should say that I enjoyed it most, and still we have not managed to win it double hehehehhe"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86254-mirkwood-cycle-favorites/?do=findComment&comment=813297","commentId":813297,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1373690348,"content":"1. Conflict at the Carrock\n\n2. Dead Marshes\n\n \n\nThis was actually pretty tough for me to decide because as a cycle, i think mirkwood had a lot of growing pains as the developers went through quest design.  It seems like most of the quests require a specific kind of deck to beat them which i generally dislike. A deck that is suitable to beat Conflict at the Carrock will likely not be able to beat Emyn Muil, neither of which would likely beat Journey to Rhosgobel.\n\n \n\nthat being said i like conflict at the carrock because it was the first big battle quest and i like dead marshes because its a quick fun quest you can play several times in succession.\n\n \n\non a side note: only reason Hunt for Gollum didnt make the list is because Hunters of Morder were the scourge of my existence when i started playing haha. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86254-mirkwood-cycle-favorites/?do=findComment&comment=813304","commentId":813304,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1373691204,"content":"> my favourite has and always will be hunt for gollum. im not sure whether it is because it was the 1st Ap so has a special place in my collection, or whether it is just a great, well balanced quest with great art...probably both.\n> \n>  \n> \n> 2nd choice is harder- they probably all come 2nd in different ways. return to mirkwood is up there in multihanded play, emyn muil has some of the best art, dead marshes is really unique, conflict at the carrock was the first major 'fighting quest', rhosgobel is again unique story telling\n> \n>  \n> \n> the whole cycle is still my favourite out of the two (i guess its too early to tell with ATS)\n> \n>  \n> \n> rich\n\nYes HFG is very cool!

It requires good planning (if you rush to the carrock in turn one the trolls will probably smite you but if you take too long your threat will force you to engage all of them and they'll smite you anyway). Plus in this cycle I think FFG hadn't thought solo play through as almost every scenario is really easy in solo play, or extremely hard (return to mirkwood) and CatC is one of the few that poses some kind of challenge.\n\n \n\n2) The Hunt for Gollum - I like the story behind it, where all your errands begin, and I really like the art of this scenario. Plus this is one of those few decently balanced quest for solo play in this cycle (though it's still pretty easy)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86254-mirkwood-cycle-favorites/?do=findComment&comment=813362","commentId":813362,"userName":"klaymen_sk","timestamp":1373711681,"content":"1 - A Journey to Rhosgobel\n\n2 - The hunt for Gollum"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86254-mirkwood-cycle-favorites/?do=findComment&comment=813425","commentId":813425,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1373726437,"content":"i'm surprised journey to rhosgobel is earning so may high regards, i would have thought it would be near the bottom. interesting indeed"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86254-mirkwood-cycle-favorites/?do=findComment&comment=813460","commentId":813460,"userName":"Alex6222","timestamp":1373732462,"content":"1.
