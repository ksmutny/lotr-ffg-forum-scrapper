So, any committed questing character's willpower would be subtracted from the total threat in the staging area, and then either any excess remaining threat would be added to the threat tracker or any excess willpower would be added to the active quest card as progress.\n\nKeep trying Skaak, it's worth it!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57370-question-about-the-quest-phase-and-threat/?do=findComment&comment=566391","commentId":566391,"userName":"Skaak","timestamp":1323602542,"content":"No part of the quest phase framework is optional.\n\nOuch.

If you have time it might be worth jotting down a few rounds into a thread as it is always possible you are doing something else wrong that makes the game more difficult- still counting the threat of engaged foes or moving engaged enemies back to staging area at the end of the round are two common errors some people made at the start\n\nStick with it, if you are playing correctly then it probably just a case of poor tactics - you are packing 3 gandalfs, and using him to keep threat down for example?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57370-question-about-the-quest-phase-and-threat/?do=findComment&comment=566416","commentId":566416,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1323610230,"content":"If Spirit isn't working for you, I'd suggest Leadership.
