Also do treacheries activate? In our first attempt at this my son and I placed the 3 objectives then revealed a king spider for the first objective card which when revealed forced us to exhaust a character, then we revealed another king spider for the 2nd objective card. Exhausted another hero. Then for the 3rd objective we got necromancers reach dealing 1 damage to each exhausted character. So during setup we lost a hero to being captured, exhausted 4 heroes, and dealt 1 damage to each? This left no one to quest, effectively raising are threat 10. All enemies attacked with no one to defend killing 3 heroes.\n\n \n\nJust bad bad bad bad luck or did we play something wrong?\n\n \n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182981-escape-from-dol-guldur-setup/?do=findComment&comment=1699754","commentId":1699754,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1437515807,"content":"You played it correctly.  That's a hard quest already, but man that is a brutal first turn.  Shuffle and try again, that's what I'd do.\n\n \n\nEscape from Dol Guldur is a very hard quest with only the Core Set."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182981-escape-from-dol-guldur-setup/?do=findComment&comment=1700010","commentId":1700010,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1437533052,"content":"That is one hell of a brutal setup.
