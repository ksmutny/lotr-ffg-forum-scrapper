Please arrive by 1:30pm. \n\n \n\nThe tournament will begin promptly at 2pm, and there will be a pairing process for those who do not arrive with a teammate.\n\n \n\nThere is no strict requirement that you bring a decklist with you, but decks must conform to the rules as stated in the latest Core Rules and FAQ, which can be found on the FFG support page for the game.\n\n \n\nThat said, please do bring a decklist. If people do this, then I will be able to run some statistical analyses on the data and post a bunch of interesting numbers for all to see after the event.\n\n \n\nAlso, the Race Against the Shadow format does require the use of a timer, such as a chess clock. There are plenty of mobile apps for this, and some phones do this anyway. That is something to be mindful of.\n\nEdited December 20, 2013 by divinityofnumber"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94856-race-against-the-shadow-tournament-ffg-event-center-minneapolis-mn/?do=findComment&comment=927121","commentId":927121,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1386643232,"content":"I'm out on the West Coast so I won't make it, but if I were local and had nothing to do I'd go. But here's the big problem which FFG is aware of: the game is designed as a cooperative effort - and it succeeds well at that. As it stands the game doesn't support enough archetypes for a pseudo vs game to work. I would put Dwarves at tier 1 and Outlands slightly behind. (But I'm only going on word of mouth for Outlands since I'm not interested in that play style.). Elves is a full tier down right now and attachments might be on the same level, but I'm not sure.\n\nA long as the scoring system doesn't penalize for dead allies one play style will reign supreme.

The main goal is, of course, speed.

You should give it a try, if you have a group of LoTR players in your area. It is fun to build some decks specifically designed to combat a particular quest, and to reach the win condition as fast as possible. It is technically a tournament, but does not have that intense competitive feel. It is a sort of group project to see who can design the best decks for a given scenario. \n\n \n\nAlso, aren't we always playing for points in some sense? Many people use the Quest Log, and I always keep track of my scores, even when playing solo. It is fun to reach new personal bests. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94856-race-against-the-shadow-tournament-ffg-event-center-minneapolis-mn/?do=findComment&comment=974753","commentId":974753,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1391621243,"content":"Nice write-up!
