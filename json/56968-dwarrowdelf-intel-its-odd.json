I for myself do not mind some Moria scare but after three quests in the deep I am all up for some fresh air.\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure that the end of Dwarrowdelf is back into the deep.  Here's a quote from the article that introduced the Dwarrowdelf cycle.  To me, it confirms that what was posted eariler is actually correct:\n\n\"A word from the designer\n\nThe Dwarrowdelf cycle allows players to travel along the Misty Mountains as well as delve deep into Moria. While the cycle’s narrative arc stands apart from the one in the Khazad-dûm box, the two are closely knit thematically. Players want new scenarios to feel as fresh as possible, which is why Khazad-dûm has six different encounter sets for use in the Dwarrowdelf cycle (whereas the Core Set has four). This allows us to better differentiate the areas players will be exploring and is why Khazad-dûm is a required purchase for anyone who wants to play the Dwarrowdelf scenarios.\n\nThe quests in the cycle are each meant to challenge players in new ways. Your heroes must survive raging snowstorms that lower their willpower, fight a watchful and crafty creature before the Doors of Durin, and find their way among a maze of labyrinthine passages within the depths of Moria.\"\n\nMy educated guesses:\n\nsurvive raging snowstorms that lower their willpower = AP1\n\nfight a watchful and crafty creature before the Doors of Durin = AP3 (see the Tentacle symbol on the Doors of Durin card)\n\nfind their way among a maze of labyrinthine passages within the depths of Moria = AP4 or AP5 (I don't remember the details of these two packs from what was spoiled earlier.  I only remember that APs 4-6 all happen underground in Moria.).\n\n \n\n "}]}
