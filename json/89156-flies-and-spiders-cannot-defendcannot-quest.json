Would the attack be considered undefended in that case? Same question was asked here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1025953/character-turn-into-unconscious-during-enemy-attac [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1025953/character-turn-into-unconscious-during-enemy-attac]\n\n \n\n2. It says all POISONED characters can't quest. Imagine Forest Stream is the active location while Lazy Lob deals one poison to every character commited to the quest. Is their questing power ignored then?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89156-flies-and-spiders-cannot-defendcannot-quest/?do=findComment&comment=849323","commentId":849323,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1377379029,"content":"The way you responded to my answer, wrong as it might have been, rather than helping you any further I'll let you find out on your own.
