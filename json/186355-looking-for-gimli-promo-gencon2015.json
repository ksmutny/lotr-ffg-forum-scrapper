One of the reason I bought into the LOTR LCG back in 2012 was that you presumably avoided having to chase \"rares\" or \"mythics\" around the world. But no!! First the playmats were released (why not sell these in the FFG shop?) and now they start to produce alternate art cards (Aragorn and Gimli so far). Why only award a very small crowd of players that have the chance to attend a specific conference? Why not give all their fans the option to get such a card without having to spend tons of time and money chasing it in the secondary market? In Denmark the only option to get these special releases is through eBay or similar. No game store I am aware of organizes LOTR LCG events. The nature of the game is not really well suited for events.\n\n \n\nAnyway, if anybody has an alternate art Gimli card they want to part with, then I am ready to pay a nice price for it.

Fellowship/Gen Con players already have benefits in obtaining and playing the quest early. It does seem fair to those players that are heavily involved in the game but don't live in the US to attend such events (I'll be surprised to find a Fellowship event running for the next quest)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186355-looking-for-gimli-promo-gencon2015/?do=findComment&comment=1874080","commentId":1874080,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1446403774,"content":"I have every POD and don't have alt-Aragorn.
