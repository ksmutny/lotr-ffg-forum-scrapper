I doubt that we will ever see heroes on the level of Spirit Glorfindel or Dain Ironfoot. This is a good thing - if anything those earlier heroes are too powerful. Silvan is a powerful archetype, particularly in multiplayer where you can have other decks cover the weaknesses (which it certainly has). I don't see it as being more powerful than the Dwarf or Noldor decks that were possible after the Dwarrowdelf cycle and Hobbit Saga expansions.\n\n \n\nGaladriel is powerful, but it takes some setup, and the right pairings, to really take advantage of her abilities. I definitely do not see Galadriel+Nenya as being more powerful than Elrond+Vilya, but she is perfect from a thematic perspective. Gandalf is definitely one of the most powerful heroes to be released in a while, but like Elrond, his high starting threat brings its own challenges, and he represents a strategy that can take a few rounds to get fully setup. Quick-hitting scenarios will continue to challenge decks that do not operate at something approaching full-strength in the early rounds.\n\n \n\nBy focusing on supporting new traits and archetypes, I think the developers are doing a good job of avoiding the kind of rampant power creep seen in many other card games. Ultimately, the scenarios are getting more difficult (overall - there are obviously individual exceptions) to help offset the power creep that is somewhat inevitable in every card game. Many players - myself included - strive to design more thematic decks, which is a downward pressure on power creep that you would not often see in a competitive game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127281-power-creep/?do=findComment&comment=1337852","commentId":1337852,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1416266910,"content":"Gandalf hero is a little overpowered (so is his Staff) but everything else so far seems fine.

Currently she pays 1 for her ability (which is good) and 4 for her willpower that she can't use without drawing into another item (taking up deck space, and that you have to spend resources on). \n\nIf instead she got 4 hitpoints and her ability for 4 (or even 5, if you were just trying to say you wanted her stats to be 0 and 0 cost). She would be amazing. \n\nYou could run Galadrial + Glorfindel for a threat cost of 9 (or 10). You'd draw two cards a turn and get two resources a turn, while offsetting Glorfindels disadvantage (until you got Light of Valinor, when you would instead offset threat gain entirely). You could run secrecy for 10 turns assuming you quested successfully every time.\n\nI mean sure, these two are a powerful secrecy deck anyway, but having draw 1 card and reduce threat by one, to be only 4 threat would be ridiculous. \n\n \n\nHer ability is arguably power creep (It means you can negate the threat gain at the end of the round forever - which is definitely a new power). Getting it for threat cost 4 would be absurd. Personally I think she should be threat cost 10, rather than 9."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127281-power-creep/?do=findComment&comment=1342612","commentId":1342612,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1416606231,"content":"Yep, her threat is definitely too low.
