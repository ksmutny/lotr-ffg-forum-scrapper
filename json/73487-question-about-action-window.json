I felt it rather confusing, all steps printed in green on page 30-31 are action window does not make sense,I think only the steps reads 'Player actions' are action window. Do I understand correctly?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73487-question-about-action-window/?do=findComment&comment=716551","commentId":716551,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1351568723,"content":"Your friend is correct.  Beside the Time Chart, on page 20 of the rulebook:\n\n\"To resolve an attack against an enemy, a player follows\nthese 3 steps, in order. Players may play event cards\nand take actions at the end of each step.\"\n\nActually, there are action windows in between the various steps of one single attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73487-question-about-action-window/?do=findComment&comment=716570","commentId":716570,"userName":"lordleon","timestamp":1351573246,"content":" OH,you are right!!
