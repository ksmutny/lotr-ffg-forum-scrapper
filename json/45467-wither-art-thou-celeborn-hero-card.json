I don't recall exactly.  But I see that Celeborn is not in the core set.  Makes me wonder what happened to it or if it just got delayed to another expansion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45467-wither-art-thou-celeborn-hero-card/?do=findComment&comment=456048","commentId":456048,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1303235398,"content":"Hopefully he will appear in an adventure pack soon. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45467-wither-art-thou-celeborn-hero-card/?do=findComment&comment=456780","commentId":456780,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1303336597,"content":"I am sure he will show up in the next cycle. After all the heroes have to deliver a message to Galadriel in the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. I wouldn't be too surprised to some Lorien action in the next cycle or the first expansion set! (As a big fan of Lorien elves I also hope for that of course angel.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angel.gif])"}]}
