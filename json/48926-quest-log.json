I was accessing it from the main page, but it's been removed from there. Is there another place I can find it?\n\nAlso, is there any way to share your log with other people? It's awesome being able to track scores, but it would be nice to have it show up on my profile or something."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48926-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=489825","commentId":489825,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1308825800,"content":" There is a \"More...\" tab at the top of the FFG pages.  The quest log is one of the items on its scroll-down menu.\n\nAs far as sharing goes, you can only share your scores with people on your List of Friends from your FFG profile."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48926-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=489831","commentId":489831,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1308826426,"content":"Doh... not sure how I missed that.
