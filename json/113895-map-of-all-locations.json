If this game were a solo/coop version of that, it would be pretty much the perfect game for me.\n\n \n\nThe problem is that I've yet to find a way to implement this in this game, if it is at all possible, because we have this quest system, in which each location or region of Middle Earth has a specific story and narrative associated with it. So you can't really explore Middle Earth as you like and do what you want because the encounter deck functions with the quest cards, and quest cards have necessarily a story attached to them. That is perhaps the main problem of this game in relation to this idea. Perhaps you could try using just the encounter sets and travel with your party to find enemies and such, but as I said, quest cards are just so important and have such a close relationship with the rest of the encounter cards that you can't just disregard them.\n\nEdited August 18, 2014 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113895-map-of-all-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1210750","commentId":1210750,"userName":"BoundForGlory","timestamp":1408405345,"content":"Yeah, I know that I'd lose a lot of the designers' intent without the quest cards.

Perhaps there is a unique player card that you could only get played at Edoras, or Lorien, or eastern Mirkwood, etc.  I don't want to make too long of a list, since I like to play most of my cards wherever I am.  And non-unique cards should be playable wherever you are.  But I am OK with requiring certain unique player cards to be played only at their \"home\" locations."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113895-map-of-all-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1237397","commentId":1237397,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1409333021,"content":"Yeah, locationbound would be really clever!
