It's tru that the wording on all the traps is ''Play Ranger Spikes into the staging area unattached.\n\nIf unattached, attach Ranger Spikes to the next eligible enemy that enters the staging area.''\n\n \n\nSo players do not play the attachment on the troll but they only attach it? Wow... That is so subtle... and it makes those traps even more tempting!!\n\n \n\nThat also explains the Forest snare that must be attached directly to the enemy getting blocked by the 'Players cannot play attachments on enemy'.\n\n \n\nWell, Damrod, you are now Boss.\n\nEdited December 3, 2015 by Lecitadin"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/165046-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=1917909","commentId":1917909,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1449179510,"content":"One thing to be careful about though: we do have cards like Oliphaunts and Mumaks that say \"Cannot have attachments\" or something to that effect.  These cards can't get a trap attached to them by any means."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/165046-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=1918041","commentId":1918041,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1449185255,"content":"> One thing to be careful about though: we do have cards like Oliphaunts and Mumaks that say \"Cannot have attachments\" or something to that effect.  These cards can't get a trap attached to them by any means.\n\n \n\nOr so you think!
