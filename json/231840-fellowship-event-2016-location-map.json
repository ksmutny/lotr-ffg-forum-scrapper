To our dismay, a minor delay in this process resulted in our German partner and others not being able to receive these kits in time.\n>  \n> As international shipping and customs can be very unpredictable, I do not have any information available for estimated availability of these kits. The only source of accurate information is likely to be Heidelberger, and I am sure they will keep stores updated as the kits arrive and become available for shipping.\n>  \n> I am sorry I do not have better news. I wish you and your community the best of luck in holding a fun and inclusive Fellowship event when the kits do arrive.\n>  \n> Best regards,\n> \n> Zach Reyburn\n\n \n\nSo .. we have to wait .. ship is on the way ..\n\nEdited November 10, 2016 by JanB"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231840-fellowship-event-2016-location-map/?do=findComment&comment=2497131","commentId":2497131,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1478807499,"content":"Thanks for the update on things Jan "}]}
