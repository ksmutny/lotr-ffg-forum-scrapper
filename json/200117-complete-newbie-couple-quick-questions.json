Ungoliant Spawn is a spider so you can search for it and put it into play if you are ready to face it and finish the quest, or it might already be in play in a Snare or waiting to engage someone, or you just aren't ready to face its effect so prefer to play out the game until you draw it naturally from the encounter deck at a later point.  Either way the game can't be won until it is defeated.  Unlike the Beorn Path which can be won so long as the UNgoliant Spawn is not in play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200117-complete-newbie-couple-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2017295","commentId":2017295,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1453935886,"content":"So essentially you can choose yourself between your options 2 and 3\n\n:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200117-complete-newbie-couple-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2026727","commentId":2026727,"userName":"rdw5150","timestamp":1454366097,"content":"Hi!\n\n \n\nWhat do you guys think, is it better to play 2 handed solo or constructed deck when moving to Anduin and Dol Guldur?\n\n \n\nThanks!\n\n \n\nPeace\n\n \n\nRoger"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200117-complete-newbie-couple-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2026854","commentId":2026854,"userName":"rdw5150","timestamp":1454370009,"content":"Hello!\n\n \n\nIs there a list of all the expansion abbreviations anywhere?\n\n \n\nBe nice to know what they all mean when looking at cards.\n\n \n\nThanks!\n\n \n\nRoger"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200117-complete-newbie-couple-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2026876","commentId":2026876,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1454370874,"content":"> Hi!\n> \n>  \n> \n> What do you guys think, is it better to play 2 handed solo or constructed deck when moving to Anduin and Dol Guldur?\n> \n>  \n> \n> Thanks!\n> \n>  \n> \n> Peace\n> \n>  \n> \n> Roger\n\nI'd say constructed for sure. The 30 card decks are fine for Passage through Mirkwood, but it's not the full solo experience. Anduin is totally possible, though difficult, with only core set 50 card decks. But it's possible you're more interest in 2 handed so it's up to you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200117-complete-newbie-couple-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2028506","commentId":2028506,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1454440111,"content":"Like I suggested in the other thread, I would go for constructed simply because it's less work for you.
