Took me about 10 turns and almost reached max threat, but Gandalf saved me once again. Decks were Beregond/Eowyn/Idraen and mono lore Bifur/Haldir/Faramir with a splash of tactics to turn Faramir to a secondary defender, which didn't pan out in play. Beregond was buffed with a shiny shield, x2 UC and x2 of the new green silvan meals that saved his life. I experimented with Gothlaf, Warden of Arnor and Haldir for the first time, and I found them all up to notch. Warden with Asfaloth seems like it would trivialise all those pesky 3 point locations.\n\nExcept for a buffed up Haldir, the decks lacked attacking power, so I had to defend 6 attacks in stage three. However, my questing power allowed me to finish the game next turn. Looking back, mono lore wasn't the best choice for this quest (so few enemies that traps are near useless) but I like rangers so there :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nDifficult, unpredictable and fun.

Ways to ready him are also essential. In the last stage I'll just take 1 Guardian at a time before traveling to the last location.

I put together a list that might perform okay against the easier quests, but would just get blown apart by the harder challenges such as Three Trials.\n\nIt's possible. Idraen would probably have to turn into the main defender. Arwen would have to get out soon, and Blood of numenor would help her later.\n\nBut here are the main problems I see without having another dedicated defender.\n\nThis is not the problem. The nice thing about her working with Glory is that they can both quest and l if there is location leaving play she and will ready, and Glory usually will have LoV. Then they can attack for 6. It's nice to get a readying effect on Idraen incase a location does not leave play.\n\nNow, without a 3rd hero as defender. You can't rely on Idraen readying after questing to defend so at least 1 UC is going to be needed to make sure she can defend. This would normally be the only insurance she would need to attack and quest every round, but now she will need an additional UC or other readying card to insure she will then attack. If you get stuck engaged with 2 enemies it will be tough to get out of, since glory has no way to boost his attack above 3, so he is relying on idraen or other allies to finish of most enemies.\n\nIn the early game LoV will be even more critical since it may not be wise to quest with Idraen in case she has to defend a low threat enemy. If she does not quest and glory does not have LoV yet he will need to exhaust to quest, and if you get engaged your probably done for. Since, she will be defending, and if he can not attack, it's only going to get worse next round.\n\nAlso, idraen can be turned into a solid defender, but it will take a bit of time. Blood of Numenor will help, but it takes resources to function, which will put more strain on Glory to pay for most things, so a few Resourceful on him will be necessary early.\n\nSo, you could probably make it through some of the easier quests, but I foresee a bumpy ride with a deck feeling like it's missing a wheel, and in my mind that missing wheel is a strong tactics defender.\n\nBut give it a try I'd like to hear how it goes. I'm just speculating here. They might work better then I think in actual game play\n\nOn another note Glorfindel And Haldir have some real potential for 2 hero secrecy, but song of battle and weapon attachments are critical early on.\n\nEdited August 24, 2014 by Tracker1"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111783-three-trials-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1222365","commentId":1222365,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1408894272,"content":"My conclusions are much the same as yours.
