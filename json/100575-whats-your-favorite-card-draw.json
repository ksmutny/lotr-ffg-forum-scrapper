I guess it's just that if you play with Steed of the Mark and Théoden you really don't need much help to force your way through the encounters. It's one thing I like about the first scenario (haven't played the other two so far) - they set up the encounter deck to punish card drawing decks, but at the same time they give you some opportunities to deal with that problem."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100575-whats-your-favorite-card-draw/?do=findComment&comment=1005965","commentId":1005965,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1394188401,"content":"I'd have to say that my 1st choice would be Daeron's runes.\n\n0 cost, draw 2, burn a 2nd unique card stuck in your hand.\n\nAll good stuff.
