the same boat.  I love scenic shots… and Howe's work.  Or even a single iconic figure on a mat…   What I have a hard time with is playmats that are TOO involved… busy, overly lush, or lots of

it (I know, that word gets way overused)… but I LOVE the perspective and depth this one has!  It almost feel 3D without being so… just amazing!\n\nBrownmantle said:\n\nThis one gives me

simple.  Not overly busy and cluttered…\n\n \n\nBrownmantle said:\n\n& a little something for custom sleeves…\n\n\n\nHonestly didn't care much for these… the Galadriel ones just didn't really do much for me, but perhaps that is because she is probably one of my least favorite characters in Middle-Earth lore…  The Frodo/Gollum/Sam one was a bit disturbing… honestly thought Frodo was either breaking up a very akward moment between Sam and Gollum… oooooor was about to join in.  Just saying.  Treebeard was okay… just seemed a bit cartoonish, but perhaps fit his personality in the books and the movies.  Looks both naive and wise, all at the same time.\n\n \n\nBut THIS one…\n\nBrownmantle said:\n\nhttp://bluefooted.deviantart.com/art/Eowyn-and-the-Nazgul-258220725
