I'm expecting one contract for each expansion to come. That would put us at 7 contracts, which opens up a lot of deckbuilding choices.\nI also hope that we get a Bilbo/Company contract soon. It's the one where an actual contract had to be signed, so it makes sense to get it into cardform soon. Perhaps focusing on his Burglar nature. As for other contracts, I think a Grey Company one would make sense, as that is a group of people that haven't gotten a card yet outside of the Sagas. Perhaps some army cards as well, but I have no clue on the phrasing on those contracts, hope they will be as fun as the two contracts we've gotten so far.

I'm still of the opinion that it's a great contract, if your deck focuses on having a lot of basic weapons on your heroes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300444-wrath-and-ruin/?do=findComment&comment=3826247","commentId":3826247,"userName":"AllWingsStandyingBy","timestamp":1573493388,"content":"> 10 minutes ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> I wonder what kind of probability that new contract has compared to a standard fifty card deck. Fourteen cards obviously increases the chance of seeing a card you want earlier, but card draw effects won't work like they do with the player deck.\n\n\nNot only that, but it actually requires traveling to locations, which many decks try to do as little of as possible (e.g. Asfaloth, Northern Trackers, etc.).  Given that it requires traveling to locations, realistically it will probably only get out 3-6 cards from the deck.  Still, 3-6 cards of guarded caliber isn't bad, and it's certainly fun, but it'll be hard-pressed to find a deck willing to give up on running cards like Steward of Gondor, Unexpected Courage, and the like."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300444-wrath-and-ruin/?do=findComment&comment=3826263","commentId":3826263,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1573495569,"content":"I think it is a pretty nice contract for multiplayer.
