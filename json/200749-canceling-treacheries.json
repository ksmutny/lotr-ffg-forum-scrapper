Plus, it would kind of steal Spirit's thunder--Spirit is the cancellation sphere so if you're going to make a Tactics card move in on that territory it would need to be a less powerful effect (or at least way more conditional one), not a more powerful one. \n\n \n\nBut maybe tactics could have some kind of event that did something like:\n\n \n\nResponse: cancel the When Revealed effect on a card just revealed from the encounter deck. Then put the enemy with the highest threat in the discard pile into play engaged with you. \n\n \n\nThis could be balanced because keywords would still trigger (like in Eleanor's case) and you are having an enemy still enter play. But an enemy is often something Tactics is more able to deal with than other treacheries. \n\n \n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > Hmm, perhaps more cancellation is needed, but most treacheries can be played around.  The ones that can't be played around you have to build your deck around which is a large part of this game for people like me.  I love that I can't just cancel all the treacheries and instead have to optimize my deck in order to trivialize, or at the least mitigate the encounter deck's threat.\n> > > \n> > >  \n> > > \n> > > One example of this to me is a card like the Master's Malice.  This card can completely obliterate a lot of otherwise strong decks.  However, this card can do absolutely nothing if you are running a mono-sphere deck.  If there was just more cancellation, I wouldn't even have to change my deck to deal with this card.\n> > \n> > Cancellation should be an option.

Some people (yourself included, I would guess based on the tone of your statement, but I could be wrong) enjoy the versatile challenge of building a custom deck to take on a given scenario. Others (myself included, so I'm hardly unbiased here) hate that part of the game and prefer the challenge of building a single, more flexible deck to take on all scenarios. \n\n \n\nAnd that's fine--different strokes for different folks and all that.\n\n \n\nBut--and here's where I think we disagree--adding a greater variety of cancellation doesn't hurt the people that want to custom-build for each Quest. But it does help those like me that want to build more flexible, general-purpose decks. The custom builder, after all, can always choose not to use a given card in their deck construction but not having it in the cardpool hurts others without having any upside. \n\n \n\n \n\n> I think the biggest thing is to take treachery/shadow control out of the stranglehold of spirit.

Hope that we see something, if not exactly like the event I proposed above, then at least similar in execution.\n\n \n\nTactics gets some treachery cancellation or avoidance in exchange for exposing them to some other challenge that is more within their wheelhouse to handle (engaging, adding or being attacked by enemies in all likelihood). \n\n \n\n \n\n> In multiplayer the sadly overlooked card Gildor's Council helps a lot.\n> \n> Well, this issue is a little more complicated.

In a more generally focused deck \"Free to Choose\" is a dead card probably 40% of the time. Weather Stained Cloak is dead closer to 75%.\n\n \n\nThis is actually a conflict in card design I think is happening more often lately as it looks like people really are trying to play the game in two very different ways. I mean, people always have but recently I have seen more discussion about it and complaints from one side or the other. \n\n \n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> > I think the biggest thing is to take treachery/shadow control out of the stranglehold of spirit.

True cancel-or-die treacheries are mostly a thing of the past, so one unlucky reveal without Test of Will shouldn't really spell disaster. Like DukeWellington says, they mostly have a limited set of effects, and those effects can be handled by more general purpose cards which you'll want to have in a deck that's designed to beat any scenario. Threat increaases are countered by threat reduction. Direct damage is countered by damage cancellation and healing. Extra threat is countered by better questing. Extra enemies or attacks are countered by good combat capabilities and readying effects. It's a very frequent occurrence for me when playing to look at a treachery, look at Test of Will in my hand, and go \"Nah, I can cope with this, save the cancel for something worse,\" often continuing to do this for the whole game and winning the quest with two or three copies of Test of Will in my hand that I never really needed.

I don't know.   Spirit is in a weird place right now,  a place it wasn't in when I first started the game.  Generally speaking Spirit doesn't fight well, and has good initial stats for Willpower, but nothing to boost these stats higher once you get to the mid/late game, and they have cancellation.  Would taking spirit's monopoly away shift people away from playing Spirit?   Probably at least some.  Maybe that doesn't matter.\n\nWhat I do think is important is that if we do get a new cancellation card, that it is non-repeatable and it comes with a cost that is more than just paying resources.  Maybe it could be like a 1-shot Eleanor where you cancel and then get a new card.   Or you could make it Doomed, but that was an idea I had before Keen as Lances and Favor of the Valar came out.  Maybe you have to remove say 2-3 characters from the Quest to use it.  That would be an idea.  \n\nSo, more cancellation:  yes.   Other spheres?  Sure, but I think we should leave Spirit with the best option in A Test of Will.  And make the card interesting, make it cost something.   imagine a tactics card where you have to remove 3 characters from the quest to cancel a treachery.   Cancelling treachery would be great...  do you really want to commit 3 of your characters to the quest?   Sometimes it would be no problem.   Sometimes it created a meaningful choice for the player,  and creating meaningful choices is what makes any game fun."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200749-canceling-treacheries/?do=findComment&comment=2022202","commentId":2022202,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1454116159,"content":"> I can understand that frustration, I suppose.  When I play 3-player, the game is quite a bit more challenging.  Northern Tracker and A Test of Will seem almost necessary for many scenarios while playing 3-player.\n> \n>  \n> \n> The two decks we use in two player to win most scenarios have pretty much what I consider to be all the strongest cards in the game :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n> \n>  \n> \n> I think it is odd that people want the standard game to be easier to accommodate thematic decks, though.  Theme is a self imposed handicap and as a result, the game will be harder.  The designers have even given players the option to play \"easy mode\" (which I've said before is terrible terrible marketing and should be called \"thematic mode\" so people wouldn't be so averse to playing it).  Easy mode allows thematic decks to do well while still enjoying the theme of your deck.\n\n \n\nSo, I agree 100% that \"Easy Mode\" is terrible. But I don't think it's just a matter of terrible marketing--it's terrible design.\n\n \n\nI've said for a long time (even pre-\"Easy Mode\") that the game should have shipped with each quest having a varying difficulty. And it should have been Easy (or thematic, whatever), normal, and Hard (or Nightmare, Hardcore, whatever). And it shouldn't just be a matter of removing cards but replacing them.\n\n \n\nThe problem with \"Easy Mode\" as-is (and the reason I don't play it even when playing with casual players) is that it removes some of the most interesting challenges in the scenario (and what they are balanced for) without replacing it with anything. In a lot of cases making the quest \"easier\" also makes it worse and that's a problem. Having a \"standard\" difficulty that would allow us to play some of the lesser-used and thematic cards while still providing some challenge and excitement and then allowing people to decide to go up (and just use all the best cards/combos) or down (and run purer, more thematic decks) from there is just a better way to balance things to make everyone happy.  \n\n \n\nBut hey!

I don't know.   Spirit is in a weird place right now,  a place it wasn't in when I first started the game.  Generally speaking Spirit doesn't fight well, and has good initial stats for Willpower, but nothing to boost these stats higher once you get to the mid/late game, and they have cancellation.  Would taking spirit's monopoly away shift people away from playing Spirit?   Probably at least some.  Maybe that doesn't matter.\n> \n> What I do think is important is that if we do get a new cancellation card, that it is non-repeatable and it comes with a cost that is more than just paying resources.  Maybe it could be like a 1-shot Eleanor where you cancel and then get a new card.   Or you could make it Doomed, but that was an idea I had before Keen as Lances and Favor of the Valar came out.  Maybe you have to remove say 2-3 characters from the Quest to use it.  That would be an idea.  \n> \n> So, more cancellation:  yes.   Other spheres?  Sure, but I think we should leave Spirit with the best option in A Test of Will.  And make the card interesting, make it cost something.   imagine a tactics card where you have to remove 3 characters from the quest to cancel a treachery.   Cancelling treachery would be great...  do you really want to commit 3 of your characters to the quest?   Sometimes it would be no problem.   Sometimes it created a meaningful choice for the player,  and creating meaningful choices is what makes any game fun.\n\n \n\n100% agree that Spirit is in a weird place right now (especially as Noldor is kind of taking their \"play out of the discard pile\" thing away from them). Easy (or easier) cancelation should be a thing that is exclusive to Spirit. But that doesn't mean that other spheres can't have some means to do it. It just needs to be more costly--but in a way that makes sense and can work for that sphere. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200749-canceling-treacheries/?do=findComment&comment=2022219","commentId":2022219,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1454117042,"content":"> Having a \"standard\" difficulty that would allow us to play some of the lesser-used and thematic cards while still providing some challenge and excitement and then allowing people to decide to go up (and just use all the best cards/combos) or down (and run purer, more thematic decks) from there is just a better way to balance things to make everyone happy.\n\nThe standard difficulty level of quests already meet those criteria.\n\nDon't believe me?

That's awesome--there's nothing wrong with that, I just don't think the game's default state should be balanced based on a minority of superior players. That's what  a harder mode should be balanced for. A harder mode that, in my example, would not be something you would have to purchase seperatly ala current Nightmare decks and would still be harder than the current baseline. \n\n \n\nThe simple fact is that--I think, there's really no empirical way to prove this--the majority of players find this games normal mode very challenging with all but a select number of decks/combos. Some people are naturally better at the game/have more time to develop those skills than others but I would say the average finds it challenging-to-hard. \n\n \n\nI think that player is what the normal difficulty should be balanced for rather than the best cards/decks and/or the most skilled players. There should absolutely be content for those players--I was just saying I wished the content would cater to a greater variety of players. The way it attempts to do so now (Easy Mode and additional-purchase Nightmare Decks) isn't particularly satisfying.\n\n \n\nObviously this is all my opinion. \n\n \n\nEDIT: \n\n \n\nAlso, apologies to @Rajam.

Otherwise we are talking about a stealth nerf to Spirit generally and it takes away another of Spirits defining characteristics. \n\n \n\nThat's where I disagree -- I don't see cancelling when revealed as \"one of Spirit's defining characteristics\", or see Spirit as \"the cancellation sphere\".  I see Spirit as \"the sphere that has Test of Will\", and through lack of alternatives that certainly has made Spirit more popular than it otherwise would be, but it's still just one card.  Spirit's defining characteristics are dealing with threat and willpower, and there's a metric ton of those cards in Spirit.  Between those two effects and spirit's dominance of Rohan, and all the great spirit heroes, I don't think we need to worry that Spirit would fade into obscurity if its prize card had weaker alternatives in other spheres.  What it would do is prevent players from feeling that they *have* to run Spirit or feel the full wrath of the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nFor a project I'm posting about on BGG, I took a look at 100 decks from different people on cardgamedb.  Spirit had the largest number of heroes (90) and was in the largest number of decks (60).  Test of Will, as you might expect, was by far the most popular Spirit card, but there were other popular cards (by presence in a deck, not number of copies):\n\n \n\n46x Test of Will\n\n35x Unexpected Courage\n\n32x Galadhrim's Greeting\n\n28x Hasty Stroke\n\n27x Arwen Undomiel\n\n23x Elrond's Counsel\n\n23x Northern Tracker\n\n22x Light of Valinor\n\n \n\nTest of Will is in a bit over 75% of the spirit decks and in nearly half of all the decks.  Only Core Gandalf (55 decks) was more popular.  Gandalf has two alternative versions.  Why not Test of Will?  The other six popular Spirit cards all have inferior alternatives in other spheres, and still do good duty to this day.  Why not Test of Will?\n\n \n\nIn the beginning, Test of Will had a monopoly on cancelling \"when revealed\", and Hasty Stroke had a monopoly on shadow cancellation.  But in the second AP we got our first non-spirit cancellation card in A Burning Brand -- and the second AP also had the *last* Spirit card to have \"cancel\" in it, Frodo Baggins.  In the subsequent releases there are three tactics cards to cancel damage (once Frodo's monopoly), two Leadership cards and a hero to cancel shadows, and three additional Lore cards to cancel enemies, quest damage, or any encounter card at all (with setup).  There are also cards that discard shadows (instead of cancelling them after seeing them) in all four spheres plus neutral.\n\n \n\nIt seems to me that Lore has the widest variety of cancellation effects, and since manipulating the encounter deck actually *is* a personality of Lore, that Lore would be a logical place for expanding treachery handling.  Indeed, Lore already has the only other card that mentions \"when revealed\" in Don't Be Hasty.  Indeed, in order to broaden treachery handling in the card pool in general, it is necessary to do it in other spheres, simply because Test of Will is so cheap and effective.  It wouldn't do away with Test of Will any more than even A Burning Brand did away with Hasty Stroke.  (Actually, a lore attachment that made a character immune to treachery effects would be pretty sweet without unbalancing, I think)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200749-canceling-treacheries/?do=findComment&comment=2026684","commentId":2026684,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1454364931,"content":"And people criticize me when I say that Spirit got the silver spoon."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200749-canceling-treacheries/?do=findComment&comment=2027047","commentId":2027047,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1454377848,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > I've no objection to any of the spheres getting treachery cancellation.  Spirit isn't \"the treachery cancellation sphere\" because it has a wealth of cards that deal with treacheries.  It's the \"treachery cancellation sphere\" because of one Hero and one player card -- and the player card doesn't even single out treacheries!  The only sphere that can cancel a treachery card outright (with  the help of Out of the Wild) is Lore.\n> > > \n> > >  \n> > > \n> > > I don't see any philosophical reason that *every* sphere can cancel shadow effects in one way or another, but only Spirit can cancel a \"when revealed\".  While \"when revealed\" effects are generally more powerful, the cost can correspondingly be higher.\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > That's true, but Out of the Wild doesn't specifically go after treacheries.

Otherwise we are talking about a stealth nerf to Spirit generally and it takes away another of Spirits defining characteristics. \n> \n>  \n> \n> That's where I disagree -- I don't see cancelling when revealed as \"one of Spirit's defining characteristics\", or see Spirit as \"the cancellation sphere\".  I see Spirit as \"the sphere that has Test of Will\", and through lack of alternatives that certainly has made Spirit more popular than it otherwise would be, but it's still just one card.  Spirit's defining characteristics are dealing with threat and willpower, and there's a metric ton of those cards in Spirit.  Between those two effects and spirit's dominance of Rohan, and all the great spirit heroes, I don't think we need to worry that Spirit would fade into obscurity if its prize card had weaker alternatives in other spheres.  What it would do is prevent players from feeling that they *have* to run Spirit or feel the full wrath of the encounter deck.\n> \n>  \n> \n> For a project I'm posting about on BGG, I took a look at 100 decks from different people on cardgamedb.  Spirit had the largest number of heroes (90) and was in the largest number of decks (60).  Test of Will, as you might expect, was by far the most popular Spirit card, but there were other popular cards (by presence in a deck, not number of copies):\n> \n>  \n> \n> 46x Test of Will\n> \n> 35x Unexpected Courage\n> \n> 32x Galadhrim's Greeting\n> \n> 28x Hasty Stroke\n> \n> 27x Arwen Undomiel\n> \n> 23x Elrond's Counsel\n> \n> 23x Northern Tracker\n> \n> 22x Light of Valinor\n> \n>  \n> \n> Test of Will is in a bit over 75% of the spirit decks and in nearly half of all the decks.  Only Core Gandalf (55 decks) was more popular.  Gandalf has two alternative versions.  Why not Test of Will?  The other six popular Spirit cards all have inferior alternatives in other spheres, and still do good duty to this day.  Why not Test of Will?\n> \n>  \n> \n> In the beginning, Test of Will had a monopoly on cancelling \"when revealed\", and Hasty Stroke had a monopoly on shadow cancellation.  But in the second AP we got our first non-spirit cancellation card in A Burning Brand -- and the second AP also had the *last* Spirit card to have \"cancel\" in it, Frodo Baggins.  In the subsequent releases there are three tactics cards to cancel damage (once Frodo's monopoly), two Leadership cards and a hero to cancel shadows, and three additional Lore cards to cancel enemies, quest damage, or any encounter card at all (with setup).  There are also cards that discard shadows (instead of cancelling them after seeing them) in all four spheres plus neutral.\n> \n>  \n> \n> It seems to me that Lore has the widest variety of cancellation effects, and since manipulating the encounter deck actually *is* a personality of Lore, that Lore would be a logical place for expanding treachery handling.  Indeed, Lore already has the only other card that mentions \"when revealed\" in Don't Be Hasty.  Indeed, in order to broaden treachery handling in the card pool in general, it is necessary to do it in other spheres, simply because Test of Will is so cheap and effective.  It wouldn't do away with Test of Will any more than even A Burning Brand did away with Hasty Stroke.  (Actually, a lore attachment that made a character immune to treachery effects would be pretty sweet without unbalancing, I think).\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nSo, I would argue that between Hasty Stroke, A Test of Will and Eleanor straight out of Core Spirit absolutely is the cancel sphere. Yeah, it's only three cards. But there really aren't any cards in the other spheres that do a better, less conditional job than these. Years later. For me that is a defining part of the sphere along with threat reduction, action advantage and high willpower. \n\n \n\nNow that doesn't mean I don't want more ways to cancel outside of Spirit. I just hope they don't undercut Spirit in what I consider to be one of its niches. \n\n \n\nHave a Tactics cancel--just make them engage an enemy or take an attack for it. Have Lore--but make it only work for one character (ala Burning Brand). Have Leadership--but make them discard a ally for it. \n\n \n\nBut honestly, forget all that. We can agree to disagree. The main reason I wanted to reply here was to commend you--because ****, dat research, tho. I love that you went to that length and supported what you were saying with that kind of detail. Yeah, I personally see it a little differently but I am still super impressed. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200749-canceling-treacheries/?do=findComment&comment=2027188","commentId":2027188,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1454386170,"content":"> Now that doesn't mean I don't want more ways to cancel outside of Spirit.

You can only put it on a Lore Hero and it only protects that one Hero. Honestly, if we are not counting the conditional nature of the effects outside of Hasty Stroke then I would say Leadership has the best Shadow cancellation in the form of Balin. "}]}
