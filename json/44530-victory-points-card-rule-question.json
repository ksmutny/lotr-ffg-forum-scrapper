Although I have to admit, that it could be a bit more explicitly stated to remove any doubts.

Implicit rules are always less clear than explicite rules.\n\nThe rule on page 24 'clearly' contradicts the rule on page 20.\n\nSo, either the rule on page 20 should state that only cards not granting VP are placed on the discard pile and/or the rule on page 24 should note that this is an exception to the rule on page 20. That would make it explicit rather than implicit, and thus more clear.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44530-victory-points-card-rule-question/?do=findComment&comment=447385","commentId":447385,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1301653206,"content":"Seriously, we know that is how its supposed to work so why argue over it.
