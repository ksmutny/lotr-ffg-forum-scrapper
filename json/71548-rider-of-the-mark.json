Also it dose say it requires a spirit payment to swap, so both players need a spirit icon on a resource generating hero.\n\n \n\nffg_rider-of-the-mark-rtr.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_rider-of-the-mark-rtr.jpg]\n\nEdited July 7, 2013 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71548-rider-of-the-mark/?do=findComment&comment=809557","commentId":809557,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373201989,"content":"or you could use this just before triggering the action. though its not a particularly effective strategty\n\nffg_a-good-harvest-tsf.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_a-good-harvest-tsf.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71548-rider-of-the-mark/?do=findComment&comment=809635","commentId":809635,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1373215634,"content":"This is another one of those weird \"meta\" questions, but does paying ta resource o trigger an action count as \"paying for cards that belong to the named sphere\" per good harvest's text?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71548-rider-of-the-mark/?do=findComment&comment=809656","commentId":809656,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373219320,"content":"> This is another one of those weird \"meta\" questions, but does paying ta resource o trigger an action count as \"paying for cards that belong to the named sphere\" per good harvest's text?\n\ni would say so - i think technically you are paying 'for' the card, just to activate and play it\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71548-rider-of-the-mark/?do=findComment&comment=809695","commentId":809695,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1373225289,"content":"I went ahead and submitted a rules question about that just to be sure."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71548-rider-of-the-mark/?do=findComment&comment=809696","commentId":809696,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373225661,"content":"thanks-i look forward to seeing if im correct or not\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71548-rider-of-the-mark/?do=findComment&comment=809699","commentId":809699,"userName":"cyberlettuce","timestamp":1373226010,"content":"Oh one other thing on this, can you give control of the rider when he is exhausted to get rid of the shadow card?

Not for paid abilities. This is what seperates \"A Good harvest\" from the Leadership Belt for example. One adds a resource icon, that allows payments for any effect, and the other statesthat it only works for \"PAYING\" for a card... witch means paying the cost of casting it.\n\n \n\n \n\n> Oh one other thing on this, can you give control of the rider when he is exhausted to get rid of the shadow card? Or does he have to be ready?\n\n \n\nIt is hard for MTG players to get a grip on, but in most LCGs being tapped dose not affect the cards ability to activate its text. There are a number of cards that do, but as they are an exception they have \"exhaust\" as part of their costs.\n\nEdited July 8, 2013 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71548-rider-of-the-mark/?do=findComment&comment=810395","commentId":810395,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1373334916,"content":"Sorry, bzzzt!
