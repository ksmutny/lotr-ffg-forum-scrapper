I played Hunt for Gollum. My first non core set adventure. \n\n \n\nI did win on the first try. It took 11 full rounds.\n\n \n\nI felt like I was treading water until I finally drew Celebrian's Stone and put it on Aragorn. After that, all the resources he had piled up from being Steward of Gondor poured into Spirit cards.\n\n \n\nI ran into a situation that I don't recall happening before. I constantly quested with Thain.Since he puts a damage token on any creature that pops from the encounter deck. When Eastern Crows pops up, does the Surge keyword take effect before they receive the damage token from Thain? I played it as though it does.\n\n \n\nAnd am I reading this correctly? That you only need one clue in order to in the game? I had 2; One for each deck. So, I knew I was covered there. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98649-and-so-it-begins-errr-continues/?do=findComment&comment=1003063","commentId":1003063,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1393983340,"content":"The official ruling is that Thalin kills the crows before they can surge.

But, I finally managed to beat Conflict at the Carrock yesterday. \n\n \n\n12 turns. I ended up with all 4 trolls engaging my tactics/leadership deck at once. Which was manageable since my spirit/lore deck had the resources to pull off 2 forest snares. And add to that Grimbeorn and Legolas to go with a Dunedain Marked Dwarven Axed, Unexpected Couraged Citadel Plated Gimli. With 4 damage on him. We call that a beatdown.\n\n \n\nThe last couple of times I had played this quest I kept getting closer and closer. The first few times I didn't even make it to stage 2 before I had 50 threat.
