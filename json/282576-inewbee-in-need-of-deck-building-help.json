Of course, if you play/open progression style (only using player cards that were released at the time of the quest you are playing's release), you might want to drop down to thirty cards for the first couple quests.\n\nTry to have questing, attacking, and defending covered between the decks. If you play solo, have one hero to quest, one to attack, and one to defend.\n\nWhat kind of decks you want you/your sons to play? We could help a lot more if we had a general idea. Also, I'll echo what's been said above and recommend RingsDB."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282576-inewbee-in-need-of-deck-building-help/?do=findComment&comment=3470070","commentId":3470070,"userName":"Finch204","timestamp":1536931173,"content":"> 3 hours ago, Thozam said:\n> \n> I'm new to the game and I love it so far. I just wonder if someone could help me and my sons with some decks and/or deck building tips.
