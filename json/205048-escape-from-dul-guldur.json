While I disagree with the above poster - I know you *can* beat the scenario with just the core (although it's much easier if you have more copies of core cards, a second core), it's quite a challenge. It's also slightly easier the more players you add, as the 'penalty' of losing a hero is mitigated by a larger hero pool, and the penalty of the damage caused by the objectives is mitigated by the same (although the 'penalty' of being able to play only one Ally is amplified - you can build your decks to reduce the emphasis on multiple cheap allies).\n\n \n\nIf you're looking for some pointers on beating it, you could check out one of the many 'progression series' videos where people tackle the scenarios in the order they were released, with only the cards available at the time. Here's an example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BchGbL76v8I] (although they use cards from multiple cores - you could consider printing up proxies to try the decklists they suggest).\n\n \n\nThat said, I would definitely recommend throwing yourself primarily at the Journey Along the Anduin scenario - it's not necessarily easier, but it is a little less subject to variance and a better learning experience.

There  are some hard to get rid of enemies in the deck. Also more Spirit helps keeping threat low and quest through. I always found that the quest goes much easier on you if you rush it and don't try to Control it.\n\nObviously you put the map (usually the first artifact claimed for Phase 1b) on eowyn (if possible). Don't pick the last 2 artifacts until you have to (iirc you just Need them to pass from 2b to 3)\n\nThe quest has 2 key Points: Set up and Phase 2. If The set up is bad and your Hands are too you will loose 90% of the time (sadly nothing you can really do about that), so make sure your Hands are able to do good right from the start.\n\n2nd Thing you must be ready to is to take on the nazgul. your best bet with a coreset is to feint him and one shot him.

Being able to Play a stewart of Gondor in your first turn and converting that into a tracker (what is exactly what happens in the Video, even though you could argue giving stewart and celebrian Stone to aragorn, who would get a Spirit Icon that way, would have been even better), who takes care of most Locations for you, makes everything much more managable. Even without the tracker stewart is never bad, as you should have enough Cards to spend the ressources on. Having sneak attack + Gandalf makes Things much easier, too (this Combo circumvents the 1 ally restriction of the quest, allow a 2nd use of Gandalf and helps wherever you Need it). Unexpected Courage can be great too for example on berevor or Gimli as they can both make good use of 2 Actions per turn.\nSo if you don't have something in that regard in your opening hand I would suggest a Mulligan. In this quest it is just fighting fire with fire. The Encounter-deck starts with a brutal Advantage and has some nasty Cards, so all you can do is bring out the best you can draw, too -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205048-escape-from-dul-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=2681260","commentId":2681260,"userName":"Estel Edain","timestamp":1489423489,"content":"Depending on what encounter cards you get early on (for the three objectives, and during the first turn of staging), it can be almost impossible to beat the quest.  Discarding cards to boost Eowyn's willpower, optionally engaging enemies before you can kill them (to limit threat in the staging area), and controlling locations with Snowbourn Scout and perhaps Northern Tracker are all ways to avoid getting overwhelmed by threat.\n\nIf you're playing with one Core set, I recommend using 40 card decks. Building two 50 card decks with only one core set requires you to use several weaker cards, which lowers the power of your decks (and the rule book mentions 30 card starter decks). You might want to take a look at Beorn's Path, which is a useful new player's guide to deck building, deck tuning and playing: https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/ [https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/]\n\nBeorn designs and tunes one of his decks in parts 1 and 3, and builds the second deck (for Escape from Dol Guldur) in part 5. He then gives an example of playing through the quest with both decks in part 6. In one of his comments to the article, he mentions that even as an experienced player, he only beat the quest on his third attempt. Escape from Dol Guldur with one core set is quite difficult, but if you get a decent start it's definitely possible."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205048-escape-from-dul-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=2681317","commentId":2681317,"userName":"LittleOrc","timestamp":1489424714,"content":"> 44 minutes ago, Slothgodfather said:\n> \n> Which quest/card are you questioning?    Also, are you playing with just a single Core set?\n\nWe cannot get past the first card of 9 progress tokens haha!
