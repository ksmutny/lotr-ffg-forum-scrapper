Where should we go from here? (can't find the second hobbit at the moment or we'd do that).\n\n \n\nKeep in mind: we'll be playing through everything sooner or later. Second, it's totally your opinion: what would you do.\n\n \n\nThanks!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99806-okay-what-next/?do=findComment&comment=991973","commentId":991973,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1393025417,"content":"I'd play Khazad Dum, ooooh when i remember my old times...
