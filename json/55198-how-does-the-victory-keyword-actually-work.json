When such a card leaves play,\none player should place it near his threat dial to remind\nthe players of the victory points when they are scoring\nat the end of the game. It is recommended that one\nplayer collects all the victory cards the players earn\nduring the scenario, as victory points are applied to the\nscore of the entire group.\n\nThe highlighted section indicates that the cards, for example enemies, are kept to one side once defeated effectively being removed from the game, however, the main rules state that defeated enemies are placed in the encounter deck discard pile....It seems to me that the rule for victory trumps the goes to the discard pile rule...but that may just be wishful thinking.......\n\nI don't see anything on this in the official FAQs......\n\nAnswers on a postcard please....."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55198-how-does-the-victory-keyword-actually-work/?do=findComment&comment=546173","commentId":546173,"userName":"Untergeher","timestamp":1319382091,"content":"Cards with victory points on them don't enter the discard pile and are never shuffled back into the encounter deck when\n\na) they have been defeated by the players (enemies)\n\nb) fully explored by the players (locations)\n\nThey do enter the discard pile when they showed up as a show effect though...\n\nHope that clears that up for you!"}]}
