Per the FAQ (p. 3), you can only declare one attack against each enemy per combat phase. However, individual characters can attack the same enemy multiple times, provided each attack is legally declared (this usually means attacking during your combat step and then using ranged to join an attack declared by another player).\n\nDefinitely seems like a good fit for a Legolas with Unexpected Courage or some other readying effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62112-rivendell-blade/?do=findComment&comment=608667","commentId":608667,"userName":"Faradey","timestamp":1332360720,"content":"The thing that bugs me about the 'ranged' trait (or whatever it's called) is that it counts a player's total attack, not just the printed attack strength.

So, say you control Elladan and Elrohir, and are engaged with three enemies. Elladan (equipped with Rivendell Blade) attacks one enemy, reducing its defense by 2 and applying his attack of 3. After the attack, he can pay a resource to ready. Then, he can attack one of the other engaged foes (but not the one he just smacked). Rinse and repeat as long as he has resources to spend."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62112-rivendell-blade/?do=findComment&comment=609045","commentId":609045,"userName":"Bomb","timestamp":1332424642,"content":" \n\n>  \n> \n> starhawk77 said:\n> \n> Bomb said:\n> \n>  \n> \n> I'd think that Elladan would be best since he can restand each time he's declared as an attacker.\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> Good call.

How would he do this?\n\n \n\nI understand how that sounds confusing.  Elladan would have 3 attack STR with Elrohir out.  If he had the Rivendell Blade attached, against an enemy with 2, it would almost be like attacking with 5 STR character against a 2 DEF enemy because he'd be taking away 3 HP.\n\nPretending the Rivendell Blade instead added +2 ATK strength to make it 5 ATK against a 2 DEF enemy, you'd be doing 3 HP damage.  With Rivendell Blade, you'd be doing 3 ATK STR against a 0 DEF enemy which would also net 3 HP damage which would be the same result.  Make sense?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62112-rivendell-blade/?do=findComment&comment=609164","commentId":609164,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1332447610,"content":"Anodos said:\n\nstarhawk77 said:\n\n \n\nI see what you're saying, Angus, but I agree with Anodos.
