He shuffles little pieces of cardboard across the desk's surface, organizing and reorganizing them, trying desperately to find some meaning in the shapes before him. He inhales sharply, as if expecting a blow as he quickly flips one of the cards over. The silence hangs for a moment before his head lolls forward and his held breath escapes all at once. \"Not again,\" he mutters, \"Not again! When will this Nightmare end?\"\n \nI'd like to share with you the project I've been working on for the past couple of months.\n \nI call it Darkling Door [https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/] - a phrase taken from the song sung by Aragorn about the adventures of Beren and Luthien - and it has been my passion project for a little while now.\n \nAbout the blog\n \nThere has been a lot of interest in the LotR community in Nightmare quests lately. There's currently an active thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232149-nightmare-decks-experiences-and-rankings/] about it, PsychoRocka is doing Nightmare reviews in his excellent new blog [https://warriorsofthewestblog.wordpress.com/], and the insightful Warden of Arnor is considering covering [https://wardenofarnor.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/the-line-unbroken-ring-maker-cycle-wrap-up/] Nightmare quests soon as well. Nightmare mode isn't just for Glaurung [https://www.youtube.com/user/olegyd/videos] anymore!\n \nWe've also seen a lot of insightful discussion on the dichotomy between \"Power\" decks and \"Thematic\" decks. The Grey Company did an illuminating podcast [https://greycompanypodcast.com/2016/10/10/47-power-vs-theme/] on it recently, which JR of Peace and Thought responded to [http://www.peaceandthought.com/voices-at-the-door/power-vs-theme-a-problem-of-language/], not to mention the innumerable posts on the subject here on the FFG forums. I have always fallen more on the \"Thematic\" side of things myself, finding the greatest enjoyment out of building and playing decks with a cohesive narrative.\n \nConventional wisdom, however, says that Thematic decks typically aren't going to be good enough to beat most Nightmare quests. In fact, it's pretty common for Thematic decks and Easy mode to share the same breath.\n \nI would like to challenge that conventional wisdom. The focus of my blog will be using Thematic decks to beat Nightmare quests.\n \nIf you have a few minutes, please check it out!\nhttps://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/ [https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233428-darkling-door-a-thematic-nightmare-blog/?do=findComment&comment=2476611","commentId":2476611,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1477544867,"content":"The first actual nightmare quest article will be up tomorrow, but for now I have a post on what I actually mean when I say \"Thematic deck\". :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233428-darkling-door-a-thematic-nightmare-blog/?do=findComment&comment=2476700","commentId":2476700,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1477554439,"content":"Sounds great!

More than a year ago [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178282-solo-deck-to-beat-escape-from-dol-guldur/] I made it my goal to find a way to beat it in normal mode (although not with just Core set cards, that's for sure!)\n\n \n\nI really don't know how different my solution would be without also trying to build a thematic deck. I probably still would have gone for a similar solution, but perhaps I would have thrown some Ethir Swordsmen and Pelargir Shipwrights in. My intuition tells me that a little more willpower would go a long way to make the deck more consistent. I might also go for the good ol' Good Harvest + Steward of Gondor combo just to help with the resource problem of a missing hero.\n\n \n\nSomething tells me the designers didn't play this quest solo, or at least not very many times. It's not really designed for less than two players, I think."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233428-darkling-door-a-thematic-nightmare-blog/?do=findComment&comment=2636497","commentId":2636497,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1486868827,"content":"Shadows of Mirkwood is now complete, and I just posted the first quest of Khazad-Dûm today!
