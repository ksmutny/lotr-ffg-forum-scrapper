I am also ticked that they have jolted the news feed and printing schedule of this game simply because the Hobbit movie is dropping this December. Talk about obvious money making, but hey, I am not against the \"spirit of Capitalism\" per se, just pissed that the hype has died down from the command center. C'mon FF, start being a little more consistent with this game. \n\nWhat keeps me visiting your site frequently is hoping a new write-up on the LOTR LCG will be posted. Alas, too many days have gone by now and I maybe visit your site once every 12 days now. Good job keeping me away! Now, assuming those who descent with me actually read my entire rant here, before you say that I am stupid or whatever, realize that I am only frustrated with FF BECAUSE I am a huge fan of this game and expect consistent updates. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70748-latest-news-23-days-old/?do=findComment&comment=692154","commentId":692154,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1347436824,"content":"i visit the site multiple times a day still as the game is my primary hobby- but everytime i look at the news and still see 'heirs of numenor' i sigh…..however not all players are as dedicated as those on this thread and regulars…..many will tire if no news is posted"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70748-latest-news-23-days-old/?do=findComment&comment=692210","commentId":692210,"userName":"Zalrus9","timestamp":1347444082,"content":" I have to say I'm kind of miffed as well at the lack of updates, but I also understand that I have been spoiled by Wizards of the Coast and their daily updates on their Magic the Gathering site.
