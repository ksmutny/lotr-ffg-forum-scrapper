Mine are:\n\n \n\nA Shadow of the Past: 68\n\nA Knife in the Dark: 59\n\nFlight to the Ford: 50\n\n \n\nI played with another player (2P) in standard mode using highly thematic decks which i will post in this thread later when i have some spare time.\n\n \n\nWe beat ASoftP in our first attempt and chose Gandalf's Delay and Mr. Underhill as our boon/burden cards. It took us three attempts at AKitD which we eventually won and then chose Tireless Ranger & Noble Hero as our next boon cards. FttF took us only two tries but we ended up earning two new burdens which wasn't all that good.\n\nHow about you guys?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92070-your-best-score-from-br-quests/?do=findComment&comment=888739","commentId":888739,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1381790250,"content":"Those are some impressive scores.\n\nThese are my scores for solo using the happy hobbit deck I put together. It's in the deck building section.\n\nASotP 83\n\nAKitD 110\n\nFttF 60\n\nAKitD seems to be the toughest of the three.
