Does it end immediatly after the conditions of the last quest card are met, or at the end of the refresh phase?\n\nI ask because if a game was won at the end of the refresh phase, the threat level and tally of played rounds would be increased by one, where they wouldn’t if the game was won immediately. This results in a difference of 11 Points for scoring, depending on when to end the game.\n\nThanks a lot."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77047-ending-the-game-and-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=745082","commentId":745082,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1357721352,"content":"M4rk0 said:\n\n \n\nHello,\n\nwhen exactly deos the game end?

As soon as you meet the final conditions of the last quest card, the game is over.\n\nEdit: \"If at least one player survives through the completion of the final stage of the scenario, the game ends in a victory for the players.\" p22. Whatever it takes to complete the final stage is the key here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77047-ending-the-game-and-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=745194","commentId":745194,"userName":"mrkwnzl","timestamp":1357736977,"content":"Thanks.\n\nAnd just for clarity: If i'm in my 11th round and complete the quest, I would count only 10 rounds for scoring (resulting in 100 Points).
