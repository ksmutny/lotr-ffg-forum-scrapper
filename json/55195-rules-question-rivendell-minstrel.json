Otherwise, the card would stipulate limitations similar to those on The Eagles are Coming! or Mustering the Rohirrim (\"Search the top X cards of your deck.\"). So, go fetch them tunes!\n\nEdit: More precisely, to achieve the limited search effect you suggested in the second part of your post, the Minstrel's ability would have to be something along the lines of \"Reveal cards from the top of your deck until you reveal a Song. Add that card to your hand, then shuffle the other revealed cards into your deck.\" However, the card imposes no such restrictions, so you have free choice of any Song in your deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55195-rules-question-rivendell-minstrel/?do=findComment&comment=546154","commentId":546154,"userName":"RGun","timestamp":1319378359,"content":"Thanks, that's what I thought.  Makes this card very useful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55195-rules-question-rivendell-minstrel/?do=findComment&comment=546296","commentId":546296,"userName":"gamestar10","timestamp":1319406403,"content":"He's also great to Ride to Ruin...just for giggles :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55195-rules-question-rivendell-minstrel/?do=findComment&comment=546298","commentId":546298,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1319406758,"content":"Ride to ruin only works on Rohan cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55195-rules-question-rivendell-minstrel/?do=findComment&comment=546308","commentId":546308,"userName":"gamestar10","timestamp":1319409854,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nRide to ruin only works on Rohan cards.\n\n\n\nEmbarrassing...\n\nMy thought went straight to Gleowine. :^)"}]}
