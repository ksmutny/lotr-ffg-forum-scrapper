The way it is written implies that you can either declare your own attack against other player's Enemies with your ranged characters or have your ranged characters assist another player when that player attacks. I would say it is an exclusive or though so you can't both assist and declare your own attack against the same enemy. That will prevent you from attacking the same enemy with the same character multiple times in the same turn.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45634-rule-question-multiple-ranged-attacks-in-the-same-turn-against-same-enemy/?do=findComment&comment=457862","commentId":457862,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1303507259,"content":"I rellay like ranged characters (especially Legolas!), they seem quite versatile and powerful, especially in multiplayer.\n\nBasically, any given enemy can be attacked only once by each player. But different players can attack the same enemy (each on his turn if not ranged).\n\nThe ranged characters get to attack out-of-turn, basically assisting the other player's attack.
