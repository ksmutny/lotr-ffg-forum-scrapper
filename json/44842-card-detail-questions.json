It also really fits well into the tactics theme and makes sense to use more than one character. As far as the rules go, I guess it indeed requires three tactics heroes, since only heroes that share a sphere with the card can contribute to its cost.\n\nI think it will be nice in a multiplayer game, where two players will each play a mono-sphere deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44842-card-detail-questions/?do=findComment&comment=449614","commentId":449614,"userName":"YGrams","timestamp":1302033884,"content":" In that same video, you can see two new enemy cards. The first is \"Cavern Guardian\" (8 threat cost, 2 threat, 2 attack, 1 defence, 2 health), whose trait is 'Undead' and who has a keyword 'Doomed 1'. Its shadow effect is that you must discard one attachment you control (discarded objectives are returned to the staging area). If the attack is undefended, you must discard all attachments. It seems to be a part of the Escape from Dol Guldur scenario.\n\nThe second is \"Misty Mountain Goblins\" (15 threat cost, 2 threat, 2 attack, 1 defence, 3 health), whose traits are 'Goblin, Orc' and who has a card text reading 'Forced: After Misty Mountain Goblins attack, remove one progress token from the current quest'. Its shadow effect is to remove one progress token from the current quest, or three is the attack is undefended. Ouch. It looks to be a part of the Journey down the River Anduin scenario."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44842-card-detail-questions/?do=findComment&comment=449657","commentId":449657,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1302048633,"content":"@YGrams:\n\nWow, good eyes!
