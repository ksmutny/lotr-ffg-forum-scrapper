I know he cannot ready to attack the same enemy again in the same round, but what about defending against multiple attacks in the same round or participating in attacks against multiple different enemies in the same round? Are these legal or have I totally been breaking the rules?\n\nThanks for the help!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/137853-afraid-im-overusing-boromir/?do=findComment&comment=1489618","commentId":1489618,"userName":"Trialus","timestamp":1426341430,"content":"Whoops...think I just had my questions answered by the \"two elementary questions\" thread below."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/137853-afraid-im-overusing-boromir/?do=findComment&comment=1505437","commentId":1505437,"userName":"Crabble","timestamp":1427280089,"content":"Also tune in on the tuesday night twitch streams from COTR.
