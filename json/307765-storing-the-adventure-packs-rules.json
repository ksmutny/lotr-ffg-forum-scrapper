I keep the cards in a box, but I want to keep the rules safe in a folder. That way I can throw away the plastic packs. \n\nI first thought to laminate the rules and then punch holes in it to keep it in a folder. But the problem is that the size of the rules sheets is a bit larger than the standard A4-size :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\nDo you have any suggestions? \n\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nGreetings, \n\nJacob"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307765-storing-the-adventure-packs-rules/?do=findComment&comment=3928308","commentId":3928308,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1587115578,"content":"Maybe there's something here or at another American stationer? https://www.amazon.com/clear-plastic-wallet-Binder-Accessories/s?k=clear+plastic+wallet&rh=n%3A490544011 [https://www.amazon.com/clear-plastic-wallet-Binder-Accessories/s?k=clear+plastic+wallet&rh=n%3A490544011]\n\nThe best I could find for you were A3 punch pocket clear plastic wallets.

Therefore, I store all my player cards side on in 3 rows. With dividers for each type of card by sphere. Then each type is alphabetical. \n\nAll of my quest cards are then stored in little clear bags that press shut at the top. (Most of them are from Swan sleeves packets, or packets from FFG that held cards like in the x-wing game. Basically any plastic game bag as long as it's not too big). Each quest is stored in its own bag. If I have the nightmare version, then that goes in the same bag as the quest; with the nightmare pack cover showing as the first card. That way you can store the whole of a cycle and the folded rules sheets into the corresponding deluxe box. \n\nThey sit on my book shelf side on in order.\n\nThe first cycle and all the standalone quests fit into one of the smaller core set boxes. And the whole of a saga (by book) fits into one of the deluxes. I.e. I keep the Black Rider and Road Darkens in the Road Darkens box and so on for all of the sagas. \n\nThat way I don't need folders for cards or rules  I can grab the core box for all my player cards and the deluxe box of the cycle I want to play and every thing is there together.\n\nThis is why I prefer the deluxe box over the arkham horror deluxe box which are flimsy. Glad they finally bought out the return to boxes. \n\nEdited May 13 by asgardianphil\nSilly mistakes"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307765-storing-the-adventure-packs-rules/?do=findComment&comment=3938959","commentId":3938959,"userName":"asgardianphil","timestamp":1589382047,"content":"Although I have all of the cycles, I dont have all of the nightmare packs.
