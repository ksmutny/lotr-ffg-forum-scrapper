So long as the ranged character does not belong to the player declaring attacks it can participate in that players attacks with his/her characters. So as long as the character controlling Eomer is the one declaring attacks, the other player who controls legolas can declare him as an attacker against the same enemy as Eomer as a participant in that attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120958-two-player-attacking/?do=findComment&comment=1247311","commentId":1247311,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1409821381,"content":">  \n> \n> > If one has ranged they can\n> \n>  \n> \n> I think you mean that both players can attack the same enemy if the non-defending player has ranged attackers, but player 1's attackers would not be able to attack the common foe/same enemy at the same time as player 2's (ranged) attackers.

You're right! I misread the \"ranged\" keyword rules in the core rulebook by only allowing the ranged player to attack on his own turn… but that means I only made it harder for us to beat certain enemies and quests, not easier, so I don't feel bad.\n\nEdited September 4, 2014 by TwiceBornh"}]}
