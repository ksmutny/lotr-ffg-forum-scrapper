That is so harsh!\n\nShould I just forget about attachments and go all-in with allies and events?\n\nOr are attachments the key, letting us buff a single hero to the point where it can kill a troll in 1 or 2 turns?\n\nWhat works for you?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298364-hobbit-saga-man-this-is-hard/?do=findComment&comment=3755027","commentId":3755027,"userName":"Hannibal_pjv","timestamp":1564869347,"content":"It is hard!

It can be a little tricky/annoying to get the treasure (which are by no means nessessary, but are a nice boost).\n\nIf killing the trolls seems to hard, try just full on questing through. I think it's even harder to get the treasure with this method though.\n\nAs Wandalf said: Prepare a way to one or twoshot the troll preventing multiple attackers. E.g. a wounded Gimli, further buffed with some events (Durin's Song, Heavy Stroke etc.) or an Erebor battlemaster (I'd ignore the errata, when playing progression style). Just be careful with amassing allies, when you have no way to avoid treacheries as roast em or boil em can really weaken the power of batlemasters."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298364-hobbit-saga-man-this-is-hard/?do=findComment&comment=3755118","commentId":3755118,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1564878712,"content":"I'm not sure what your card pool is like but another way around the quest is to clear the encounter deck. It's harder to swing with all the trolls in play but if you can get a swarm going and take the hits without losing too much willpower, you can wait it out. I would definitely recommend holding on to one or maybe even two at a time, if you can keep your threat low enough, and just quest through.\n\nAnother trick if you have it... \n\nPlay sting, the guarded card. Theres only a couple crows in the deck, and it must attach to an enemy. You could theoretically clear out a huge chunk of the deck searching for them. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298364-hobbit-saga-man-this-is-hard/?do=findComment&comment=3755350","commentId":3755350,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1564918683,"content":"A trick I haven't seen mentioned yet is the following. Gandalf is immune to all of the sacked cards. So make him your main character and load him up for Troll killing fun. I recommend a low threat build with the new Gandalf Ally that comes in the same box. Throw all of his attachments on him (staff, ring, horse) and he becomes a monster.\n\nAnother good option is bringing Eleanor my third favourite hero in the game who single-handedly saves you from that game ending \"discard all non-treasure attachments\". Especially in solo she is great since it's incredibly rare to draw that card again as the replacement one. She is a lifesaver in quests with bad treacheries.\n\nAlso you really want to get and leave troll camp in play and never spend Bilbo's resources so you can free your characters.\n\nHere is the solo deck I beat it with:\n\nhttps://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/12768/arrowsinthedark20-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/12768/arrowsinthedark20-1.0]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298364-hobbit-saga-man-this-is-hard/?do=findComment&comment=3755459","commentId":3755459,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1564934855,"content":"I've been trying to play the Hobbit saga thematically (dwarves).  Do you think it would be easier if I ignore the theme and pick a set of heroes (and allies) that is more flexible?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298364-hobbit-saga-man-this-is-hard/?do=findComment&comment=3755635","commentId":3755635,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1564957365,"content":"Access to spirit would be good, at least, even if you stick with Dwarves. Throughout the whole hobbit saga, the treacheries make every quest pretty “swingy” since many of them can be game-ending. If you happen not to draw them, the quests are fairly “puzzle like” and straightforward to defeat. But if you haven’t planned for those treacheries or have bad luck and get hit multiple times with them, you might as well start over."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298364-hobbit-saga-man-this-is-hard/?do=findComment&comment=3755645","commentId":3755645,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1564959534,"content":"I'm playing 2 handed (Leadership/Lore and Spirit/Tactics), so have already been including Will of the West (x3) and Dwarven Tomb, but I see how Eleanor would be an even more consistent way to prevent some of those engine-killing treacheries.\n\nHowever, Eleanor means \"breaking\" the Dwarf theme, which would probably motivate me to rebuild both decks from scratch.  I don't actually mind the idea of moving away from Dwarves for a while (since I played them all the way through Khazad Dum and Dwarrowdelf), but there seem to be 3 reasons to stick with Dwarves:\n\n1) purely thematic (The Hobbit is all about Dwarven heroes)\n\n2)  most of the new cards in The Hobbit saga seem to be Dwarf-centric, so it would be nice to try those out\n\n3)  I don't know of a better archetype at this point in my card Pool (progression style)\n\nThose 3 reasons have been motivating me to stick with a pair of Dwarf-centric decks. \n\nHowever, if the rest of the Hobbit saga has lots of other \"swingy treacheries\", then I don't mind leaving the Dwarves behind, at least for the duration of the saga.\n\n \n\nI did have another question: If I stick with Dwarves, but replace most of the attachments with more allies, is it better to use high-cost Dwarf allies (since I'm already using all the cheap ones) or cheap non-Dwarf allies (like Snowborne Scout)?  Does a \"Dwarf swarm\" deck typically also include some non-Dwarven allies, or is the idea to limit it to Dwarves (so that they all benefit from Dain's bonuses)?\n\nEdited August 4, 2019 by tripecac"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298364-hobbit-saga-man-this-is-hard/?do=findComment&comment=3755651","commentId":3755651,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1564960443,"content":"> 7 hours ago, tripecac said:\n> \n> I've been trying to play the Hobbit saga thematically (dwarves).  Do you think it would be easier if I ignore the theme and pick a set of heroes (and allies) that is more flexible?\n\nGandalf and Legolas are pretty thematic haha"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298364-hobbit-saga-man-this-is-hard/?do=findComment&comment=3755874","commentId":3755874,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1564984984,"content":"Maybe the best idea is to sleeve Eleanor, draw a beard on her on the sleeve, and rename her Dis.
