With a single core set, the predominant strategy for this scenario appears to be to start with a really low threat so you can build up an army to take the troll before he engages, so that when he does engage, you're ready for him. With the Tactics and Leadership starters, you have a starting threat of 29 which buys you one extra round, and the Lore starter has the troll engaging during round one. Spirit, on the other hand, is hard-pressed to round up the attack strength necessary to take the troll out. The main point: you really need to build a multi-sphere deck to beat this quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60587-journey-down-the-anduin-lore-starter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=595409","commentId":595409,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1329485069,"content":"Budgernaut said:\n\nThe main point: you really need to build a multi-sphere deck to beat this quest.\n\n\n\n \n\nand most of the following..............."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60587-journey-down-the-anduin-lore-starter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=595430","commentId":595430,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1329487332,"content":" With the Lore starter deck you'd be looking at getting a sacrificial Ally out in Turn 1, and then Forest Snaring the Troll in turn 2.  Or get Protector of Lorien on Denethor in turn 1 to defend and Forest Snare turn 2."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60587-journey-down-the-anduin-lore-starter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=595441","commentId":595441,"userName":"dcdennis","timestamp":1329488370,"content":"scottindeed said:\n\n With the Lore starter deck you'd be looking at getting a sacrificial Ally out in Turn 1, and then Forest Snaring the Troll in turn 2.  Or get Protector of Lorien on Denethor in turn 1 to defend and Forest Snare turn 2.\n\n\n\n \n\nThis is the tact that I have been taking but I thought I must be doing something wrong.

As mentioned above, the trick to taking it solo is to use multiple spheres. Have you read the recent news articles about deck construction? I don't know how familiar you are with deck-building games, but those articles helped me. I was able to beat Anduin with a Spirit/Tactics deck, though my win:loss ratio is really low. But that was using only cards from the core set, so there's hope!\n\nAs far as being disappointed with FFG for making a product that needs other expansions, well, I don't know if I'd go that far, but I still haven't beat Escape from Dol Guldur yet."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60587-journey-down-the-anduin-lore-starter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=595849","commentId":595849,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1329606114,"content":"Yeah, I've learned that the \"starter decks\" (i.e. pure sphere decks) are only appropriate for the \"starter\" quest, Passage through Mirkwood.  Past that you'll need to do your own deck building, and this is entirely possible with just the cards in the core set (that's all I've got).  I've played Anduin three times in a 2-player game and beaten it twice (haven't won yet solo, but I haven't tried all that much).\n\nFirst time we won, we did it by the skin of our teeth.  I had a mixed tactics/spirit deck with Thalin, Dunhere and Eowyn, while my partner had a mixed leadership/lore with Theodred, Gloin and Beravor.\n\nWe just won again tonight, and this time we trounced the thing.  I was playing a tactics/lore with Thalin, Legolas and Denethor, while my partner had spirit/leadership with Theodred, Eowyn and Dunhere.  Luck paced the encounter deck to only one new enemy per round, which I think helped us immensely.  We also had good draws.  My partner got a ton of allies out, including the ever-useful Northern Tracker and Lorien Guide.  I had almost nothing in the way of allies, but got some great events and attachments, including 2 feints, a citadel plate and both forest snares.\n\nDeck building is fun, so give it a try!  Just make sure you can pay for the cards you are putting in your deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] (i.e. don't put Beorn in your deck if you only have 1 tactics hero!)\n\nGS"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60587-journey-down-the-anduin-lore-starter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=595885","commentId":595885,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1329616736,"content":"Audin is not a problem to beat with a single copy of core.

I find it was to unwieldy, and with out the \"table talk\" rule way way to easy playing with both hands open. I think rich is right, for me it is slow and lame playing that way .. I think the \"true\" solo mode is fine in most cases, though there are some glaring exceptions, namely aJTR and RTM. Though I think that just like Escape from Dol Goldor is now able to be beating with relative ease (still hard) and Massing is now in the high % win ratios (all due to ziggy), I am confident that eventually as the card pool matures these quests will become much better for solo. Then, of course, making the deck to own those quest will be all the sweeter!"}]}
