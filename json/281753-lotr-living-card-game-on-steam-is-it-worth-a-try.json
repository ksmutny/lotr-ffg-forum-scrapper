Windows does have tablets that may run it if you have a mouse as I don't think they have enabled touch inputs. Laptop/desktop/tablet form factor doesn't really matter as long as the insides are powerful enough to run it. I run it on my desktop just fine, and stream it to my older laptop via Steam streaming. I haven't actually given it a try on my Windows tablet though so maybe I'll do so this weekend. The tablet runs Hearthstone so it should run this.   \n\nAndroid/iOs tablets are out of luck, at least at this point in Early Access. I know those are the most popular \"tablets\" in the market so most people think of those when talking about that form factor, but this early in the digital games life it's worth making sure everyone is clear on what it will and won't run on."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281753-lotr-living-card-game-on-steam-is-it-worth-a-try/?do=findComment&comment=3457346","commentId":3457346,"userName":"JasonRed3","timestamp":1535772098,"content":"I must say, it's a big disingenuous to continue labeling it as a \"Living Card Game\" when it's most definitely collectible.  There are packs and card rarities.  It's a CCG.\n\n \n\nAlso, it's a completely different game.  Completely.\n\n \n\nNot saying that I'm not enjoying it, but the thought of trading in my physical cards for this is a complete joke.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281753-lotr-living-card-game-on-steam-is-it-worth-a-try/?do=findComment&comment=3457411","commentId":3457411,"userName":"TheSpitfired","timestamp":1535784360,"content":"It is very different, but interesting.

Easy money, and it would keep people like me playing instead of deleting and probably forgetting about it until long after release.\n\nThat first line is quite the claim.  The last line too. If they simply through more heroes and didn't improve/diversify the gameplay and released it, I would immediately drop the game. As it is the only reason I still pay attention to it is because it's in early access and I see potential but it's clearly not there yet (and not just due to lack of content).\n\nI love the change to hard mode and rather hope that they move it to all modes. It's not because 'LotR' should feel some way, it's because as a card game I feel like the game was far too generous with cards (especially given the max deck size) to the point where without putting a single card draw card in my deck, I'd draw my entire deck (or only not draw my entire deck because the game doesn't let you draw if your hand is full and I have no reason to play cards). I'd say that under the old system, you'd actively be making your deck worse by putting card draw cards in (unless you were running a -really- low curve) it because those cards do nothing by themselves, they decease the total amount of strength in your deck (which is relevant when you draw your whole deck) and you were pretty much never in need of more cards anyway. My only concern with the change is that at the moment your card draw options are Gandalf or Lore and Lore already was one of the most essential spheres but I'd much rather they try to solve the content problem of balancing out lore than the economy problem that drawing two cards per turn was causing.\n\nI would also strongly be in favor of making more of each spheres essential/best cards not available with one hero of a sphere (which would probably be what you consider crippling tri-sphere decks) but again, this is not because as LotR game 'should' be some way but because it would be an immense waste of a system if they don't change it. Right now, forgoing having at least one hero in any of the four spheres (let alone more than one) denies you access to many of the best cards in the game and doubling up on heros of a sphere rarely gives you access to anything interesting. If they don't change this, then the whole ability to double up on heroes of a sphere  to get access to new cards will be as wasted as if in Magic rather than having mana of different colors, you instead just had mana and could choose 2 colors at the start of the game and you could only play cards that were those two colors. It would work, it could still be a decent game, but it misses a great deal of the potential depth and variety that could be leant to it by the system it has now.\n\nEdited September 14, 2018 by Velensk"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281753-lotr-living-card-game-on-steam-is-it-worth-a-try/?do=findComment&comment=3470752","commentId":3470752,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1536958386,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Velensk said:\n> \n> I feel like the game was far too generous with cards (especially given the max deck size) to the point where without putting a single card draw card in my deck, I'd draw my entire deck (or only not draw my entire deck because the game doesn't let you draw if your hand is full and I have no reason to play cards).\n\nI completely fail to see why this is an actual problem.

Everyone build their decks to get through their decks asap in the first place, cutting out the middleman of playing cards to draw cards is simply good design work.\n\nThere are two problems.\n\nThe first is that there is a difference between a player doing something and the game doing something. In that sense, your argument is similar to saying that since everyoned plays Diablo to slay Diablo, everyone should start right in front of Diablo with a character that can slay Diablo so that they can slay diablo without needing to go through a middleman.\n\nThe second, is that stategically, it's not always true. There are very few card games in this style I know of where the only viable approach to playing revolves entirely around drawing cards. Granted, in many of these style of games, longer term strategies will tend to mandate a card advantage engine of sorts going but even then there's a distinction between having ways to get more cards and 'building your deck to get through your deck asap' which would generally be the venue of extreme cases or combo decks reliant on digging through their deck for a specific set of cards. In any case, the amount and type of card draw a deck chooses to add is a strategic choice and will vary depending on the game plan of the deck.\n\nAs it currently stands on normal mode. Card draw of any kind is a weak or even counterproductive choice because the game will simply give you more cards than you need (again, unless your deck is running a very low curve). Like the current state of the sphere system, this is a waste of potential depth as there's a lot of potentially interesting options that simply aren't appealing enough to warrant consideration.\n\n> 3 hours ago, Edheliad said:\n> \n> I'm sure they'll add more cards that need two heroes as the game grows.

It's not \"missing a great deal of potential depth\" it's approaching the idea of spheres from the other direction.\n\nSince I'm talking about depth, I might as well define exactly what I mean as this will also factor into the sphere discussion.\n\nWhen I speak of the depth of a game, I am referring to the amount the play of that game can be digged into and developed. The play of a strategy game is by and large about the choices you make with regard to how to achieve an objective in a system that has uncertainty but which follows predictable patterns that can be discerned and planned around. This being the case, the depth of a strategy games comes from why one might make one choice over another and the difficulty of selecting an optimum choice (relative to the goal) given the uncertainty. I'm going to note that 'depth' defined this way doesn't actually require there be many options (that would be breadth) merely that there be a lot that goes into making the decisions.\n--It's also important to note, that a discussion of depth somewhat requires a set defined objective as the considerations of the decision are relative to the objective it is made towards. Games conveniently tend to have set win conditions which can make things easier, but if one person is talking about the game with just the idea that they want to make it to the end of a scenario and another is talking about their personal quest to get a high score with a 'three hunters' deck, some things won't translate over when we talk about depth (among other things, a discussion on why you'd choose one hero over another). \n--Players can put themselves under any number of challenges which might make the game harder, most of these actually simplify the game rather than give it more depth (as normally the challenges are limitations). The challenges that actually improve the depth of the game are usually ones where there is an known strongest course of action in the game and the given limitation makes that option not a viable one while leaving several other viable options of unknown relative strength on the table.\n--For this discussion, I'll be assuming that the goal is simply to 'win', though I expect for most players it's to maximize score (which contributes to lore and spirit feeling somewhat indispensable right now but we'll leave that issue).\n\nOne thing the tabletop game does extremely well, is always making it so that there are a wide variety of very strong decks that are all strong in different situations but all very much punishable by scenarios designed for it. This keeps the decision of how to build your deck interesting and the answer constantly changing. Granted, over time a few extra strong decks that can handle almost anything have appeared but that's really hard to prevent given the age of the game and the 'all cards legal' format. Even with them existing though, its still rather fun to find new ways to do things because the complexity of the game allows for such a variety of viable approaches. This is what I would describe as depth and the DCG currently does not have it. I do not think that given the direction it is going, that it will get it just because more content is added.\n\nI am in no way worried that they won't add more cards/scenarios, I'm worried that as they add them they'll be building on a faulty foundation where either it won't matter, or they'll have to completely throw out their current standards of balance in an extreme way to make it work. This is an concern with the current content (as opposed to the system) and I am aware that it's easy to change the content but if they don't change it I foresee problems (and I can't tell you how many times I've seen designs in FF card games that look like a bit of testing should uncover that there was an issue but obviously it wasn't changed before it went into production and now a part of the games foundation to the point where it's not practical to errata).\n\nMy problem with the current content, is that currently the incentives are so lopsided, that it's not an interesting decision assuming you are optimizing to win and that doesn't look like it's going to change without taking an extreme turn on the content design. Right now, a trisphere decks can not just have access but be really strong in the things each of it's spheres provides  and effectively have no weaknesses (other than perhaps a slight weakness in whatever the fourth sphere would provide it, and since leadership and tactics provide similar things at the moment, there's not really any reason to be lacking anything)\n--Let me put it this way, Spirit is a great sphere, it has some great cards. It's got a near monopoly on threat reduction (and should by design always have the best threat reduction), renewable action advantage, and plenty of questing power. However, spirit is lacking more than a little in combat power which is an somewhat essential element to any deck (at least until we get a scenario with very limited combat). Now with even one tactics hero, you have access to all kinds of great combat allies and attachments that can more than cover up your lack of combat weakness without hindering your ability to use good spirit cards (though if you want, with just one tactics hero you could make your deck entirely out of tactics cards and you'd still get to use the spirit heroes). Given the option to splash one tactics hero and cover up this glaring weakness in your deck (let alone whatever weaknesses come from lacking lore and leadership), what kinds of level 3 spirit cards would have to exist that would make it a compelling option to go with mono-spirit as opposed to splashing even just one tactics hero? I'd say that given the cards currently in the game, spirit has some of the best level 2 cards and it's still not enough to make me want to run two spirit heros as I can already get everything I want from spirit with just a single hero, the same way I can already get everything I want from tactics with just one tactics hero or from any other sphere. What might that level 3 spirit card provide me that would be distinctly spirit, that I cannot already get with lower level spirit cards, and would make up for not having any other sphere?\n\nMy assertion is, that in order to make it so that tri-color decks are not always significantly stronger than all other options they need to make sure one of two things is true. The first one is simple but the second will take some discussion.\n\nThe first approach is that higher level cards need to generally be more desirable than lower level cards of the same sphere. Not that every higher level card needs to be more generally desirable but they need to actively be incentives to be worth sacrificing for (and the better the level 1 cards of each sphere are, the more of a sacrifice it will be to lose access to any sphere). Right now, all the best cards in the game are level 1, so either the future level 2+3 cards will need to better than all the cards that currently exist (better than round shield, self preservation, unexpected courage, and all the great allies in the game) or the stuff currently available at level 1 needs to get worse/be made higher level\n \nAlternatively, the game needs to be more designed in such a way, that being sufficiently good at one thing will make it so that you do not need to be as good at other things. This is largely the approach that the tabletop game takes. If you're sufficiently good at questing and can keep your threat low, you might not have to fight as much. If you're sufficiently good at fighting, you can take the tough enemies in the staging area sooner and might not have to quest as hard. If you're really good at getting resources/cards you might not need any of those individual resources/cards to do as well at fighting or questing.\n--At the moment, this is to some extent true for the digital game as well, however there is a caveat that this is only really true if you're just trying to win. If you're trying to score well, you need to be good at keeping your health high, your threat low, clearing hazards, loading up on fate, while still having strong enough combat to clear the mission. Specializing in any two or three of those at the expense of the others will compromise your score.\n--Even then though, the game is designed in such a way that it's still more necessary to be good at everything. The tactics and spirit spheres in particular are cripplingly overspecialized. With all the tactics cards in the game right now, you could not get a character with 2 willpower and being unable to reuse characters or place progress in any way, could only hope to chip down on any kind of hazard objective (and forget any hope of saving up for expensive fate events). Spirit is a touch more flexible given that some fate events do help with combat and Eowyn has 2 attack (and be given attachments that'll let her act twice) but with the amount of combat in all existing scenarios it'd still be a rough time.\n\n--------------\n\nAfter all that complaining, I'll still acknowledge the possibility that they'll come up with some amazing content design that will lend some depth of the game and make it worthwhile to try a variety of strategies but I don't feel like that's the direction they are headed. After they unlocked all the scenarios, I flattened them all on hard using the exact same deck (and that deck wasn't that different than that of the very first deck I built with just the starter cards, I'd just swapped a few of the valor cards I'd unlocked in). Honestly, it was kind of repetitive. Since then, I've tried other approaches but none of them have worked as well and it was still repetitive. I don't care to make up arbitrary challenges to make the game harder and I don't see any other approach becoming more effective without a serious shakeup.\n\n \n\nEDITED one of the examples to be simpler.\n\nEdited September 15, 2018 by Velensk\nclarity of example"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281753-lotr-living-card-game-on-steam-is-it-worth-a-try/?do=findComment&comment=3471226","commentId":3471226,"userName":"me1034","timestamp":1537000823,"content":"So, ummm..

The tutorial really lack useful information...\n\nI also agree with Velenks that the card pool is too good for one hero per sphere characters and too bad for multiple heroes of one sphere.

The more I think about it, the more correct I think you are (on that point). My comments about spheres and card draw were based around potential as a card game but on the idea of what a LotR game should be, I think it's exactly right that just surviving and overcoming that challenge should feel like an accomplishment by itself. I do hope that they do not orient their difficulty around the idea that a win isn't a win unless you get 250 points (whatever those are) on top of it.\n\n--Changing the focus would also definitely make the spheres feel more balanced against each other as it's not that Tactics/leadership can't win in crushing fashion with complete control of the board, it's that it's really hard for them to come out as pristinely low on threat, free of bruises, and with all the hazards/fate events under their belts. But those things are really supposed to be tactical decisions and priories not things you do even if they don't help you in the slightest because it improves your score at the end of the game."}]}
