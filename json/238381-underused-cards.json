I tried putting it in a deck with Silver Lamp. It's still tricky because you need to be engaged with two enemies, 1 of which has enough attack to kill the other - otherwise you aren't gaining much action advantage. Also, it's an event, so it's hard to build around.\n\n \n\nWhat are your favourite underused cards?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2566408","commentId":2566408,"userName":"flightmaster101","timestamp":1483214246,"content":"Being a solo player there are soooo many cool cards I can't even think about using because they aren't efficient enough for a solo game.\n\nMostly costly (non leadership, non silvan) allies come to mind like Anborn, and Elfhelm."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2566410","commentId":2566410,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1483214324,"content":"Oh man, Small Target would totally be at the top of my list.  Such a fun concept, but near impossible to execute.\n\n \n\nGreat Yew Bow would be another one.  The ideal target is Lore Faramir, but his threat is so high and he's out of sphere that it never really works.  The fact that it doesn't work with Bard's ability is a travesty.  Plus, now Haldir basically does the same thing.\n\n \n\nI might put Strider in that category.  You can kind of make it work, but I haven't been able to make a 2 hero deck that was as effective as a comparable 3 hero deck.\n\n \n\nMy favorite underused card that I have actually gotten to work is Keeping Count.  You need a ton of card draw to make it work, but it can be bananas when it gets online."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2566429","commentId":2566429,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1483215386,"content":"> The fact that it doesn't work with Bard's ability is a travesty\n\n \n\nI'm pretty sure it does work with Bard doesn't it?

Minas Tirith Lampwright\n\nI absolutely love this guy for being one of only two player cards that actually interact with the surge mechanic. He was released back in Heirs of Numenor, and somehow remains the only true counter to surge. He's fantastic: fun art, low cost, and stats so pitiful that they become endearing. But I've only ever included him in a deck with the Palantir (another underused card), using him as fodder for Eomer and Imrahil, or when playing across from a friend using Risk Some Light. I so badly want him to be good. I want this kind of card to supplant the tyrannical rule of Test of Will! He's risky and inefficient, but when he shuts down a card it's the best feeling. But I'll continue to sing his praises, even if he consistently discards himself after mistaking a mountain for a troll. He's like the boy who cried wolf. \n\n \n\n2. Lanwyn, Bard, Brand and all the Dale-folk\n\nI like Lanwyn for much the same reason I like the Lampwright. She isn't a direct counter to surge, but she is the only hero that stands up to that most annoying of keywords. I like Bard for his raw power and the fun that can be had by coupling him with Straight Shot or Firefoot. I like Brand because he was there for me back in those early days, readying my friend's heroes and staring directly at the sun. And yet I almost never use them...\n\nThe sad truth is that these three heroes have terrible trait support. Scout is becoming a more and more useful trait, so Lanwyn has that going for her. But Dale? It isn't even a real trait. Hey Brand, enjoy all the weapons and abilities that come with being King of the Dale! And then Bard doesn't even share the Dale trait with his grandson. He has the only Esgaroth trait in the game, but at least he has Warrior to make him feel better. \n\nBeing a Dale hero grants you access to nothing, and there are only three Dale allies to muster. I really like the Rhovanian Outrider, but I can't say I've ever used the Ravenhill Scout or the Celduin Traveler. If the next cycle after Harad doesn't visit and/or support Dale, then I'll be very disappointed that this trait was never given a fair chance.\n\n \n\n3. Thror's Key\n\nNot much to say here. I just love this thing and can't understand why I don't run it more often. Sure, it's not crazy good, but I'm always happy when it triggers (I'm looking at you Outlying Homestead). \n\n \n\n4. Revealed in Wrath\n\nThis is mainly underused because it's still a rather new card. It also isn't an auto-include general purpose card. But it is super fun to shut down certain enemies, especially when used by Arwen or Galdor. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2570215","commentId":2570215,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1483515798,"content":"> Cards I really like but just seem to fall short of being worth the slot are Idraen, Lanwyn, Rossiel, Defender of the West and The White Council.  \n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> > 4  Lanwyn:   I thought when we saw the first Ranged hero ever in Spirit that things were about to get crazy.  So far, she has not been popular.  Even less popular than the considerably worse Rossiel hero, who came out at about the same time.\n> \n>  \n> \n> 4: Agreed - we need more support cards around surge, including a way to give a card surge to gain a benefit.\n\n \n\nLanwyn is actual my most likly hero.

Since the phase doesn't end until all players have addressed combat, it seems like combat would proceed to the left until that is the case. In fact, in the worst interpretation, the initial 1st player may have to resolve combat twice if they are to the left of the final 1st player but before the last player.\n\n \n\nObviously that makes no sense, and neither does any of these exploits. That being said, I still struggle to find uses for it that justify deck space. I suppose often a Leadership/Tactics deck wants to engage more enemies, and therefore might want to be 1st player during the engagement phase, but realistically there are much better ways of engaging enemies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2571912","commentId":2571912,"userName":"dr00","timestamp":1483586048,"content":"> > Cards I really like but just seem to fall short of being worth the slot are Idraen, Lanwyn, Rossiel, Defender of the West and The White Council.\n> \n>  \n> \n> \n> \n> > > 4  Lanwyn:   I thought when we saw the first Ranged hero ever in Spirit that things were about to get crazy.  So far, she has not been popular.  Even less popular than the considerably worse Rossiel hero, who came out at about the same time.\n> > \n> > 4: Agreed - we need more support cards around surge, including a way to give a card surge to gain a benefit.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Lanwyn is actual my most likly hero.

Free Emery + Sword-thain with the help of Arwen's resource, and then use Caldara's ability to bring 3 spirit heroes for free into the table (Glorfindel, Northern Tracker, Háma, Prince Imrahil, Elfhelm, Rhovanion Outrider, and Jubayr -once The Mûmakil is released- to name some options), all this during round 1"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2574782","commentId":2574782,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1483728214,"content":"You think that first turns like that are just daydreams about perfect draws until you play a Caldara/Arwen deck and regularly do silly things in the first 2 turns."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2575146","commentId":2575146,"userName":"jjenks476","timestamp":1483741906,"content":"Is there much value in it besides in a caldara deck?

I feel like there's the ability there for some pretty remarkable power plays, but you'd have to build for it and it would be situational. Charge of the Rohirrim, We Do Not Sleep, For Gondor!\n\ndon't forget Eomund\n\nbut i agree with you. even with things like Leadership Boromir, Visionary Leadership, For Gondor! (which is only ok on its own)\n\nas someone who's spent a fair bit of time trying to make this work, i think you end up doing is making a rohan deck that works pretty well and has to include 3 copies of mutual accord, then a gondor deck (again, 3 copies), but the gondor synergy just isn't really there yet. there's no discount card for them. there's steward of gondor and L-Denethor, but those aren't really gondor-specific\n\nthere's literally no synergy across spheres from Spirit or Lore, so you're kind of stuck with leadership/tactics, which have a lot of great valour options, but in that instance, t-Boromir is kind of pulling more weight than L-Boromir (imo)\n\nbasically, it's kind of a mess making a decent gondor-themed deck that wouldn't be better as something else because the gondor theme doesn't mesh well with itself as compared to others. that's why mutual accord doesn't really work imo\n\n\n\n> Is there much value in it besides in a caldara deck?

Not a reliable plan, but it works.\n\ni suppose that would be the living-the-dream-est living the dream play ever considering you need to have Azain to be in the top 5 cards of your deck and THEN have Sword-Thain in the top 2 cards of your deck after a shuffle\n\nWell-equipped isn't too much of a hassle, you just need it in your hand. you could set up one piece with, say, Wizard Pipe, so maybe just get Sword-Thain and Well-equipped in your hand and keep using Imrahil until you pull a dwarf, then finish the combo. don't think it's worth all the trouble though lol\n\nalso it would work with To Me! O My Kinsfolk!, but again, it's like a 3 card combo for what exactly? and getting Sword-Thain out for free requires even more cards (as explained above). it's probably really cool and fun when it happens, but i would imagine the encounter deck is running amok while you're waiting for all the pieces\n\nthis is why it works so well with Caldara. it makes Map of Earnil cheaper, gives more willpower for Pelargir Shipwright, and gives you another ally from the discard with Caldara's ability, and that ability makes it so worth it cos you're getting some high-cost allies into play for free\n\ni think it's really hard for any other deck to compete with that right now. a mono-Lore deck with Mithrandir's Advice and Scroll of Isildur comes close, but it's probably lacking a few other synergistic pieces\n\ncards that benefit from having more heroes\n\nLeadership\n\nIngold (+1 willpower if your Sword-Thain target has 1 resource)\n\nLegacy of Numenor (+1 resource)\n\nRear Guard (still not worth it though)\n\nTighten Our Belts (+1 resource)\n\nTome of Atanatar (reduces cost down to a possible 0)\n\nTactics\n\nBook of Eldecar (reduces cost down to a possible 0)\n\nForth Eorlingas! (if Rohan and if you need another hero for this attack)\n\nSpirit\n\nInspiring Presence (they have no threat cost, so they'd invariably get the extra bonuses)\n\nMap of Earnil (already mentioned)\n\nPelargir Shipwright (already mentioned)\n\nSmoke Rings (actually kind of cool, and we're getting new pipes soon. just hope they can be equipped on Hobbits or it might not be worth it to go down this route)\n\nLore\n\nBeorn's Hospitality (can heal another hero... still probably isn't worth it playing this card at any rate)\n\nGaladhrim Healer (same as above. probably isn't worth justifying the combo, but Galadhrim Healer is pretty awesome in her own right)\n\nMirlonde (but the effect doesn't matter, and doesn't even combo with Loragorn cos that wasn't your starting threat)\n\nMithrandir's Advice (probably the coolest use of it: +1 one card)\n\nScroll of Isildur (reduces cost down to a possible 0; can be used to play more Mithrandir's Advice)\n\nalso In the Shadows and Take no Notice, but you can already reduce them to 0 by having 3 Hobbit/Ranger heroes\n\nNeutral\n\nJustice Shall be Done (3 more resources before you flame out, but at the cost of 4...)\n\nFellowship\n\nFellowship of the Ring (gives you one more willpower by virtue of this new hero you have)\n\nFrodo's Intuition (gives you one more willpower and one more drawn card if you Sword-thain a Hobbit)\n\nTreebeard and Radaghast would be cool since they have built-in abilities for those resources (and collect some of their own), but they don't belong to a sphere of influence and therefore aren't eligible targets\n\nalso some upcoming cards in The Black Serpent (but i won't really comment on them to preserve spoilers)\n\nwith Leadership, all you're doing is mitigating the tempo loss by getting more resources from some effects (which Sword-thain is already doing), and Ingold is basically even more of a tempo loss since you need to hold another resource in reserve\n\nTactics has barely anything\n\nSpirit is pretty much all banking on Caldara\n\nLore looks pretty nice with Mithrandir's Advice though\n\nthere's probably a decent multisphere Hobbit Sword-thain deck out there. hopefully they can get another equipable pipe\n\nand of course you can simply make any ally a hero and load them up with hero-only attachments and even have an extra hero to soak up undefended attacks, but Sword-thain is 4 resources. there are other ways to help with that and most of the combos aren't really all that powerful or necessary"}]}
