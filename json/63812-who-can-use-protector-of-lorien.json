From p. 23 of the rule book:\n\n\"Actions are always optional, and can be triggered by their controller during any action window in the game sequence.\" [emphasis mine]\n\nNote that Eowyn, who has a somewhat similar effect, expressly states that any player may trigger her ability. In general, though, you must control a card to use its Action: effects.\n\nIn your example, if you attach PoL to her hero, only your wife can trigger its ability (since you automatically give her control of the attachment when you play it on one of her heroes)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63812-who-can-use-protector-of-lorien/?do=findComment&comment=624359","commentId":624359,"userName":"Zoso","timestamp":1335835852,"content":"Thanks!!
