The Harbor master clarification was between moving and adding, moving isn't adding was all I got from that clarification. I have seen discussion elsewhere on if resourceful works with harbor master as that is also collecting. \n\n \n\nThough I guess it doesn't matter much as your intention is for it not to work with collecting, as this card and harbor master are the only two cards that work like that anyway.\n\n \n\nOn a minor note Firefoot refers to Arod, I'm guessing that is just a minor copypasta error. I like most of the rest of the cards, rather cool ideas.\n\n \n\nAlso is keen eyed took meant to stack? +15 engagement cost on engaged monster would make it quite a mainstay for any deck relying on being lower threat then the enemies for their abilities.\n\nEdited February 1, 2016 by Davachido"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200941-lotr-lcg-overhaul-001/?do=findComment&comment=2026313","commentId":2026313,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1454355108,"content":"I guess I had myself fooled, after closely studying the FAQ I found no clear distinction between collecting and adding, so I'll implement a little change into the Steward by making it triggering exclusively from other heroes getting a resource added to them, excluding the attached one. \n\n \n\nAnd thanks for the typo, I'll add the fix to my ever growing \"Pending\" card folder :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"}]}
