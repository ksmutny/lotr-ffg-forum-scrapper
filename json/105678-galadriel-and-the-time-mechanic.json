Still off the preview thread, I wanted to discuss one thing. With Galadriel, we have got the first hero who can reduce threat repeatedly in every round. I believe it is a mile-stone of sorts, and fitting for such an iconic hero. In solo play this can easily lead to much stalling, if one really wants to. Thus, the time mechanic seems very appropriate again, something that perhaps should have existed from the beginning. Of course the raising of the threat works in a similar way, but only unless you find effective ways to mitigate the rise.\n\n \n\nMuch has already been said about Galadriel herself, and much will be before she officially arrives. Together with Celeborn, Silvan allies will become very powerful having all-round boosted stats (save hp which may still cause problems) and double use on the first round. The returning events and proper resource management will be key to the strategy, I feel. And the best thing about it, the whole idea is not straight-forward, one might be faced with many interesting decisions, including Galadriel herself. Of course you can play UC on her but unless she has Neny, you would be wasting resources. Even after the Ring, Silvan might be more than capable of questing enough without the support of the Lady. For me, the very important aspect of Nenya is that it gives the Lore icon, as neither Celeborn or Galadriel are Lore but the Silvan allies often are.\n\nEdited May 7, 2014 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105678-galadriel-and-the-time-mechanic/?do=findComment&comment=1075307","commentId":1075307,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1399452673,"content":"I mostly agree.

One card is not too much. But even if you do not have Nenya, she still draws a card and lowers threat. As I said above, for solo play this is incredibly useful. I tried her out as a proxy already last night, and against some of the older quests, even the harder ones like Massing at Osgiliath, I could just keep the threat at opening level, pretty much. What is even more important however, is the \"keeping ready\" ability. I think it is invaluable, especially with the Silvan. Celeborn turns any Silvan into a useful quester and fighter, and Galadriel makes them be both in the round they come into play. Silvan Refugee is 3 willpower quester who stays in play to chump block or contribute 1 attack -- all that for 1 resource. Henamarth Riversong is 2 willpower, 2 attack, with a useful ability. Once we get more cheaper Silvan allies, like Naith Guide, the whole thing will be even more interesting.\n\n \n\nFinally the example with Bilbo Baggins is a bit heartbreaking for my favourite Hobbit. He is just the same threat cost as Galadriel, she can do the drawing at any given moment together with threat reduction, and she has got the incredible passive ability. Bilbo's advantage is his one action but the stats make it not a very advantageous one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105678-galadriel-and-the-time-mechanic/?do=findComment&comment=1079773","commentId":1079773,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1399730148,"content":"Shadow and Flame is the quest where you are set to 0 threat right away right?

This is the internet, where we've taught ourselves to be short and sweet, so a short reply - with or without arguments - is not necessarily being rude. An antagonist is \"somebody or something opposing or in conflict with another\"; it's not simply a term associated with movies or plays. I'm saying that you are seeking confrontation where others are simply stating their opinion.\n\nI hope I don't have to jump in to break up any more fights on here for a while. It seems to be getting a little too common. Can't we all just respect one another?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105678-galadriel-and-the-time-mechanic/?do=findComment&comment=1082580","commentId":1082580,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1399952923,"content":" \n\n> Without a single arguement? My post implyed that he costs too little to be bringing people from the grave, which is an arguement to me.\n\n \n\nIt didn't actually. It lacked the direction to make it mean what you clarified it too. (Your entire post is only a statement that he wouldn't have cost 3). You felt it was clear you meant that it cost too little because the ability would be a strong one.\n\nHowever it could just have easily have been that you thought the ability was too weak for a cost of 3.\n\nThe \"implicaiton\" doesn't exist at all in your one sentence. Your clarification (that leadership allies are generally over-costed and that the ability is very rare) is much  more valuable. I think Lleimmoen would have appreciated that extra bit in your first response.\n\nWhich I think is the entire misunderstanding here. I don't mean to complain if it really is an English second language issue as Leptokurt suggests, however people are going to misinterpret your intention if it isn't as clear as you think it is.\n\n\nAs for the topic at hand -\n\nI completely agree that threat isn't and never has been a good time mechanic in the game. It functions like that for most decks but not ones that have a lot of threat reduction. (Thematically the threat mechanic really represents rising danger rather than time running out).\n\nOn the other hand I don't think that being able to reduce your threat by 1 every turn will be a problem in most quests (some as already mentioned, are ruined by it). Galadrim's Greeting already allowed you to reduce your threat by a massive 18 per game (if you draw all 3 - but your chances of doing so are greatly increased by playing a deck that can go longer because of threat reduction).\n\nIt already is the case that if you choose to play a threat reduction strategy of any kind you can completely ignore the risk of time running out. Obviously this reduces your other cards so it's not necessarily a flaw in design - however I feel a built in time mechanic for quests that want to be timed would be better.\n\nWe do have some examples though - locations that take damage and you lose if they're killed (all you need is for them to take 1 damage a turn as a forced effect on the card to get a built in maximum time limit) or the first hobbit saga quest which really feels like you're playing until dawn.\n\nThe question I would ask is, how important is a time mechanic to all quests? Does it really matter on a quest that isn't about threat to make you lose."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105678-galadriel-and-the-time-mechanic/?do=findComment&comment=1082776","commentId":1082776,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1399967872,"content":"Yeah, yeah, you and your smart long-ass posts.

If you (try to) discuss with someone age is something very important. If Trololo is as young as I think he is, it might explain his behaviour. I am a teacher myself and I deal with these kind of statements daily. Young people have yet to learn how to discuss properly. And 12 is the age when they usually start to emphazise and talk sensitive.\n\n \n\nSo either Trololo is just to young to express himself, or he is annoying people on purpose.

If threat ever got beyond 1 I'd be in trouble, and probably lose miserably, since silvan will not be able to chump block to victory on this quest.
