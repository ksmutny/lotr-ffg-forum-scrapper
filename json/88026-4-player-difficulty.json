I've played 2 and three a few times, but almost exclusively solo.  Certainly some of the early quests seemed like solo play was the one that hadn't been tested thoroughly enough (Dol Guldur & return to Mirkwood, anyone?). Interesting to hear it seems to have switched.\n\nPlaying solo, I find it very difficult to actually lose Druadan Forest.

And I agree that since FFG mentions somewhere in a small note that this game could be played by 3 and 4 they probably should test it more with all numbers of player (1-4) But they probably give more thoughts to 1-2 player since that is what the game was and is mainly developed for. Like some of their other games that is +2 players and could be played with just one but not really build for just one player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88026-4-player-difficulty/?do=findComment&comment=834103","commentId":834103,"userName":"rekath16","timestamp":1375959797,"content":"I have played 8 4-players-games and hundreds of 3-player-games with my playgroup. OCTGN makes that possible, I fear in personal games the board would be overwhelmed with cards. I really love Multiplayer-games, 3 players for me is kind of normal. Some time ago where mono-decks still had not the support which they got now with the new APs, it was possible to play Monos without problems. Now it got even better and I assure you, its a lot of fun.\n\nBut, some quests absolutely get CRAZY, talking about Druadan-Forest, Into the Pit, Massing at Osgiliath and Battle of Laketown. Osgiliath for example you have right of the bat 3+3+3=9 enemies in the stagin area. LOL!\n\nWe won all of them in a 3-player-game and it was hard enaugh, so hard, that I dont even am excited to play anytime anyone of them (except Into the Pit which we scored in a 4player-game 203 pretty awful).\n\n \n\nrekath"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88026-4-player-difficulty/?do=findComment&comment=834404","commentId":834404,"userName":"Troymk1","timestamp":1375983929,"content":"Osgiliath, in 4 player it's 12 enemies + 4 more encounter cards\n\n \n\nAnd of course all those Snagas head straight for your weakest player\n\n \n\n:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nBut yes, we've won it.  Sentinel is massive in Multiplayer.

(Of course some of your decks can specialize but Sentinel and ranged will be key then.)\n\n \n\nMain problem?  The Riddles.   You essentially need to keep adding threat and get them right.  As Bilbo only gets one useful defence a round. \n\n \n\nWeighing which cards to take as Riddles and which to take as their other effect is crucial.\n\n \n\nI played 4 games and lost by this route each time, and finally just now got through the whole quest in only 4 turns.  All players threat dials were in the 40s and we escaped with every single enemy in the deck either engaged or in the staging area. \n \n\nWhen the final round came and treacheries told me to go get a Warg and engage one with each player, then the go get a goblin per player from the discard pile and add to staging area came up twice I thought I was a going into the stew. \n\n \n\nBut Thicket of spears being available gave me the confidence to have fully quested my Rohan Deck, and a helping hand (hoof) from Asfaloth, and Eowyn's discard ability allowed the 20 progress needed to get past The Warg's Glade and the quest Stage need of 16.   Just. \n\n \n\nOtherwise it would have been.....bloody. "}]}
