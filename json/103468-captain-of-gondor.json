Should go straight into any deck that uses tactics Boromir, since he will be able to make use of both bonuses thanks to his readying action.

I think they did a great job with this card, and I am excited to see the other titles, i'm very happy to have cards that are flexible, and can be used in a number of different decks. By providing more cards that play off of the seldom used traits of the different heroes, these cool cards should be able to be used in a variety of decks of theme players and optimal deck players (not sure what to call it). Very happy with the direction their going. Definitely enough to get me excited.\n\nEdited April 8, 2014 by Tracker1"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1042551","commentId":1042551,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1396994947,"content":"I need to find a couple of slots in my attachment deck now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1042556","commentId":1042556,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1396995140,"content":"Wow, nice nice"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1042557","commentId":1042557,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1396995146,"content":"What card number does that appear to be?  To me it looks like #140.  If so we probably won't see it until the last AP."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1042613","commentId":1042613,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1396998541,"content":"That was a really great article overall.  Always cool to hear Caleb's insight and i think i speak for most of us that this game has a really exciting future in his hands.  This may seem overly cliche but he just \"gets it\".  We want theme, we want good player cards, we want trait support but we also want the spheres to retain their importance.  It seems he's accomplishing all of this splendidly"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1042622","commentId":1042622,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1396998934,"content":"I think they did a mistake in making the Steward of gondor card with such an ability.

I love this card but I'm not too fond of the art as it is way too similar to the armor used in the movies. I think FFG does it best when they present their own take on Tolkien's world and not mimicking Peter Jackson. Seriously, check out the comparison's below. FFG should be careful of Jackson's lawyers might take notice!\n\n \n\n \n\nGondorMilitary3.jpg [http://wiki.lindefirion.net/images/GondorMilitary3.jpg]\n\n \n\ngondorknight.JPG [http://www.councilofelrond.com/wp-content/uploads/modules/My_eGallery/gallery/characters/other/gondorians/gondorknight.JPG]\n\n \n\ncaptain-of-gondor.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-ringmaker/cards/captain-of-gondor.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1050644","commentId":1050644,"userName":"Karlson","timestamp":1397596043,"content":"I'm going to have to be a dissenter here.  I am really fond of the Lord of the Rings movies (they're what got me to be such a huge fan of everything Tolkien) and I actually really like the artwork on the Captain of Gondor card because the Gondorian armor in the movies is amazing.  Maybe I'm also getting a bit overly happy at the idea of putting the Captain of Gondor and Horn of Gondor attachments on Boromir and sending him out to slay Orcs in the ruins of Osgiliath..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1050686","commentId":1050686,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1397597759,"content":"> I'm going to have to be a dissenter here.  I am really fond of the Lord of the Rings movies (they're what got me to be such a huge fan of everything Tolkien) and I actually really like the artwork on the Captain of Gondor card because the Gondorian armor in the movies is amazing.  Maybe I'm also getting a bit overly happy at the idea of putting the Captain of Gondor and Horn of Gondor attachments on Boromir and sending him out to slay Orcs in the ruins of Osgiliath...\n\n \n\nI love the movies as well, but for that I have Lotr tcg. When I play Lotr lcg I want to have a totally different perspective. That's why I don't particularly like the art on Captain of Gondor, as well as in Follow Me! Wingfoot, on the other hand, is one of the best pieces of artwork to be in this game in my humble opinion. The new Creature enemies in the Nin-in-Eilph also have amazing art.\n\nEdited April 15, 2014 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1050852","commentId":1050852,"userName":"Karlson","timestamp":1397606635,"content":"Wingfoot is pretty amazing.  Almost makes you wish the cards were larger so the artwork could get the recognition it deserves.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103468-captain-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=1050946","commentId":1050946,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1397612064,"content":"I've never minded the FFG artists having a more liberally adapted style to that of Jackson's movie.
