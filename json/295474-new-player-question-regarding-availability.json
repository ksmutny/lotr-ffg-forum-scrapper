Obviusly the \"Story\" tells about Deluxe + Cycle...You can play only Deluxes, but you lose a lot of player cards and scenarios. \n\nOtherwise I recommend to buy \"Khazad-Dum\" + Cycle, \"Heirs of Numenor\" + Cycle, \"Voice of Isengard\" + Cycle....and then two Sagas.\n\nI know that there are a lot of products \"very hard to find\", but you can find all on Online Shops (Amazon etc..).\n\nI live in Milan (Italy) and I tell you that I had to wait 1 year in order to finish the collection. I think that this is easier in USA. \n\nEdited May 23, 2019 by aliprandifabio"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295474-new-player-question-regarding-availability/?do=findComment&comment=3707631","commentId":3707631,"userName":"IAmTheSmitty","timestamp":1558624769,"content":"Thank you for the reply.  Should I stock up on the Deluxe expansions, and not start them until I have the adventure packs?   Did you end up waiting until you had the entire collection of a cycle before you started the Deluxe?  I really love the lore that will go into the Khazad-Dum Deluxe Expansion, but I don't think I'll have much luck getting to the Dwarrowdelf Packs quickly.  It'll probably be that I finish the Deluxe, and then move on and wait for FFG to reprint.   \n\nSmitty"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295474-new-player-question-regarding-availability/?do=findComment&comment=3707695","commentId":3707695,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1558632342,"content":"I've always opened and played the deluxe expansions right when I got them, but I would always get all corresponding adventure packs before starting the next deluxe, if that makes sense.\n\nIf you are going to do a deluxe by itself, and play another cycle before getting the packs for the first one, Khazad-dum is probably the best choice for that.\n\nEdited May 23, 2019 by Wandalf the Gizzard\n-"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295474-new-player-question-regarding-availability/?do=findComment&comment=3707715","commentId":3707715,"userName":"IAmTheSmitty","timestamp":1558634145,"content":"Good Afternoon,\n\n     It does, and thank you for the reply.  I checked online, like aliprandifabio [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/336356-aliprandifabio/] suggested, and found all of the Dwarrowdelf Adventure Packs.  It is just that, at a glance, it would cost around $172 for the six packs.  Some of them are virtually the same cost as MSRP, but most are marked up due to supply/demand.  I guess I'll start collecting them through FFG and Amazon, and just skip between Deluxe Expansions based, primarily, on which ones I have the Adventure Packs for.  One last question: I know it may not fit the lore particularly well, but is it possible for me to play the Adventures out of Order, if I happen to struggle to find one or two in the group?  Thanks again for the assistance.\n\nSmitty"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295474-new-player-question-regarding-availability/?do=findComment&comment=3707729","commentId":3707729,"userName":"aliprandifabio","timestamp":1558635238,"content":"I think that this fantastic game has an high average value.\n\nI love this game and I am willing to pay a lot of money to buy Deluxes-APs.\n\nThe price you have written is very high, but it is clear to understand that it is a difficult game to recover and, who owns it, would sell it at crazy prices. \n\nMy 2 cent: Dwarrowdelf is a Must Have eheheh. \n\nEdited May 23, 2019 by aliprandifabio"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295474-new-player-question-regarding-availability/?do=findComment&comment=3707732","commentId":3707732,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1558635660,"content":"I would not dream of selling my collection, ha."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295474-new-player-question-regarding-availability/?do=findComment&comment=3707851","commentId":3707851,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1558649336,"content":"> 4 hours ago, IAmTheSmitty said:\n> \n> Good Afternoon,\n> \n>      It does, and thank you for the reply.  I checked online, like aliprandifabio [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/336356-aliprandifabio/] suggested, and found all of the Dwarrowdelf Adventure Packs.  It is just that, at a glance, it would cost around $172 for the six packs.  Some of them are virtually the same cost as MSRP, but most are marked up due to supply/demand.  I guess I'll start collecting them through FFG and Amazon, and just skip between Deluxe Expansions based, primarily, on which ones I have the Adventure Packs for.  One last question: I know it may not fit the lore particularly well, but is it possible for me to play the Adventures out of Order, if I happen to struggle to find one or two in the group?  Thanks again for the assistance.\n> \n> Smitty\n\nIf you don't mind to have the story spoiled (specially in later cycles, that are tied between them), you can do it...\n\nDon't remember a single scenario that couldn't be beaten without a specific Adventure Pack (at least until the Voice of Isengard cycle -
