FFG would have to rule on that.  It would make team play more interesting.  I'm also still having trouble with core pg 25.  \"When a player plays an ally card, it comes into play under his control and is placed in his play area.\"  Does this apply to sneak attack gandalf? I'm not \"playing\" gandalf, I'm putting him INTO play.  I should be allowed to put him  anywhere.  Unless they already ruled on that.\n\nBut in regards to the above, FFG will probably say something along the lines of, \"you must pay for costs of cards you control with cards under your control.\"\n\nBut then again, I'm not FFG."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85137-across-table-play/?do=findComment&comment=803891","commentId":803891,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1371299442,"content":"on page 25 the manual talks about costs.  The short of it is that you have to pay for costs with characters or resources that you control, so that cross table kind of cost-paying isn't allowed:\n\n \n\nPaying Costs\nMany cards are written in a “pay or exhaust X to do\nY” manner. When confronted with such a construct,\neverything before the word “to” is considered the cost,\nand everything after the word “to” is considered an\neffect.\nCosts can only be payed with cards or resources that a\nplayer controls.
