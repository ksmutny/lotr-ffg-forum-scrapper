It destroyed Peril in Pelargir even with no allies out and Galadriel being almost useless since you quest with attack (battle keyword). I may have gotten a bit lucky with several enemies coming as shadow cards but overall this deck seems great....almost too great.\n\nI took a break from my Hobbit journey since I had been using that same deck in those same quests for so long. I'll get back to the last two quests there soon and at least I know I can use this Boromir deck and be totally un-thematic if I lose too many times in a row.\n\nI don't really have the time to build my own decks and often rely on the great RingsDB but it can occasionally be difficult because I always seem to be missing one or two cards from a pack I don't have yet. Even in the Boromir deck I had to replace one Dwarven Tomb as I don't have two of them.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242398-seastans-boromir-deck/?do=findComment&comment=2636114","commentId":2636114,"userName":"Mazarbul","timestamp":1486839041,"content":"Yes it's too strong.

I don't play it much anymore myself, but it does hold a special place in my heart for all the time I spent tuning it.\n\nPeople like to point out which cards they consider too overpowered, between Boromir, Steward, and Blood/Fire. My own opinion is that they all are.\n\nIn a game where Boromir didn't exist, for example, you can get a similar sort of deck by stacking the attachments on a Hobbit with Fast Hitch + Unexpected Courage. Or another deck I have uses Gondorian Fire on Aragorn with Roheryn, and he just kills every enemy before they can even attack. \n\nIn a game without Steward, you can put Resourceful on Boromir and achieve the same deck, although I'd probably use Arwen to guarantee I can play Resourceful on turn 1.\n\nIn a game without Steward or Blood/Fire? Well you could build a deck that uses Keeping Count with Boromir and stomp through nightmare quests all the same.\n\nSo I don't think there's a single culprit. It just happens that by putting all these cards in one deck you get something spectacular."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242398-seastans-boromir-deck/?do=findComment&comment=2636891","commentId":2636891,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1486914518,"content":"> 32 minutes ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> In a game without Steward or Blood/Fire?

A hobbit, such as Bilbo Baggins [http://ringsdb.com/card/02001], might be a better option due to Fast Hitch [http://ringsdb.com/card/02103] and A Burning Brand [http://ringsdb.com/card/02033] access.\n> \n> Rest in peace, deck to rule them all. With Caldara [http://ringsdb.com/card/06107] errata'd as well, we look to Vilya [http://ringsdb.com/card/04137] decks to carry the torch.\n\nI personally always found Vilya decks even better because they are more resilient to everything except dealing with more than 1 enemies on turn one. This is my vilya deck for example: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4880/elrond-gandalf-arwen-undomiel-for-the-strongest-solo-dec-3.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4880/elrond-gandalf-arwen-undomiel-for-the-strongest-solo-dec-3.0]\n\nWith the errata I think that there is no use of many equipment anymore. Here is what I may test in the future about Boromir: http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/71232 [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/71232]\n\nEdited December 21, 2017 by Rouxxor"}]}
