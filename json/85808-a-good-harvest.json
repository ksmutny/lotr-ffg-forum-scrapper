However, keeping count as a 0 cost card need to have a match with an hero ressource icon, and a good harvest does not grant you the icon ressource match as it only stipulates that you could pay with other spheres ressources.\n\nFinally, what is the ruling :\n1/ you can play Beorn, but you cannot play keeping count with A Good Harvest\n2/ you can play both with a good harvest and no issue with the 0 cost rules (icon ressource match)\n3/ You cannot play either card as you need a ressource icon match even for Beorn\n\nMy feelings would go to solution 3/ as the card purpose, for me, sounds more orientated to improve 2-3 colors deck playability than providing extra color for a specific card need.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85808-a-good-harvest/?do=findComment&comment=808226","commentId":808226,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1372945668,"content":"Good Harvest has\n\n \n\nName a sphere.
