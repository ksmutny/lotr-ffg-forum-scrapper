As has been said, some of the best cards are in the core set in single copies. For a PvP game like Warhammer or A Game of Thrones, you need those extra core set cards in order to win. If you're playing LotR solo, you can skip the second core set. If you plan on competing in a house tournament or the online tournaments and are super competitive, it may be worth it for you. Many of us have trouble keeping up with the expansions and adventure packs as it stands and would rather get new stuff than the 56 or so extra cards you'll be able to use from a second core set. I still haven't bought Khazad-Dum or any of the Dwarrowdelf packs, and with the announcement of The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill, it's looking less and less likely that I'll ever purchase a second core set."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63065-how-many-core-sets-are-needed/?do=findComment&comment=617366","commentId":617366,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1334333501,"content":"I have 2 core set but i agree is not really necessary.Yes get one more U courage and additional sneak attack +Dwarfen tomb is cool but you can play without for sure."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63065-how-many-core-sets-are-needed/?do=findComment&comment=617379","commentId":617379,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1334336046,"content":"One is enough and probably more fun, if you love a challenge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63065-how-many-core-sets-are-needed/?do=findComment&comment=617461","commentId":617461,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1334366302,"content":"If only I had a Core Set for every time this question was posted... gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\nKidding badash56. Welcome to the site.\n\nThat was one of my first questions when I got into the game too.\n\nI ended up getting a second core set, and I don't regret it. But, I played with just one for a while at first.\n\nI'd say, go with one for a while. Make sure you love the game.\n\nWhen you find out that you do, if you really want the extra multiples (especially if you want to play with others and provide them with decks), then adding is worth it.\n\nEnjoy!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63065-how-many-core-sets-are-needed/?do=findComment&comment=617616","commentId":617616,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1334412269,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nyou need 1...that is all\n\n\n\nThis is very true!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63065-how-many-core-sets-are-needed/?do=findComment&comment=617812","commentId":617812,"userName":"Legolas of Darkwood","timestamp":1334474809,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nyou need 1...that is all\n\n\n\n \n\n~ signed ~\n\nHowever - as always -, the more the better (unfortunately):\n\n+) 2 Core sets open up the possibillity to use 3 copies of several good card (that come with the set only twice)\n\n+) 3 Core sets allows you to use 3 copies of whatever card you want to use (including a couple of strong cards that are in the set only once...)\n\n+) More that 3 core sets allow you to build more decks without the need to take them appart every time... 6 Core sets would be nice actually gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]\n\n \n\nI have three sets now and having less would annoy me every time we lose a game.
