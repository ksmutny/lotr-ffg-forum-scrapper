Let's say there is a Pelargir Ringleader in the staging area in the encounter phase, along with another enemy with higher engagement cost. After I make the first check (against enemy X), I engage the Ringleader, who brings in a Cunning Informant. I've already made my engagement check against the enemy sitting in the staging area, so would I make another and engage me due to the Informant's effect? I'm guessing not, but I want to be sure.\n\nFor reference:\n\nhttp://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Pelargir-Ringleader-PiPN [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Pelargir-Ringleader-PiPN]\n\n http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Cunning-Informant-PiPN [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Cunning-Informant-PiPN]\n\nThanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270547-multiple-engagement-checks/?do=findComment&comment=3229148","commentId":3229148,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1519674038,"content":"If you already made the engagement check against that enemy you don't have to do it again.
