I can therefore also assume that allies are not \"attached\" to heroes and remain in play whilst a hero perishes?\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\n \n\nVyron\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46808-glorfindels-healing-ability-etc/?do=findComment&comment=468787","commentId":468787,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1305464301,"content":"Would want to heal him before he takes the last damage and dies.\n\nAllies are characters, just like heroes.

The exception is cards that are revealed from the encounter deck. They are resolved as they are revealed. Since combat is resolved in several steps, you can see the damage you will receive before you receive it, and so can heal damage to prepare yourself (you can play actions between all steps in combat)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46808-glorfindels-healing-ability-etc/?do=findComment&comment=480656","commentId":480656,"userName":"Ileopsoas","timestamp":1307289517,"content":"Toqtamish said:\n\nRight.

If not playing him (which is a mistake), use Gandalf.\n\nAs for the question, there needs to be a damage token on a character that Glorfindel can heal, he cannot heal anything that is applied during the resolution of the attack. It is not Magic. It is Elvish. And though Elvish Magic is obviously the best, it is fair to the game and does not cheat."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46808-glorfindels-healing-ability-etc/?do=findComment&comment=480699","commentId":480699,"userName":"sWhiteboy","timestamp":1307294594,"content":"Hummerhorn says that when \"hummerhorn engages a player....\"\n\nDoes his forced ability still apply when the player engages the hummerhorn?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46808-glorfindels-healing-ability-etc/?do=findComment&comment=480720","commentId":480720,"userName":"Azlinea","timestamp":1307297651,"content":"sWhiteboy said:\n\n \n\nHummerhorn says that when \"hummerhorn engages a player....\"\n\nDoes his forced ability still apply when the player engages the hummerhorn?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYes hummerhorns still does the damage to a hero (or is it character?) of your choice. I think the official rules faq stated it but I think it would have been nice for them to say '~ engages a player or is engaged by a player' so that certain cards only have a special effect if they engage and other cards only have an effect if they are engaged by a player. Just a personal thing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46808-glorfindels-healing-ability-etc/?do=findComment&comment=480725","commentId":480725,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1307297940,"content":"From the rule book.\n\n\"Whether an enemy is engaged through an engagement check, through a card effect, or through a player’s choice, the end result is the same, with the enemy and the player engaging one another.
