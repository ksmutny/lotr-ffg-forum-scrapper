I so much wished to see more Elves (and especially Noldor) but just like Glorfindel Elrohir seems to be super weak. And I fear Elladan will not help things out that much.\n\nJust consider, for the cost of 10, you get someone to either quest for 2 (compare to Frodo, not to mention Éowyn, Bifur or Glóin with Dáin about), or he can defend even if for 3 (compare to Dáin or Denethor), PAY! for his ability just to defend again or attack for 2, again compare to either Boromir or Imrahil who ready so much more effectively."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61906-new-hero/?do=findComment&comment=606361","commentId":606361,"userName":"gokubb","timestamp":1331895446,"content":"With the new Secrecy mechanic, I wouldn't be suprised to see them make Elladan a quest character instead of a carbon copy of Elrohir. It would be great to run just these two. Have Elladan quest, and use Elrohir for defense, then attack. They would have to mix in some way to keep your threat below 20 (I doubt Elladan will be Spirit).\n\nBut, if they do make him the attack version of his brother, it would make for a pretty decent Noldor only deck with Glorfindel mixed in. High starting threat, but one good quest, defense, and attack character for a tri-sphere deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61906-new-hero/?do=findComment&comment=606396","commentId":606396,"userName":"Bomb","timestamp":1331900913,"content":"I think making him a quest character would be a pretty weak effort.  To have a Hero get boosted by an objective would make part of his strength only effective in 1 or 2 quests.  I wouldn't be surprised if he simply became an Ally that you play from your hand however."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61906-new-hero/?do=findComment&comment=606413","commentId":606413,"userName":"gokubb","timestamp":1331906583,"content":"I didn't mean an objective character, I meant a character good at questing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61906-new-hero/?do=findComment&comment=606416","commentId":606416,"userName":"Bomb","timestamp":1331907587,"content":"gokubb said:\n\nI didn't mean an objective character, I meant a character good at questing.\n\n\n\nSorry about that!  I feel really dumb about misreading your post!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61906-new-hero/?do=findComment&comment=606429","commentId":606429,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1331910618,"content":"gokubb said:\n\nBut, if they do make him the attack version of his brother, it would make for a pretty decent Noldor only deck with Glorfindel mixed in.

I felt like I couldn't even justify having him in a deck because A. Elladan isn't out yet, and B. Without Elladan, his ability becomes useless. A character who can defend multiple times with 1 defense is a dead character.
