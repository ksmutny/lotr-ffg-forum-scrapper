As you alluded, however, the earlier quests would be even easier if you added Treasure cards and I just can't see FFG producing a supplemental pack for a previous AP. It'd almost be like saying they designed it wrong in the first place. \n\nNow as for expansions that bring new Treasure cards, Encounter cards, and Saga-like rules to old cycles, I think it sounds interesting. Do I think it will happen? No. But then, I never thought we'd be able to play events directly from the books either . . ."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63209-retrofitting-som-and-kd/?do=findComment&comment=619431","commentId":619431,"userName":"Cotillion37","timestamp":1334775530,"content":"Even if they don't retrofit the treasure cards for use in the previous cycles, you could always just house rule it. Like, you kill a hill troll, you get a treasure card."}]}
