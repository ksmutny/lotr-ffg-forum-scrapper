As horrible as they could be, hanging around on stage 2 to build up enough power to smash through to the end quickly was a potentially viable strategy in Nin-in-Eilph, partly because you didn't have to deal with the boss until stage 3.\n\nAlso the Deadly Marsh Adder kind of messes up my past feeling of \"Defence isn't so important for NiE\" by both having 4 attack and discarding damaged characters when it engages."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205643-nightmare-spoilers-incoming/?do=findComment&comment=2106926","commentId":2106926,"userName":"Estel Edain","timestamp":1458187106,"content":"PsychoRocka, I'd love to see the nightmare Road Darkens cards whenever you get a chance to upload them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205643-nightmare-spoilers-incoming/?do=findComment&comment=2106947","commentId":2106947,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1458187706,"content":"Ill get them up tonight for sure!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205643-nightmare-spoilers-incoming/?do=findComment&comment=2107353","commentId":2107353,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1458209922,"content":"Alright so here is the first two quests from The Road Darkens, I'll get the third up shortly!\n\n \n\nRing Goes South:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/aX02h [http://imgur.com/a/aX02h]\n\n \n\nand...\n\nJourney in the Dark:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/ONFEO [http://imgur.com/a/ONFEO]\n\nSome of the images are displaying very weirdly on imgur but anything that isn't the right way up, just zoom in and then out again and it'll correct itself!
