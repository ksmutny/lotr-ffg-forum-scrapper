However, if you are ok with playing on \"easy\" mode then there should be no problem."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188246-saga-vs-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=1793997","commentId":1793997,"userName":"jmhot","timestamp":1442240597,"content":"Thanks for the reply - I'll try easy mode first and see how it goes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188246-saga-vs-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=1794009","commentId":1794009,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1442240828,"content":"Just two Bilbos talking to each other :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188246-saga-vs-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=1794066","commentId":1794066,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1442242375,"content":"I argued in a similar thread recently that the Black Riders box can be very difficult even when you own everything released, so Easy Mode is probably your best option.
