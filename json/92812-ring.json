Because there is supposed to be so many bad things that happen if you exhaust the one ring I thought but none ever really happen.  And there is an encounter card that I frequently reveal during the staging step and says that so and so bad things happen if the one ring is exhausted and I don't see why it would be exhausted already from stages 1 and 2?  The ring is so weak I pretty much never need to use it and if I do nothing bad ever happens. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92812-ring/?do=findComment&comment=899077","commentId":899077,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1383089697,"content":"yes, i was talking with a friend about this today. the ring does indeed ready just like any other attatchment. my thinking is the following situation should never be able to happen:\n\n \n\ndraw black rider\n\nexhaust ring\n\nrider goes back\n\nhobbit= safe\n\n \n\nthematically this should really be the opposite. using the one ring on nazgul will of course have the opposite effect which is where the treachery card comes in, but to me it just insnt that bad, or that common\n\nEdited October 29, 2013 by richsabre"}]}
