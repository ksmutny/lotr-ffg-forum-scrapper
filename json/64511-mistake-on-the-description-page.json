Wonder what that allowed him to do, then. Interesting that the attributes were different too, with willpower at the bottom. One also wonders if Thorin will be much different from this version? At the very least, his threat is low compared to his stats. As for Gandalf, they probably realized that the discard an enemy ability would really detract from the spirit of the game. You could get rid of a Troll, The Watcher or even a Nazgul without having to find ways to really defeat them or keep them at bay. It would have necessitated that they be given the \"immune from player card effects\" ability to stick around. Gandalf's expensiveness and the inability to use his effect when played with Sneak Attack would have somewhat curbed that, but obviously players would still have saved up for that one big shot."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64511-mistake-on-the-description-page/?do=findComment&comment=631057","commentId":631057,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1337006708,"content":"just figured thorin out ……..\n\n\"spend wound tokens as if they were [resource] tokens\" powerful stuff"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64511-mistake-on-the-description-page/?do=findComment&comment=631070","commentId":631070,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1337008946,"content":"richsabre said:\n\njust figured thorin out ……..\n\n\"spend wound tokens as if they were [resource] tokens\" powerful stuff\n\n\n\nThat does seem really powerful. It's just like Gloin, only spending the resources heals Thorin at the same time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64511-mistake-on-the-description-page/?do=findComment&comment=631101","commentId":631101,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1337012192,"content":" Yeah, if they really made a Thorin that good, I would play him in every deck! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64511-mistake-on-the-description-page/?do=findComment&comment=631131","commentId":631131,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1337017804,"content":"Yeah, I read the same into his ability.
