But when I was rereading the insert, there was no such thing. So I take it you can just give all, say 20, damage to an ally with a single hit point? It would have made things much, much easier.\n\n \n\nAs a side question, has it been made official if the Prowl mechanic takes place before or after \"when revealed\"?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94067-upps-i-may-have-been-doing-something-really-wrong/?do=findComment&comment=916089","commentId":916089,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1385379317,"content":"i also thought this- you keep assigning damage much like the cave trolls ability, and it overspills.\n\ni will surprised if it is different as it will make it much easier\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94067-upps-i-may-have-been-doing-something-really-wrong/?do=findComment&comment=916090","commentId":916090,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1385379386,"content":"Since damahe assign one by one you cannot assign all 20 damage to one ally.

It must be divided among characters you control until either there is no damage left to assign or no characters left to assign it to.\n\nThe damage is applied simultaneously, so you can assign damage to more than 1 Silvan Refugee because their Forced effect will not trigger until after all the damage has been assigned.\n\nCheers,\n\nCaleb\n\nFor consistency with surge, doomed and other keywords, I've been triggering prowl and underworld after the when revealed has resolved.
