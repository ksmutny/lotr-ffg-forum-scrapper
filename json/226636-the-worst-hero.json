Was the potential realized largely due to Gondorian Shield, and in some decks Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire? I totally see the fascination with the latter two, it is obviously one way to rule them all, but I think Boromir is still amazing without them, and there are just so many things he can do, including paying exhaustion cost.\n\nEdited August 5, 2016 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2344285","commentId":2344285,"userName":"Kolley Kibber","timestamp":1470393065,"content":"Hello all – first post here.  As penance for my entry into the forums being on such a curmudgeonly thread, I hereby promise to build a deck around whoever “wins”.\n\n \n\nHere are my votes:\n\n \n\nA. Legolas.  Close – love them both, but both have their drawbacks for me.  Galadriel is in so many of my decks, but if I had to criticise, lately I find her toys (Mirror, Silver Harp, optionally Nenya) a bit of a burden, both in terms of including them in the first place, then in terms of drawing and playing them.  This is true of many heroes, admittedly, including many of those that I’ve given the nod to below, but especially so of Galadriel – I think the thing is that Galadriel tends to be included as a support hero, whose attachments help you to fetch the things that you need to make your deck work, but said attachments then clutter up the deck further, which can be frustrating. \n\n \n\nAs for Legolas, I still use him, but a few things count against him: the ally version tends to muscle him out lately, his ability is for the most part less vital than it used to be, and I think Haldir is actually a better target (albeit out of sphere) for most of Legolas’s usual toys (Rivendell Blade/Bow and Bow of the Galadhrim).  So I think Legolas loses out this time (although he is actually in one of my current decks, and performing admirably).\n\n \n\nB. Frodo.  It actually strikes me that they’re oddly similar as “defensive” heroes: both can avoid damage, but Frodo does it at the expense of threat, and Haldir at the expense of loading him up with enough attacking prowess to kill enemies before they even strike.  Anyway, nothing against Frodo, but Haldir’s sniping is arguably more powerful in a given situation, and (more importantly) just too much fun for him to lose out.\n\n \n\nC. Lore Aragorn.  Actually never really appreciated his ability too much, although admittedly I’ve never built around it to any great extent.  Anyway, I prefer Merry’s repeatable reduction, and he makes a certain type of deck (eg. Palantir) sing like a bird.\n\n \n\nD. Beregond.  Tough choice, as they often compete over the same role in my decks, and are even good targets for the same attachments, but the inbuilt action advantage gives Boromir the nod. \n\n \n\nE. Elrond.  I’m a fan of Elrond, but Tactics Aragorn is possibly the most pure fun out of all the heroes.\n\n \n\nF. Spirit Theoden.  Love Rohan (especially spirit Rohan), and Theoden makes a great keystone for the archetype.  Gandalf, though … some would argue that he needs his toys (actually just the staff and some readying, in my opinion) to really shine, but that’s true of many heroes, and every deck I’ve built with him has been so much fun.  \n\n \n\nG. Sam Gamgee.  I like Sam, but I have to say I’ve never really gotten him to work with any real efficacy (might be worth another go, though - maybe I'll change my mind).  Eowyn sees less play than she used to, but still has her place, and Eowyn plus Snowmane/Heregrim is still crazy fun, even if the upcoming Tactics version makes that strategy slightly redundant.\n\n \n\nH. Eomer.  This is a tight one.  Eomer is more fun, but if you don’t build around him then he doesn’t work very well in my opinion.  Arwen is almost the opposite – all she needs is Elven-Light to get a subtle draw/resource engine going that can really smooth the workings of a stalling deck.  She does lose marks for precluding ally Arwen, however."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2344861","commentId":2344861,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1470412697,"content":"A: Legolas\nB: Haldir of Lórien\nC: Spirit Merry\nD: Beregond\nE: Tactics Aragorn\nF: Spirit Théoden\nG: Éowyn\nH: Arwen Undómiel "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2347803","commentId":2347803,"userName":"Finduin","timestamp":1470454562,"content":"A:Legolas\nB:Frodo Baggins\nC:Spirit Merry\nD:Tactics Boromir\nE:Tactics Aragorn\nF:Spirit Théoden\nG:Éowyn\nH:Éomer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2349207","commentId":2349207,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1470514412,"content":"> Exactly the same as Thanatopsis's Hero Championship except you choose the hero you dislike the most(following any criteria).

Legolas.  Merry is lower threat, rocks in a hobbit deck, and has a neater ability.  Plus Legolas blocks his awesome ally.\n\nB) Thalin.  Leadership Boromir is a necessary component of Gondor decks, so I can't vote him out.\n\nC) LoFaramir.  He blocks his awesome ally, and his ability is anti-synergestic.\n\nD) SpPippin.  He's got the threat for a hobbit secrecy deck, but his ability raises threat and works against Sam/TaMerry\n\nE) Frodo.  Doesn't work well with other hobbits, and while he's an indestructable defender there are plenty of good defenders who won't raise threat.  Plus Ori is great in a dwarf deck.\n\nF) Dunhere.  Halbarad works great in a Dunedain deck\n\nG) Oin.  Gloin is a hero you build a deck around, Oin is one of the lesser dwarf deck heroes.\n\nH)  Elladan.  He's limited to work only with his brother, and Caldara has her own deck type.\n\nI)  TaBeregond.  OK, he's better than Balin, but Balin is very splashable and doesn't block a better version of his hero.  SpBeregond is better than TaBeregond\n\nJ)  Lanwyn.  SpGlorfindel is just too good.\n\nK)  Dwalin.  His ability is worthless in a good proportion of quests, while Elanor's isn't.\n\nL)  Hama.  Very powerful, but I love Gimli.\n\nM)  Elrohir.  Limited to work with his brother.\n\nN)  Thorin Oakenshield.  Tough call because Thorin is awesome in a dwarf deck, but TaTheoden first made the solo tactics deck possible.  SpTheoden is better than TaTheoden, but solo tactics and Rohan don't really overlap.\n\nO)  Brand.  This is tough for me because Brand's readying works so beautifully in two-handed with a hero that can use a post-attack action (e.g. ring holders and Beravor), but Grima is very powerful solo and has a unique effect.\n\nP)  Bard.  This is mostly because I've been playing a whole lots of quests with Dori fellowships, since Bard can attack for effectively 5 (!) against many enemies, but Dori's ability to turn practically anyone into Beregond is more useful than you might think.  He's not actually a bad hero, and I think he'd be considered a good hero in a world without Beregond.\n\nQ)  LoDenethor.  He's an awesome solo hero, but SpTheoden is the essential hero for Rohan decks.\n\nR)  Mirlonde.  A 1-3 threat discount can't stand up to card-drawing ability.\n\nS)  Theodred.  Theodred's a great leadership splash, and I think his extra resource is more generally useful than Cirdan's power.  But Theoden is also questing for 1 each turn, while Cirdan can quest for 4 or make a huge combat impact with his ring.\n\nT)  Bombur.  Dain makes dwarf decks overpowering, and Armored Destrier makes him useful for defense as well.  Bombur helps you get to 5 dwarves quickly, but his greatness ends there.\n\nU)  SpEowyn.  Eowyn's more efficient than Elfhelm, but Elfhelm is more fun, and I like TaEowyn better than SpEowyn as a splash hero.\n\nV) Bifur.  LeAragorn and his wonderful toys are just too good.\n\nW)  Ori.  Tough call, Ori is great in a dwarf deck, but Mablung is about all there is for Tactics resource acceleration, and tactics can use a lot of resources.\n\nX)  Idraen.  I don't vote against heroes that define decks, and Hirluin is Mr. Outlands.\n\nY)  Eomer.  I've been playing Amarthiul with Elfhelm, and Amarthiul at 4/4 with an Armored Destrier is a thing of beauty.\n\nZ)  Erkenbrand.  Rossiel has her own deck type, and it's not like anything else.\n\nAA)  Galdor.  LeDenethor has extra resources, resource smoothing, and good defensive potential.  Galdor's ability is most useful in a Noldor deck, but Noldor has a lot of good options without him.\n\nAB)  Beorn.  Hate to vote for him because he's so powerful and so unlike anything else, but Celeborn is required for Silvan decks.\n\nAC)  Treebeard.  Hate to vote for him because he's so powerful and so unlike anything else, but LoPippin is an indispensible part of Hobbit secrecy decks, and Treebeard blocks his totally awesome ally.\n\nAD)  Fatty Bolger.  Biggest mismatch here.  Damrod's the essential hero for trap decks, while Fatty's ability works against the hobbit secrecy type and is only useful in splash if you quest unsuccesfully.  Maybe when Valour decks become a thing Fatty will be better...\n\nAE) Imrahil.  While it's usually better to ready Imrahil than for Faramir to ready an ally, Faramir's ability is a lot easier to trigger.  Works beautifully with Lore ents."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2353131","commentId":2353131,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1470676983,"content":"Dwalin,

1\n\nA:Legolas: His ally version is such a staple in my Tactics decks that I hardly use the hero anymore.  Tactics Merry is awesome, and just became better with the possibility of solo-mono Tactics.\nB:Thalin: Artwork does it here.  While Leadermir is the inferior Boromir, he's still pretty good (using him in my Flame of the West campaign at the moment).  Thalin is experiencing a revival (I think) with all the new direct damage cards, but I'll give the nod to better character and art.\nC:Lore Faramir:  Lore Glorfindel was useful in the Core Set days and is still underrated as a hero, in my opinion.  Poor Lore Faramir, despite looking good, has never found his niche.\nD:Spirit Pippin:  Nori is really good in a dwarf deck.  Spirit Pippin ought to win (lose?) this competition.\nE:Frodo: I don't play dwarves anymore, so I had to look up what Ori did.  How could I forget the lynchpin to the old dwarven archetype?\nF:Dúnhere: Tough call.  Neither are great, but neither are bad either.  But if I have to pick one, I'll vote down Dunhere, whose staging area attack is now overshadowed by Haldir.\nG:Oin: Showers of resources wins out over dual sphere.\nH:Elladan: Caldara just keeps getting better.  Elladan only makes it into decks because his brother is so good.\nI:Balin: I like Balin's shadow cancellation, but Beregond is still a beast.\nJ:Lanwyn: Spirit Glorifndel is still really good.\nK:Dwalin: Eleanor has a handful of quests in which she is totally clutch.  Dwalin has a handful of quests in which he is sort of useful.\nL:Gimli:  There are many different decks that can be built around Hama's ability, my most recent being a Skyward Volley deck that sniped enemies over and over.  I built a Gimli Firefoot deck a while ago that was pretty fun and haven't touched him since.  Here's hoping we get a new Gimli in Sands of Harad. \nM:Elrohir: tough call, because Elrohir is excellent, but he doesn't match the sheer fun of pulling enemies over with Aragorn.\nN:Thorin Oakenshield: Tactics Theoden is quite good now!  He can do lots of things, whether its defending with Golden Shield, attacking with Herugrim, or a bit of both, and with Snowmane he can quest too.  Plus he boosts his niece to 5 willpower (go figure, the Tactics combo of Eowyn-Theoden quests for more than their Spirit counterparts).  Thorin is good, but I haven't played dwarves in ages.\nO:Brand Son of Bain:  I like Brand, but he's smelling a fart in the wind.\nP:Dori: Bard looks awesome and is very good in multiplayer.  Dori looks awesome and isn't any good at all.\nQ:Lore Denethor: Santa marshals his troops pretty well.\nR:Mirlonde: Berevor has made it back into so many of my decks: Dundain and Ents being two where she's played a key role.  Mirlonde is good, but Lore Pippin usually takes the spot she would hold.\nS:Theodred: I'm an unabashed fan of the Noldor.\nT:Bombur: I guess if you have to pick between two dwarves\nU:Elfhelm: New Eowyn greatly outshines the old, and Elfhelm is pretty fun to build around.  He not only makes mounts more useful, but songs as well.\nV:Bifur: tough call, both are good, but I'll give the nod to good old Coragorn\nW:Ori:Wait, Ori was on the ballot already, right?  Mablung is good in almost every Tactics deck.\nX:Hirluin the Fair: Friends don't let friends play Outlands.\nY:Amarthíul: Tough call, because both are good.  I'll give the nod to Eomer.\nZ:Erkenbrand: He's a good defender, but we have loads of those.  Rossiel has a wholly unique place in this game.\nAA:Galdor of the Havens: This is the version of Denethor we've always wanted.  Galdor is good, but overshadowed by his ally version and his other Noldor heroes.\nAB:Beorn: The bear is good, but I'll take the leader of the Silvan.\nAC:Treebeard: Tough call.  I like Treebeard ally better, and Pippin fits into so many decks.\nAD:Fatty Bolger: No contest.  Damrod is actually good, and Fatty is not.\nAE:Leadership Faramir: For old timesakes, I'll give the nod to the Prince, who has been putting in work since the first cycle.  I think he's about to be overshadowed by his new version though.  Leader Faramir is good, but he mostly fits into Ent decks, which is kind of thematically weird."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2355659","commentId":2355659,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1470767596,"content":"A:

Spirit Pippin.  This one is a ridiculously easy call.  Pippin's ability is useful only in a hobbit-only deck, but raising threat and un-engaging has anti-synergy with the other hobbits.  Every other spirit hero in the game is better than Pippin.\n\n \n\nDori's only problem is that Beregond exists.  Beregond has 4 defense, the same threat, also has sentinel, and goes to 6 defense with a free attachment.  Dori just can't compete with him.  But if Beregond *didn't* exist, Dori would not only be not considered a useless hero, I suspect he'd be a popular hero -- you can get to 4+ defense on turn 1 without any attachments, and solid defense is harder to get quickly than solid questing or attack, and preserves board state better.  Dori's 2 defense and 5 hit points for sentinel isn't bad, besides Beregond we have 3/4 for Erkenbrand, 1/10 for Beorn, 2/5 for two of the Aragorns, and 2/4 for both Theodens.  All those other guys have recognized-as-useful powers, but Dori's ability to take a hit is comparable to the other sentinel defenders, of which there are not a lot.  And Dori has one thing all other sentinel defenders lack -- once he's too banged up to defend by himself, *he can still help defend*.  This is important, because while you mostly quest together and attack together, you defend alone.\n\n \n\nI'm not just theory casting.  I've played a ton of quests now with a variety of two-handed fellowships featuring Dori, and Dori has never failed to be useful.  Yes, his ability requires two hero actions, but when you don't have hero actions to spare (early game), he can defend and survive for either hand.  And when you have hero actions to spare, he can make almost anyone into a solid defender.  Eleanor has to stay ready for her ability, but she's a 2/3 defender until she gets a Gondorian Shield.  Dori turns her into Beregond.  Arwen gets Light of Valinor, Dori turns her into Beregond.  And when the big bosses roll around, two hero actions can be a small price to pay for rock-solid defense.  Try him out -- replacing Dori with Beregond may always make a deck better, but sometimes you don't want to play Beregond, and for the multiplayer set, sometimes someone else is playing Beregond.  Against some bosses, even Beregond can sometimes use a helping hand.\n\n \n\nSo he's strictly inferior to Beregond, and his ability isn't nearly as awesome as it could be (if it buffed allies, everybody would love Dori).  But he's not up against Beregond, he's up against *Spirit Pippin*.\n\n \n\nB) Fatty Bolger.  Like Dori, Bombur can take a hit.  Unlike Dori, once he gets too banged up to defend his usefulness as a hero is at an end.  However, Bombur's innate ability to be two dwarves can be a real benefit to Thorin and/or Ori, and accelerate the dwarf swarm quicker.  Meanwhile, Fatty has an ability that is rarely useful, and with a 1/1/2/3 stat line his action isn't really useful for anything.  (Well, unless Dori is helping him defend.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2377860","commentId":2377860,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1471827597,"content":"Sp

So based on stats, Pippin has less thread and 2 willpower that might be usefull, Fatty is statswise useless because his only stat above 1 is defense and without Dori, Fatty can't defend. But Pippins ability is simply not useful because you wouldn't want him in an all hobbit deck while Fattys ability might be used if you get Spirit Merry along with him. So all in all really tough and it's a gut decision that gets Pippin the vote. I was just disappointed when he came out and even more so when 2 months later the black rider box appeared and we got a very useful version of Pippin in Lore. But don't be too proud Fatty you're useless too! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nB:Dori-Bombur\n\nThis one is tough too. I used Bombur in some dwarf decks and back in the days when he came out he was quite good in defending especially if you gave him a Dunedain Warning (if you play dwarfs you play Dain and thus leadership) and a Burning Brand (is in sphere for Bombur). Until you got this he really shined (and still does!) in decks where you relayed on the 5 dwarf mechanics because you could play him along 2 other dwarf heroes, put out an Erebor Record Keeper on turn 1 and boom you got your 5 dwarfs together. With Dain and Thorin or Ori he can give you quite a potent solo dwarf deck. On the other hand there is Dori. He came out very recently and was SUCH a disappointment. I mean really... +2 Defense for a lost hero action is not that good. I get his purpose, dwarfs don't have naturally high defense (compared to their willpower/attack strength when you get a bunch of them out and Dain is ready) but because he came out just last year (in 2015!!! he is barely one year old) where you could just throw in Beregond or Erkenbrand or Denethor (not thematic I know) he is just not good in my eyes. Don't get me wrong I can see potential in him but if it comes down for deck building I would use Bombur in dwarf decks because he has a great ability and can be build into a decent defender but wouldn't use Dori in dwarf (maybe if I build 3 dwarf decks that want to work together) or other decks. So sadly Dori gets the vote here. If he would have been in one of the Hobbit Boxes or in the Dwarrowdelf cycle he might have been a great addition to dwarf decks back in the days but nowadays he gets outclassed by other heroes in the defense department.     \n\nEdited August 25, 2016 by Crabble"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226636-the-worst-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2384000","commentId":2384000,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1472125889,"content":"ROUND 6\n\nA:Pippin: to many enemys have bad side effects when engaging or when still in play.

Yes you have to exhaust her but what will you do with Bilbos action? His stats are really bad, so maybe 1 willpower to the quest? That's not a kind of hero action you want in your deck. Even in soloplay I would not want him in my hero lineup because you would need a lot of help out of the extra cards you get from him to compensate for his lack of stats.
