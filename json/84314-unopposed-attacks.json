The rules do not state a distinction between ready or exhausted Heroes taking the damage, so I suppose I am not under obligation to wound one of my still ready, undefending, Heroes (if any), preferring to hurt an exhausted yet sturdier Hero, so I can counterattack with the unopposing Hero/es. Or is a ready undefending Hero the only eligible for damage? I don't think so. Am I on the right track?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84314-unopposed-attacks/?do=findComment&comment=798827","commentId":798827,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1369456833,"content":"you are correct- you can damage an exhausted hero\n\nrich"}]}
