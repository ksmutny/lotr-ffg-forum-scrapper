The rulebook says 'If Bilbo Baggins leaves play, for any reason, the players immediately lose the game.'\n\nSo, does he leaves play or is he transferred to the next player ? Because the rule for elimination states that 'All of the cards he controls, and his deck are placed in their owners’ discard piles.' Is the eliminated player the owner of Bilbo ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/245659-bilbo-and-threat-elimination-on-the-hobbit/?do=findComment&comment=2701908","commentId":2701908,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1490396719,"content":"Doesn't control of Bilbo pass the the next player, preventing the party's immediate loss?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/245659-bilbo-and-threat-elimination-on-the-hobbit/?do=findComment&comment=2701971","commentId":2701971,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1490401347,"content":"I would lean towards player elimination causing Bilbo to leave play and thus a group loss.\n\nWithout someone finding any contrary text/advice I don't see how he isn't discarded when the player is eliminated.
