You can only commit characters once to the quest. Favor of the lady does give you +1 willpower, but you commit Theodred only once: so he has 2 willpower to commit. His response can thus also be only triggered once, giving you 1 resource token on another hero committed to the quest.\n\nAfter you commited everyone to the quest, there is an action window in which you can use Unexpected Courage to ready Theodred, so he can participate in the upcoming combat phase.

Add 1 hero to that hero's resource pool.\n\n \n\nAs I see it, Theodred is a hero, and if he is committed to the quest, then he could give himself that additional resource token. Nothing in the power says he has to choose \"another\" or a \"different\" hero committed to the quest… though of course he can do so if he so chooses."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122887-favor-of-the-ladyunexpected-courage-combo-question/?do=findComment&comment=1277185","commentId":1277185,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1411670159,"content":"Yes, the resource on Theodred response can be given either to him or to another hero that has commited to the quest..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122887-favor-of-the-ladyunexpected-courage-combo-question/?do=findComment&comment=1277299","commentId":1277299,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1411675327,"content":"Yes, of course he can give the resource to himself.\n\nBut a[b\\] is a strong word so he can give the resource to any hero committed to the quest, even to a hero you do not control.

So as first player you are forced to pass it to one of your own committed heroes, as second player you can pass it to the first players committed heroes or those of yourself. But for instance, as first player, you cannot pass the resource to the second/third player. This is all because the first player has to commit his characters, before the second player, before the third,.....\n\nThought it worth mentioning since I see this going wrong sometimes when new players start to play multiplayer.\n\nEdited September 26, 2014 by Jban"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122887-favor-of-the-ladyunexpected-courage-combo-question/?do=findComment&comment=1277753","commentId":1277753,"userName":"ziggy2000","timestamp":1411702096,"content":">  But for instance, as third player, you cannot pass the resource to the first/second player.\n\nWhy not?
