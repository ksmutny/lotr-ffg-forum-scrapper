I've revealed a Ship location, but I assume I can play Strider's Path on it to make it the active location because I don't believe it's part of the staging area yet.\n\n \n\nI don't think that's correct. Contrast Strider's Path with Thalin. Strider's Path says \"Response: After a location is revealed ...\" but Thalin says \"... as it is revealed by the encounter deck.\" FAQ entry 1.37 says to resolve \"passive abilities first, Forced effects second, Response actions third. When determining the order of effect resolution among abilities within those categories, players should first resolve abilities that use the word “when” and then resolve abilities with the word “after”.\" And the rulebook, on page 14, says that \"encounter cards are revealed one at a time, with any “when revealed” effects being resolved before the next card is revealed. Enemy and location cards revealed in this manner are placed in the staging area, treachery cards are resolved and (unless otherwise indicated by the card text) placed in the discard pile.\"\n\n \n\nLet's put all those things together. You must resolve \"When\" effects before you resolve \"After\" effects. Therefore, by the time you can resolve \"After a location is revealed\", you must have resolved the \"When Revealed\" effect first. And since all revealed cards are placed in the staging area before the next card is revealed, I think it's fair to say that \"add to the staging area\" is considered part of the \"reveal\" effect. (The FAQ clarifies that \"reveal\" always means \"reveal and add to the staging area\"). I don't think the two are separable, which means that by the time you can play any \"After X is revealed\" effects, card X is already in the staging area. Thalin gets to interrupt the card (and, for example, kill 1-HP enemies that surge before their Surge keyword can trigger) because he's an \"as\" effect. But Strider's Path is an \"After\" effect, so the whole reveal-and-add process has to happen first.\n\n \n\nTherefore, by the time you can play Strider's Path on a Ship location, it's already in the staging area and under the effect of the quest card, making it immune to Strider's Path.\n\nEdited October 15, 2016 by rmunn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232426-revealing-and-adding-to-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=2458424","commentId":2458424,"userName":"JYoder","timestamp":1476543412,"content":"Section 1.37 deals with \"resolving multiple effects with a shared condition,\" which is not really the case here.

So if Strider's Path said \"When a location is revealed\", then I'd be 100% in agreement with you. But it says \"After\". And so the question is: is adding to the staging area considered part of the revealing process? Or is it more like there was a card effect that says \"After a card is revealed, add it to the staging area\"?\n\n \n\nIf it's the latter, then you have two effects that should trigger at once, so the player gets to pick the most advantageous order. But if it's the former, then the card has landed in the staging area before you can trigger \"After a card is revealed\" effects.\n\n \n\nSince the core rulebook says that cards are revealed one at a time, with \"When Revealed\" effects resolving before the next card comes out, and \"cards revealed in this manner are placed in the staging area\", I believe that means that the \"add to the staging area\" is part of the reveal process, rather than something that happens as a separate step. But I'll grant that it's something that is not quite clear, hence your confusion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232426-revealing-and-adding-to-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=2458544","commentId":2458544,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1476550744,"content":"Merry.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Wastes-of-Eriador/Merry.jpg]Anborn.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Land-of-Shadow/Anborn.jpg]\n\n \n\nWhy the distinction here?

Shuffle the encounter deck.'\n\n- Thus I can trigger Merry no matter when the actual adding of the enemy to the staging area occurs with respect to an \"after revealed\" trigger.\n\n \n\nThis is a bit tortured, but given such an interpretation, I am unsure if the last sentence of what you said actually clarifies the situation."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232426-revealing-and-adding-to-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=2458583","commentId":2458583,"userName":"JYoder","timestamp":1476553916,"content":"Kakita and rmunn -- I see what you mean now: That Strider's Path says \"After revealed\" rather than \"When revealed\" which is a good distinction, and you believe adding it to the staging area is part of the reveal.\n\n \n\nHowever, I don't think adding to the staging area is part of \"When revealed,\" but is the next step. Hence, an \"After revealed\" response like Strider's Path (which is before a location can even enter the staging area) seems legit to me. Seastan -- if I'm understanding you, that's what you're saying too? (Though regarding Merry, it does say revealed from the top of the encounter deck, which is not happening with Predatory Wolves.)\n\n \n\nHere's a \"for instance\" -- say you reveal a location that has an effect that occurs when it gets added to the staging area (not sure there is one) and say the active location also has an effect that triggers when added to the staging area. In my mind, if I play Strider's Path, it doesn't make sense to trigger the new location's effect (saying it made it to the staging area), and then do the same with the active location.

Cancellation effects get priority before any other triggered effect.\n\n \n\nI understand that. Hence why I assume it should cancel even cards that say Immune, as they aren't in play yet.\n\n \n\nI guess I view cards like Strider's Path as a type of cancellation effect... but I suppose I shouldn't as it doesn't actually use the word \"cancel\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232426-revealing-and-adding-to-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=2462382","commentId":2462382,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1476769788,"content":"Revealed cards are in play and text is active.  So, if immune, they are immune to cancellation effects.\n\n \n\nFor comparison: Thalin's damaged is cancelled by Toughness.  As the card is being revealed, it has come into play and the Toughness keyword is active (this has been officially ruled on)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232426-revealing-and-adding-to-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=2462468","commentId":2462468,"userName":"shosuko","timestamp":1476774017,"content":"Strider's Path should not allow you to travel to a location that is immune to player card effects.  When a card is revealed it immediately enters play without any break between them.\n\n \n\n(1.37) Timing of effect resolution When resolving multiple effects with a shared condition, players should use this order of resolution: passive abilities first, Forced effects second, Response actions third. When determining the order of effect resolution among abilities within those categories, players should first resolve abilities that use the word “when” and then resolve abilities with the word “after”. A player card effect that cancels an encounter card effect interrupts this timing structure. A cancel effect must be triggered immediately after the encounter card effect that it cancels.\n\n \n\nThis is the reason The Door is Closed! works, and Strider's Path doesn't.  It's not because of the wording for what it responds to, but because TDiC is a canceling type event.\n\nEdited October 18, 2016 by shosuko"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232426-revealing-and-adding-to-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=2462478","commentId":2462478,"userName":"shosuko","timestamp":1476774592,"content":"> Merry.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Wastes-of-Eriador/Merry.jpg]Anborn.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Land-of-Shadow/Anborn.jpg]\n> \n>  \n> \n> Why the distinction here?

You must trigger it after the enemy was revealed, but before it was added to the staging area, because if you resolve the text that says \"add it to the staging area\", you've done something else and are unable to trigger Merry.\n\n \n\nIsn't the difference between these that Merry would ONLY trigger when a card is revealed where Anborn encompasses cards being revealed as well as cards entering the staging area from other sources?\n\nIsn't that part of the trick to trapping trolls?\n\nI'm pretty sure there is no timing distinction between these two effects when it comes to questing."}]}
