I'll admit it's mostly nostalgia, but there's something about them that I really love. Maybe it's the now retro style art which I find incredible or the fact that they made so many obscure Tolkien references and tried to have a scope of Middle Earth as wide as possible. I hope this game achieves that some day, so that we can explore as many areas of Middle Earth as we can (they seem to be aiming towards that). One thing that I find the most interesting about that game is the travel mechanics, where you can just go to any place you want if they're available.\n\nEdited September 24, 2013 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90858-new-master-of-lore-article-old-forest-road/?do=findComment&comment=873857","commentId":873857,"userName":"Kerstoid","timestamp":1379998983,"content":">  \n> \n> As a Tolkien card gamer, you should at least check it out.

The best card game about Tokien. Even now is 20 years old but still lot of people play it. Actually FFG take a lot of idea from this game to they LOTR lcg. I love ME CCG and every year in Germany they have bog even when all players gather in old German Middle Age Castle and play and have fun. This year i wonna got there. In March 2014\n\n \n\nYou should to check this game. IS very deep in Tolkien lore and also very playable solo. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90858-new-master-of-lore-article-old-forest-road/?do=findComment&comment=873919","commentId":873919,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1380013688,"content":">  \n> \n>  \n> \n> \n> \n>  \n> \n> As a Tolkien card gamer, you should at least check it out.
