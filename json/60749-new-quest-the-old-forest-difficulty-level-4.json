He wanted a quest set in the Old Forest with Old Man Willow, Tom and Goldberry. In the end we couldn't fit Tom into the story line but we did have a productive weekend and managed to do something new and cool with the quest card setup. If you've played The Mystic Wood before, you'll get the homage.\n\nThis is a fun quest that can pose different questions on each play through. It only requires access to the Core set and can be downloaded (with my other quests) here [http://www.blackmoor.org.uk/lotr.htm].\n\nPlease give it a go and let us know what you think, either here or on BGG [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/768201/the-old-forest-a-new-quest-difficulty-level-4].\n\nÂ "}]}
