The last game I ended up with both a sneak attack card and a gandalf card in my hand and this seemed an amazing combination. So i paid the 1 resource to play the sneak attack card during the combat round and as Gandalf enters play he hits a troll for four damage and then actually does his combat phase of 4 damage to the troll and then goes back into my hand at the end of the phase. I figure i'm playing this right but it just seemed too good to be true. Anyone interpret those cards differently?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75909-n00b-question/?do=findComment&comment=736621","commentId":736621,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1355944294,"content":"The way you played seems fine to me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75909-n00b-question/?do=findComment&comment=736624","commentId":736624,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1355944397,"content":"Yes, that's a playable combo. However, you say that Gandalf did another 4 damage to the troll. Did you buff his strength or something or maybe you did not count the troll's defense?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75909-n00b-question/?do=findComment&comment=736689","commentId":736689,"userName":"flightmaster101","timestamp":1355952288,"content":"J0shjames said:\n\nHey guys,\n\nI've just been playing with the core set so far and just had one basic question.

I'm sure I'll have a few more questions as I'm noticing that generally the rules are pretty well laid out but there are a few cards i'm trying to understand the timing on but I'll at least give it a shot on my own before blasting a bunch of basic questions. Thanks again!"}]}
