Sorry, have to say that.\n\nPer the user ratings at the quest companion, it's right next to Journey Along the Anduin.  It's rated 5.4, Journey is 5.3, and Passage is 2.2.  There's really no comparison between starting with the Forest Spider/Old Forest Road combination (regardless of the number of players) and X unique locations, each player starting with an engaged enemy, and a quest you lose if you don't have progress on the first stage to remove, even on round one.  Indeed the Umbar Sentries shows a good deal of enemy creep -- 1/2/1/3 is a bit heftier than first cycle surgers but not especially scary -- unless you can't afford to remove progress from the main quest, boosting their attack to 4.  Ufthak (after the first turn) and Ungoliant's Spawn are the *only* enemies with attack over 3 in Passage.  Oh and the Sentries have archery, because why not pile on the damage?\n\nIt's a fair point that beating Umbar isn't a demonstration that a deck is powerful, unlike some other quests where beating it is impressive by itself (e.g. Black Serpent).  But Seastan didn't make that claim -- he said he tested against Escape, it *crushed* that quest, *and* he could tell that it could beat more difficult quests also.  I haven't tried the deck myself, but if Seastan calls a deck \"consistently strong\" I'm inclined to take that at face value.\n\nAfter all, it *is* a Vilya deck, and we all know what that can do.  All the unique cards being 1x is a common feature in Vilya decks under normal conditions, because that way they never whiff.  The main handicap compared to a normal Vilya deck is being unable to include 3 copies of your key card, but with the hero choices allowing Heed the Dream and Word of Command to be played turn one -- and to play Vilya also, due to the contract -- that's somewhat mitigated."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310174-council-of-the-wise-what-am-i-missing/?do=findComment&comment=3969686","commentId":3969686,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1596503538,"content":"> On 8/1/2020 at 6:14 PM, asgardianphil said:\n> \n> I love the art.  It ends there. \n> \n>  \n\nYou know what?

Rather, the gameplay experience is what I used, i.e. how quickly I found the key cards, how quickly I filled up my table, etc. The quest itself was just to provide some structure. I could do the same thing with no quest at all in front of me (goldfishing), but I happen to like that quest a lot.\n\nAnd based on this experience (not the victory), I could tell it was a top tier deck, capable of beating much harder quests. I've played the game enough by now to be able to get an idea of deck's capabilities after a little bit of goldfishing. I'm sure many of you have as well.\n\nBut just in case you don't care about all that, and only care about wins, I took the deck up against Nightmare Carn Dum, and beat it on the first attempt in 7 rounds, with a final threat of just 30. In other words, crushed it. It's a top tier deck. But that should never have been in doubt. In case you've forgotten how good Vilya is, this was my board state at the beginning of the second quest phase.\n\nOCTGN_SBcq2QJmUw.png [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/453351730428510228/746436375720493056/OCTGN_SBcq2QJmUw.png]\n\nAnd this was the final turn:\n\nOCTGN_3LUrmUsCp3.png [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/453351730428510228/746437383154565127/OCTGN_3LUrmUsCp3.png]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310174-council-of-the-wise-what-am-i-missing/?do=findComment&comment=3978530","commentId":3978530,"userName":"asgardianphil","timestamp":1598288671,"content":"Thank you for all your input.

If you need a strong deck to beat LoS a Vilya deck with Elrond is a good idea since Elrond really helps with his healing.

By far it’s spurred me to build more decks than the other contracts, and all my council decks are pretty different from typical fare from what is posted on ringsdb. A good deal of criticism about this card boils down to “I wish this were a contract that lets me play my usual style, but stronger,” and I can see where the disappointment would come in, if that’s what you’re looking for in a contract (Burglar’s turn suffers the same fate)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310174-council-of-the-wise-what-am-i-missing/?do=findComment&comment=3980795","commentId":3980795,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1598662367,"content":"Caleb's approach to design often seems to be:\n\n1- For encounter cards, look at what players are doing in the current meta, then design some quests for the next cycle that defeats that strategy (penalty for large hand size, penalty for ally swarm, throw in a card here or there to defeat a voltron deck, etc)\n\n2-For player cards, look at what kind of decks people are not playing, then create room for those decks (monosphere decks, decks that engage and then don't kill enemies, decks that aim to remove their own allies from play, etc.).  Keep in mind: there were reasons to do all of those things before card design made them more desirable, but people weren't doing them. (why keep enemies in play? Forest Snare prevents it from coming back. Once Dunedain hit the scene , you had a plethora of more reasons to keep them around. Why play monosphere? Resource management is more efficient. Some cards enhancing monosphere decks pushed this further).\n\n \n\nCouncil of the Wise promotes a deck type that is pretty much absent from LotR LCG (1x decks).  If you can get past the idea that \"consistency is defined as drawing the same card or set of cards in every game,\" this contract is more palatable. Consistency might instead be defined as \"drawing cards that perform the same function/role in every game.\"  You can't easily build a deck around a single card interaction (Vilya), you have to spend energy compensating for the limitations of CotW in order to do that (for example: add deck searching items and have a less-than-ideal setup because you end up keeping Heed the Dream and paying 4 to get Vilya into hand instead of starting with it in your hand).  Instead, if you build your deck around generalities, like \"readying\" and \"healing\" and \"willpower ally\" and \"attacking ally,\" you can build a pretty good deck that's not reliant on drawing a specific card.\n\n \n\nI've been using the benefit of the deck (reward for playing events) as a resource and draw engine, filling up the deck with around 25 0- and 1-cost events, and usually going tri-sphere to allow access to more 0- and 1-cost events.  I think what I'll experiment with next is allowing myself to use more expensive events, but do something crazy like monosphere, to make it easier to play the higher cost ones I do get, without hamstringing my ability to play other important cards in my hand like allies.  \n\n \n\nAnyway, I really like the level of experimentation this contract has driven me into.\n\nEdited August 29 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310174-council-of-the-wise-what-am-i-missing/?do=findComment&comment=3981866","commentId":3981866,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1598913303,"content":"Yeah its a lot of fun. I have made 2 decks with this contract and I really enjoyed being able to include events that always got squeezed out of regular decks. Now they are so playable.\n\nRumour from the earth is a great example. In regular decks people would much rather include Henemarth and be done with it, but now the event is giving you an added bonus, and its repeatable. I have included many seldom used events like Dawn take you All and Fresh Tracks and had great fun using them. You just never know what your gonna draw.\n\nMy 1 deck had Gloin using well preserved with the One Ring, so that was easy for set-up. He was accompanied by Beorn and Smeagol, who combo nicely (smeagol turns into stinker, undefended Gloin, make $, Beorn swats him... Repeat)."}]}
