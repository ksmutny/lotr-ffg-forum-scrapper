So my first question is, should we count 0 for the Hero's cost or the Threat cost.\n\nMy second question: whenever you defeat a Nameless with a Hero attached, is your hero considered death? Might be important for your score. (Kind of Cruel you need to kill your own Heroes ^^)\n\n \n\nGreetz\n\nEdited September 2, 2014 by Jban"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120946-foundations-of-stone-nameless-hero-question/?do=findComment&comment=1243267","commentId":1243267,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1409645114,"content":"Yes to both.\n\nThe rules becomes fuzzy there if you try to look for more complicated situation, but those two, we have confirmation from Caleb."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120946-foundations-of-stone-nameless-hero-question/?do=findComment&comment=1243273","commentId":1243273,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1409645545,"content":"thanks for the quick answer, was a question that was in my mind for a long time. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120946-foundations-of-stone-nameless-hero-question/?do=findComment&comment=1243289","commentId":1243289,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1409646545,"content":"Woah.
