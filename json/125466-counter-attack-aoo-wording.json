If it did read 'must either' you'd have a choice, where you have to fulfil one of the two completely, as per the FAQ etc., and it would work perfectly well.

I just apply the \"must either X or Y\" rule on those cards.\n\nIt isn't completely with the rules, but because the rules make no sense on these cards, I found this most correct.
