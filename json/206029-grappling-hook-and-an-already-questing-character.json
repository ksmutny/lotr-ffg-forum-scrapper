Consider hero Treebeard with Ent Draught, Elf-friend, and Grappling Hook. After staging, you can damage him 5 times to boost his stats to 7WP/8ATK, play Fair and Perilous to bring that attack to 15, then use Grappling Hook for a mad amount of questing. Or, more simply, Grappling Hook on anyone resource-flush (Mablung? anyone with Steward of Gondor?) with a few copies of Gondorian Fire. It's a kind of crazy card, given the attack boosts we already have in the card pool."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206029-grappling-hook-and-an-already-questing-character/?do=findComment&comment=2112541","commentId":2112541,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1458398383,"content":"People asked about double-committing characters to the quest way back in the core set days, since it seems like such a natural thing to do with core Aragorn's ability.  Can't be done though.  I don't recall if it's in the FAQ but I'm sure someone could dig up a ruling if you're curious.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206029-grappling-hook-and-an-already-questing-character/?do=findComment&comment=2112549","commentId":2112549,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1458398676,"content":"It can't be done in the case of Core Set Aragorn specifically because there is no moment in the game where it would be possible---even if being committed twice was allowed, Core Aragorn has no right to do it.

I don't recall if it's in the FAQ but I'm sure someone could dig up a ruling if you're curious.\n\nI always assumed that the reason you couldn't double-commit Aragorn was that there only one \"instant\" during which a player could commit characters to the quest, so even if you readied him, it was already too late to re-commit him.\n\nCome to think of it, though, it seems like that'd let you Desperate Alliance him over to the next player and allow Aragorn to be committed again IF double-committing is allowed.

But if the framework allows multiple commitments, I suppose you could still Desperate Alliance over a hero with Steed of Imladris attached and thus activate its trigger one more time. But that makes Desperate Alliance into something akin to a differently-timed Strength of Will that requires a discard instead of a character exhaustion. Not sure if that's really broken.\n\nEdited March 20, 2016 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206029-grappling-hook-and-an-already-questing-character/?do=findComment&comment=2113264","commentId":2113264,"userName":"awp832","timestamp":1458437895,"content":"I'm going to go with #3 as well.   \n\nElf Friend+ LoV + Theodred = infinite resources otherwise."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206029-grappling-hook-and-an-already-questing-character/?do=findComment&comment=2113391","commentId":2113391,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1458448038,"content":"> I'm going to go with #3 as well.   \n> \n> Elf Friend+ LoV + Theodred = infinite resources otherwise.\n\n \n\nThere seems to be a misconception here. This was already stated above, but I'll quote the core rules directly this time...\n\n \n\n> Each player may commit characters to the current quest card. Characters are exhausted when they commit to a quest. Players commit characters to the quest as a team, starting with the first player, and then proceeding clockwise around the table. Each player may commit as many of his characters to the quest as he would like.\n\n \n\nEach player has but ONE opportunity to commit characters to the quest. Thus, even with Light of Valinor, Theodred cannot be infinitely committed to generate infinite resources, since that would require committing him an infinite number of discrete times. It is the same reason Core Aragorn cannot be double-committed through his ability, even after readying.\n\n \n\nNote that the above reasoning makes no assumption about whether a character is fundamentally barred from being double-committed or not. The issue with Grappling Hook is that it provides a new, out-of-framework way of committing a character to the quest and thus creates an issue that forces us to answer once and for all whether a character is allowed to be double-committed. (AFAICT, Desperate Alliance played on a questing hero with Light of Valinor and Steed of Imladris attached can also raise this issue, but that's such a corner case that it hasn't been considered before.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206029-grappling-hook-and-an-already-questing-character/?do=findComment&comment=2113474","commentId":2113474,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1458455132,"content":"During my ONE opportunity to commit characters to the quest, I commit Glorfindel, who is eligible because he is ready, then I commit Glorfindel, who is eligible because he is ready, then I commit Glorfindel, who is eligible because he is ready........
