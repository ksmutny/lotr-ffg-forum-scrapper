To clarify: a character is made unconscious once he is fully poisoned but should a character that is made unconscious, as in stage three, be automatically fully poisoned aswell (ie add poison cards then discard them)\n\nThe reason for my confusion follows: If the two are separate then Beorn would fall unconscious but if they aren't then Beorn would not as he can't have poison attachments"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221182-hobbit-on-the-doorstep-making-a-character-unconscious/?do=findComment&comment=2239261","commentId":2239261,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1464454976,"content":"No, if a card effect just tells you to make a character unconscious, there is no need to discard cards from your deck to fulfill a poison effect. Â You just do precisely what the card tells you do to and no more, so you simply make the character unconscious with no extra steps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221182-hobbit-on-the-doorstep-making-a-character-unconscious/?do=findComment&comment=2239272","commentId":2239272,"userName":"The Thing In The Attic","timestamp":1464455608,"content":"Cool. I thought as much, but looking at the card thematically (ie the spiders capturing all of the characters)I wasn't so sure.\n\nFirst game I got battered by the spiders at this point. I'm going to have another go at it tomorrow."}]}
