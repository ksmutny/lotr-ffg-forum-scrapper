A card that gives a hero another 'icon' such as mind, tactics, leadership or so, does that hero generate 2 tokens (1 of each type - his own and the attachment's) or do his powertokens merely count for both colors?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54303-multicolor-hero/?do=findComment&comment=538028","commentId":538028,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1317907033,"content":"He still only generates 1 token per turn.

Here, we are looking at a hero that would generate two resources without conditions. That would be a monstrously powerful ability, as the game already has a number of ways to add card draw, and nothing beats having a bunch of cards in your hand and having the resources to play them. In the early stages of this game, it seems that the designers have limited the ways in which you can add extra resources, though. Let's see what happens as, no doubt, more resource oriented cards will eventually be released. "}]}
