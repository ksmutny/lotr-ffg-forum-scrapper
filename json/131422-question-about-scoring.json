The answer is on p. 9 of the official FAQ (http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4]) -- I highly recommend you take a look at that document, as it may answer other (but not all) questions you may have about the game:\n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition to all elements currently used to score a game, players also add an additional 10 points to their “final group score” for each round of play that is taken to defeat a scenario. Players tally each round for their score at the end of the refresh phase.\n\nEdited January 10, 2015 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131422-question-about-scoring/?do=findComment&comment=1400789","commentId":1400789,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1420925571,"content":"oh! ok.  I counted it at the end of the game, starting at one round and going up one at the end.  so I guess I'll just start a 0! thanks guys!"}]}
