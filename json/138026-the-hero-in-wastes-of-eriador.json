Halbarad and Aragorn are Leadership and Tactics and the Mount Gram hero is confirmed to be Lore, so there's definitely room for at least one more Spirit hero in Angmar Awakened. I probably wouldn't play an Arwen hero unless she has a spectacular ability since I really like the ally version, but I see why others would want her."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/138026-the-hero-in-wastes-of-eriador/?do=findComment&comment=1505716","commentId":1505716,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1427294185,"content":"> Well they had me fooled.\n\nFool of a Took! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nEdited March 25, 2015 by PocketWraith"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/138026-the-hero-in-wastes-of-eriador/?do=findComment&comment=1505768","commentId":1505768,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1427295771,"content":"Círdan, the ultimate lore break."}]}
