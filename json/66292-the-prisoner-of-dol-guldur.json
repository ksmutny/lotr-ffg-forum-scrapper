When your hero becomes a prisoner, what is the definition of  \"Used\"?

That happens in the resource phase of the first turn, by which time the prisoner has been determined.\n\nIn general, I think the reason the loose and ill-defined term \"used\" is on this quest card is because the designers were not templating cards very precisely in the core set - there are other examples too. This has tightened up somewhat in the current cycle. The phrasing you suggest would have been better, I think (\"remove from the game\").\n\nAnother related question is whether you can place a Caught in a Web on the prisoner."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66292-the-prisoner-of-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=647431","commentId":647431,"userName":"Captain Poe","timestamp":1340284012,"content":"jjeagle said:\n\n \n\nFirstly, you don't collect resources during set up.

For some reason I had been giving my heroes their +1 resource when I draw the starting hand, which is not right.\n\nI would also like to know about caught in the web. Its not technically using the hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66292-the-prisoner-of-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=647433","commentId":647433,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1340284190,"content":"I think the point is that \"technically using the hero\" doesn't really mean anything, because \"using\" is not defined properly as a rules term.
