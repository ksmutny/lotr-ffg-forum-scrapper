Otherwise Treebeard is a solid 7/8/3/5, Quickbeam can ready roughly twice as much, Erkenbrand gets as good as the un-erata'd Burning Brand was!\n\nI ask this very question to Calab some time ago.\n\nDamaging Erkenbrand is part of the cost to trigger his response. If you negate that damage then you won't be able to trigger it. I'm assuming the same holds true to any ally/hero with an effect that triggers when you damage it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305974-self-inflicted-damage-and-mirthril-shirt/?do=findComment&comment=3897508","commentId":3897508,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1582120629,"content":"I would assume that if you reroute the damage, that's an issue too?
