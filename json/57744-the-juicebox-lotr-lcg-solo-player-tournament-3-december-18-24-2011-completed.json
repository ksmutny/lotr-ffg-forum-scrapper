This week’s tournament marks the beginning of a series of tournaments that will focus on the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].\n\nWill you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. Further, please refrain from using this thread for extensive theorizing and/or conversation that is not directly related to this particular tournament. Nothing against other conversations – it’s just, that’s what other threads are for. Specifically, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104&efpag=0].\n\nAnd now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!\n\nSolo Player Tournament #3:\n\nQuest: The Hunt for Gollum\nDeck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + HfG Adventure Pack\nNumber of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck\n\nTop Ten:\n\n1. muemakan ~ 51 (Éowyn, Aragon, Théodred)\n2. leptokurt ~ 53 (Éowyn, Théodred, Bilbo)\n3.

I'm just wondering what Juicy did to get his threat to 43?!?\n\n \n\n \n\nSince Quest Card 2B requires revealing 2 cards off the encounter deck and adding 1 to the staging area at the beginning of the quest phase, when presented with the option of adding Hunters from Mordor (I had 2 Clue cards in play) or Pursued by Shadows, I chose PbS. It's a devastating card at that point because it's the beginning of the quest phase and no one has committed yet to the quest. But at the time, it felt like the less brutal of my options.\n\nI believe I also had another Pursued by Shadows come off the encounter deck naturally at a time when I had left a few characters standing ready for battle.\n\nFurther, I'm pretty sure I encountered some Flooding along the way.\n\nThese Treachery cards really can be treacherous!\n\nIn any case, it made for a pretty thrilling (read as \"threat was skyrocketing\") ride.\n\nThanks for your curiosity. Éowyn, Beravor, and Glorfindel sure appreciate your care and concern about their wellbeing. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\nPS: As a cool \"thematic\" moment, I can actually remember getting so annoyed by PbS, and thinking, \"Geez, why is this card so brutal?\" Then I studied it further and realized that in that moment there was actually a Nazgul searching the skies for me, and I had an actual feeling of relief wash over me as I thought, \"Okay, this makes perfect sense now. I guess I'm actually just quite lucky to be out of his reach!\" I could even hear (in my mind) the croaking screams of the Nazgul (from the movie) braying in the skies above. It was a pretty fun moment, and one more reason I continue to enjoy this game so much."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57744-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-3-december-18-24-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=569007","commentId":569007,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1324226357,"content":"Cool, I had such a \"ride\" myself - 3 Hunters, 2 cluecards - but my fellowship made it.\n\n \n\nOk, back to the results that count:\n\n \n\nHeroes: Théodred, Bilbo, Èowyn\n\nThreat: 16\n\nHero Wounds: 0\n\nVictory Points: 3\n\nRound Tracker: 80\n\nTotal: 93\n\n \n\nMy deck had it all - Steward of Gonor, 2x Sneak Attack /Gandalf, Northern Tracker and Daughter of the Nimrodel played in round 2, Faramir in round 4, 2 x Galadrim's Greeting.

Ah, just the beginning of the threat climbing (thematically delightful though, when you think about it). Oh, and later on in Quest Card 2B, I lost my Clue card because of Evil Storm.

Try to limit combats to a minimum, as the shadow effects (Hunter) can ruin a good result. That means of course good threat management. Don't let your threat get at 30 or higher. Northern Tracker is a must, especially when you combine him with some Snowborn Scouts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57744-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-3-december-18-24-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=569398","commentId":569398,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1324309254,"content":" In my win I had 2 northern trackers, a Lorien guide, and faramir.  But I didn't get them in as early as you guys did.  Once in though, they and the others definitely sped things up!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57744-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-3-december-18-24-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=569500","commentId":569500,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1324324187,"content":" Two wins today, but the first was only a 130.  The second though I almost broke 100!  Got a 103---final threat 25; 1 damage; 3victory points; 7 rounds.  Heroes:  theodred; Eleanor; eowyn.  Slightly different deck than yesterday."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57744-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-3-december-18-24-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=569503","commentId":569503,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1324324414,"content":" Ok---so now the flu running rampant through our house is affecting my mind---I just did break a 100!!!   I got a 93!!!  (juice box---how do I delete my last comment where I now look like a fool!!!). babeo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/babeo.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57744-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-3-december-18-24-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=569523","commentId":569523,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1324328606,"content":"Zjb12 said:\n\n(juice box---how do I delete my last comment where I now look like a fool!!!). babeo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/babeo.gif]\n\n\n\nUnfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), I don't have the power to delete comments.\n\nCongrats on the new score though!

So Banjs get placed at the top of the encounter deck before you draw your encounter.\n\n \n\n \n\nOk, so I abandoned my lore/tactics deck which wasn't made for good results. I built a leadership/lore deck afterwards which did not idisappoint me, but needs good early draws to get a good result.

Had to use Gandalf's ability plus a Dunedain pimped Glóin who was fighting for Gondor to get rid of the beast. Théodred and Glóin plus Steward of Gondor on Beravor assured  a nice flow of resources which was much needed as I drew all three Old Wive's Tales as encounters.

Protector of Lórien came in round 2. In my 2X th attempt for this tournament i finally got Treacherous Fog in the setup phase (instead of HoM). Got one clue in the first round, one in the second. I sent everyone questing each round. Got Pursued by Shadow twice - and here is a question: the second one I got as the forced effect of 1B. I didn't raise my threat by 3, but I am not sure if this was correct. Does the forced effect still belong to the questing phase? If not, my result would be 56. \n\n\n\nI understand the Forced effect on Stage 1B as still part of the Quest Phase based on the following from the FAQ (1.24):\n\nAny Forced or passive effects initiated by questing successfully resolve before physically placing progress tokens.\n\nSince placing the tokens marks the end of the Quest Resolution, I think your score of 53 stands. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\n \n\nOn another note... looks like many of you had a pretty wild day of adventuring!\nSo much action and movement in the Top Ten.
