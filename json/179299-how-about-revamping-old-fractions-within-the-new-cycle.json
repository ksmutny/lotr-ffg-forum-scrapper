(new Valor effect and doomed keyword, anyone?! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])\n\n \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nEdited June 4, 2015 by Flrbb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/179299-how-about-revamping-old-fractions-within-the-new-cycle/?do=findComment&comment=1647972","commentId":1647972,"userName":"OlorinCZ","timestamp":1433408390,"content":"The next cycle wil probably take place in North-East (Mirkwood, Dale, Erebor, Iron mountains,....). Or I would think so, it is the last part of the Middle-earth well explored by books and not by this game (or not that much, Shadows of Mirkwood was somewhat there).And this is an excellent opportunity. \n\nSo Thranduil (I personally really really hope for him. He and Cirdan are characters I miss the most) for Silvan elfs, more dwarves (Dain's son? ) who live there, Eagles, Dale, more Beornings (with Grimbeorn), Woodland men? (Or even Roac or other ravens?  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] more creatures for Radagast)\n\nOr new Radagast hero himself? \n\n \n\n****...now you made me exited for things do not even exist  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nEdited June 4, 2015 by OlorinCZ"}]}
