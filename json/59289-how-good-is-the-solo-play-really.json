I have played about 20 games solo...of the 20 i have played, i have only played 3 different quests...each game was totally different. Despite knowing the quests ahead of time (what you have to accomplish) the random draw of encounter cards and your player deck really makes each game different.\n\nLCG in my opinion doesn't change the game play itself. LCG effects how you get new cards (everyone has access to adventure packs and everyone gets the same card in each pack as the next guy). Unlike magic, where you have to keep buying to get the card you really are looking for, you buy the APs and you get the cards. Simple enough.\n\nfor me, solo play is the best. However, the fact that you can play two player by just controlling both sets of hero's makes it that much more flexible.\n\nAs far as the difficulty, it depends on the quest. There are a few that are so hard solo (1 set of Hero's). But, as a single player, you have the option of tackling a quest controlling both players hands (6 hero's).\n\nJust my thoughts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59289-how-good-is-the-solo-play-really/?do=findComment&comment=582439","commentId":582439,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1327077630,"content":"This game is very good in multiplayer; not doubt, but, in my opinion, it shines the most when playing solo.\n\n \n\nWhether you play it using the core rules with 1 or 2 decks or if you use the unofficial  5-Heroes rule, you'll see how fun this game really is.\n\nEvery single time I open my box, I play through all scenarios; Passage through Mirkwood (first scenario) is easy, but is a good way to introduce the game.

You can see this in the quests in almost every scenario.Now I am not saying that solo play is bad, in fact I think it is one of the better solitaire games that I know of. Though I think that the co-op play is leaps and bounds more fun, the interplay between your friends, as you make your plans, the more complex card interactions, the much more uncontrollable encounter deck.. everything is just better imo.\n\nStill, I think solo play is good enough to warrant a purchase. It is still very challenging and fun solo, though the complexity of the rules means that you will often be playing completely wrong for much of the time when you start out, in 2+ player games you can kind of \"check\" each other.. but in solo it is easy to forget something or just have a rule wrong.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59289-how-good-is-the-solo-play-really/?do=findComment&comment=582488","commentId":582488,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1327085885,"content":"I enjoy the game a lot in solo play, but I've had a lot more luck in some quests than others.\n\nHere's my very basic take on how each of the quests from the core and first set of boosters works for solo play:\n\n(BIG CAVEAT! I generally have three or four player decks waiting on hand and I don't tailor my decks for specific quests so I don't play in the most optomized fashion.)\n\n \n\nPassage Through Mirkwood- Like all of the core set quests, this one is more challenging in solo play than in multiplayer, but still usually win-able, even by a novice. Since there are two possible end stages, it provides an extra degree of uncertainty that can help make it fun to revisit. I still use it from time to time to try out new deck concepts and have frequently found myself surprised to have a more challenging game than I had anticipated.\n\n \n\nJourney Along the Anduin- Again, this one is a lot more challenging in solo play and a lot of players have reported serious difficulty with it. I had lots of success against it the first few times I played, but then lost against it just yesterday when trying out some new decks. It's definitely a challenge, but certainly do-able. The rules allow you to take a single mulligan with your opening hand, consider doing just that if you don't draw a \"Feint\" or \"Forest Snare\" or something that can help you deal with that Hill Troll. I've found that if you can quickly and efficiently deal with the troll, then the rest of the quest tends to go pretty smoothly.\n\n \n\nEscape From Dol Guldur- I reluctantly admit that I've never even attempted to play solo. I've *heard* of it being beaten solo, but I'm pretty sure that wasn't with just a copy of the sore set.\n\n \n\nThe Hunt for Gollum- Very playable in solo. I'd say generally easier than Journey Along the Anduin, but can still provide some challenge.\n\n \n\nConflict at the Carrock- *I've* never beaten it solo, but I've also heard from others who have. I suspect this one is a lot easier if you tailor a deck towards defeating it.\n\n \n\nA Journey to Rhosgobel- This one is also very challenging. Not *as* hard in solo play as Escape from Dol Guldur, but still pretty darn difficult. Make sure you have a way to heal Wilyador besides getting Aethelas and a way to cancel treachery cards. I need to try it again with a tailored deck.\n\n \n\nThe Hills of Emyn Muil- The first time I tried this quest it was solo with a Spirit/Rohan deck (nearly a redundant phrase) and it absolutely destroyed the quest. Easiest game of LotR I'd ever played. It's been a more interesting challenge with other decks. This isn't a very popular quest and it's easy to understand why. I do find this one, in particular, more enjoyable in solo than in multiplayer as it tends to get especially tiresome as multiplayer makes more and more locations come into play.\n\n \n\nThe Dead Marshes- This is a pretty good quest (although, I suggest just giving up and starting over if Gollum ever ends up buried in your discard pile) and one I've enjoyed a lot in both solo game and multiplayer. I won pretty handily in my first solo game with a mostly Spirit deck and had a very nail-biting narrow victory my second time with a mostly Lore deck.\n\n \n\nReturn to Mirkwood- This is a very challenging quest for solo play, although in some ways it gets a bit balanced as there are negative affects that won't come into play since you're the only player guarding Gollum. Two things: Your Threat will go up a minimum of four every turn! And the third stage won't let you play any cards from your hand, so try to get a lot on the table before you get to it. I lost quickly on my first solo play, in large part due to drawing a Hill Troll right away (I was at nearly 40 threat by the end of the second turn). The second time, I came within just a couple progress tokens of victory; I was so very close...then I drew that dang Hill Troll again, alongside everything else that was out at the time, I was overwhelmed and lost. The main solo player on the Cardboard of the Rings podcast rated this one a solid \"rage quit\", but with the right deck, careful playing, and a bit of luck, it certainly can be done.\n\n \n\nI don't have Massing at Osgillioth or Khazad-Dum.\n\n \n\nI love the customization and variability (and the theme) of this game. I rarely play computer/video games, I tend to tire of the quickly, but the LotR card game keeps bringing me back, both for multiplayer and solo games."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59289-how-good-is-the-solo-play-really/?do=findComment&comment=582489","commentId":582489,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1327085943,"content":"booored said:\n\nStill, I think solo play is good enough to warrant a purchase.

Most people agree that Hills of Emyn Muil is boring and Return to Mirkwood is very hard when playing solo. Any of the others would work fine. I'd recommend Conflict at the Carrock.

(Multiple decks with three copies of Gandalf in each, etc.)\n\n \n\nFor the Mirkwood cycle of expansions, I'd say that half of them felt like they were important for the \"story\".\n\nThe Hunt for Gollum is about trying to track the little bugger.\n\nThe Dead Marshes is about running him to ground.\n\nReturn to Mirkwood is about keeping him captive and trying to bring him back (alive) to King Thranduil.\n\nThe rest feel more like side quests that have little if anything to do with the larger narrative.\n\nConflict at Carrock is about fighting some Trolls and Journey to Rhosgobel is about keeping an eagle from dying. They are two very difficult, but solid quests and are very popular. Part of their popularity may even have to do with feeling like they're their own story and not just part of a larger one.\n\nThe Hills of Emyn Muil is ostensibly about getting back on Gollum's trail, but while Hunt for Gollum had you searching for clues relating to his trail, Hills of Emyn Muil is just going to a bunch of locations without much of a narrative framework.\n\n \n\nEven so, I have a hard time saying which ones are the best to skip as they all have useful cards that often relate to cards from other packs. For instance, the four main \"Song\" cards are sprinkled throughout the packs and I think each one had one or two Rohan cards and one or two Eagle cards. If you're interested in decks built around either of those, it could behoove you to get all or most of them. Also, if you get Khazad-Dum and want to make some Dwarf decks then you should *seriously* consider picking up Return to Mirkwood for the Dain Ironfoot hero. \n\nThere are lists of all the contents for each pack online: http://lotrlcg.com/ [http://lotrlcg.com/]\n\nAlso there are in-depth reviews of each up on Amazon.\n\n \n\nHave fun!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59289-how-good-is-the-solo-play-really/?do=findComment&comment=583041","commentId":583041,"userName":"arcticfox2","timestamp":1327222400,"content":" Thanks again for all your replies.
