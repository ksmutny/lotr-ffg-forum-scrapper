If you're at 49 threat at the start of the round, you can choose to not commit anyone to the quest, and let the staging area blow you away.... only to return back to 45. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/179121-the-battle-of-carn-d%C3%BBm/?do=findComment&comment=1645794","commentId":1645794,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1433263031,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > I am hugely disappointed by Hold Your Ground, though.

I hardly have more than a few in a deck. The most I can think of is either in a Gondor deck with Beregond and Gondorian Spearman but the latter usually dies before he can get ready (though when timed right, this could be an option) or an Eagle deck with Landroval and Winged Guardian (too bad Beorn is immune). Well, we shall see, I am skeptical about this one.\n\nEdited June 2, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/179121-the-battle-of-carn-d%C3%BBm/?do=findComment&comment=1645796","commentId":1645796,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1433263193,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > Favour of the Valar is intriguing, too.

I still hardly ever threat out with my Valour deck, and I find Gandalf a much better option (when played from hand he only is 2 more cost and much more versatile). The best quest to use this now seems against the Secluded Homestead. I hardly ever clear it from the staging area and I have just threat-out because of it with one of my decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/179121-the-battle-of-carn-d%C3%BBm/?do=findComment&comment=1645810","commentId":1645810,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1433263586,"content":"What do you all think about Doom Hangs Still?
