In the books there is evidence that he can and does take physical form. Gollum mentions the four fingers on his black hand ('they are enough'); several times characters talk about him 'coming forth' or 'arriving' after his servants have won the day. Moreover, the Red Eye is not his physical form but an embodiment or visual representation of his ceaseless Will that goes here and there.\n\n \n\nThe confusion sets in because Sauron, like Gandalf and some of the Noldor, exists in both the spirit realm and the physical realm simultaneously. Sauron seems to be the superior power in that he has the most experience in manipulating both the physical and the spiritual. He's been at this for Ages. And its his evil Will (spiritual power) that literally holds the Dark Tower together. It keeps the Nine in their power, keeps all of the evil creatures in his control fighting. Men worship him as their lord and god. He is a master of deception, strategy, and treachery. Its his cunning and desire for domination that culminates the greatest events of two Ages.\n\n \n\nFor that reason, he's got to be the most powerful being in the Third Age.\n\n \n\nThis is, of course, entirely subjective. 'Uncloaked', Gandalf would surely be Sauron's equal, if not superior. The White Council, united as one, stood against him and drove him out of Dol Guldur (though he was not quite as 'energized' then). And Sauron's critical misstep was, of course, the creation of the Ring. He put all of his eggs in one basket.\n\n \n\nAnyways, there is a lot of interesting talk on him in Tolkien's letters and more that could be said but this little post went way longer than I meant for it to. Good discussion! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98497-top-ten-most-powerful-middle-earth-characters-3rd-age/?do=findComment&comment=981833","commentId":981833,"userName":"Gunny_J","timestamp":1392144323,"content":"Sauron, without a doubt, was the mightiest spirit to dwell in Middle-earth.  It is written in the Silmarillian he is the greatest of all the Maiar.  So much so, the Vala sent five other Maiar (the Istari) to keep the Great Darkness at bay in Middle-earth.  In addition, second to him in power, were the Balrogs - also Maiar, but corrupted by Morgoth.  Obviously, Gandalf defeated a Balrog, which automatically illustrates he is equal in power.  Saruman would have similar power, if not greater, so I would group him in there somewhere at the top. \n\n \n\nTo say Sauron had no real power is far-fetched.  It took an army led by Celeborn, Galadriel, and Saruman to make Sauron consider fleeing Dol Guldur back to Barad-dur and that was when he was in his weaker, necromancer form.  By the time of the War of the Ring took place, he was easily more powerful than any living being in Middle-earth, with the exception of Tom Bombadil.  However, the only real chance they had in defeating Sauron himself was destroying the ring of power.  The only reason I bring Tom Bombadil into this is because his origin is unclear as he could have been an AWOL Vala for all we know.  IMO, Bombadil's power was greater than any other good living being, but maybe not greater than Sauron. \n\n \n\nWith much of Sauron's power, the Witch-king was very strong, but I would not be willing to bet he could defeat Gandalf.  If you think about it, if he was, he would have tried at the gates to Minas Tirith.  Gandalf was his single greatest threat and obstacle to winning that battle.  Had he smitten Gandalf right there and then, the battle would have been over.  WIthout the White Wizard, they would have lost all will and hope to win the fight.  I think that Peter Jackson's movies give a warped sense of the hiearchy of the characters, especially with The Hobbit movies.  I do love the movies, though.\n\n \n\nI think people bring up an interest point about Shelob.  Ungoliant dwelled with Morgoth, a Vala, and become so powerful that even he feared her.  Her offspring could certainly be more powerful than a Maiar, but with her defeat to one Samwise Gamgee it is hard to say.  I just don't see Samwise defeating any other person of power that would make my list, so I just can't include Shelob.  Not to mention, Samwise used powers provided by Galadriel to defeat Shelob...probably couldn't have done it without.\n\n \n\nWith that said, I would go in this order as top ten:\n\n \n\nSauron (greatest of all the Maiar)\n\nTom Bombadil (possibly a greater Maiar or Vala but uncertain)\n\nThe 5 Istari (Maiar wizards sent by the Vala)\n\nBalrog (great Maiar)\n\nGaladriel (immortal Elf)\n\nCeleborn (immortal Elf)\n\nEdited February 11, 2014 by Gunny_J"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98497-top-ten-most-powerful-middle-earth-characters-3rd-age/?do=findComment&comment=982840","commentId":982840,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1392226556,"content":"Not sure if I would be able to rank them.

His minions did, he couldn't do anything. Like he didn't do anything to Saruman, Saruman just gave in to his own desires for power and submitted to fear.\n> \n> And yes he did turn Saruman, through the Palantir. You think he would've just gone mad on his own?\n\n \n\nFrom the timeline in Appendix B:\n\n * 2851 - Saruman begins searching the Gladden Fields\n * 2939 - Saruman learns that Sauron's agents are also searching the Gladden Fields, and therefore deduces that Sauron has tracked the Ring there. He does not inform the White Council.\n * 2953 - At the last meeting of the White Council, Saruman claims that the Ring was swept into the sea. He also begins spying on Gandalf and installing his agents around the Shire.\n * c. 3000 - Saruman first uses the palantir and is \"ensnared by Sauron.\"\n\nIt's clear that Saruman was already heading down a dark path, and his communion with Sauron merely hastened the decay. The books don't mention when he first learned of Isildur's fate, but he's taking concrete steps to secure the Ring for himself a century and a half before he uses the palantir. Sauron's influence is not insignificant--Saruman switches from patient opportunism and espionage to overt warfare--but he already had a foothold in the wizard's heart.\n\n \n\n> By the time of the War of the Ring took place, he was easily more powerful than any living being in Middle-earth, with the exception of Tom Bombadil.  However, the only real chance they had in defeating Sauron himself was destroying the ring of power.  The only reason I bring Tom Bombadil into this is because his origin is unclear as he could have been an AWOL Vala for all we know.  IMO, Bombadil's power was greater than any other good living being, but maybe not greater than Sauron. \n\n \n\nThe Council of Elrond briefly floats the idea of giving the Ring to Tom Bombadil for safekeeping. They reject it, in part because not even he could withstand Sauron's power forever (Glorfindel: \"Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not. I think that in the end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last as he was First, and then Night will come.\")"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98497-top-ten-most-powerful-middle-earth-characters-3rd-age/?do=findComment&comment=2517805","commentId":2517805,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1480360167,"content":"75a45dd7c7343274dcc0d25a5038faa8b9b08f5b [https://img.ifcdn.com/images/75a45dd7c7343274dcc0d25a5038faa8b9b08f5bd86b19c381a2b585de9f0d86_1.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98497-top-ten-most-powerful-middle-earth-characters-3rd-age/?do=findComment&comment=2517897","commentId":2517897,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1480362415,"content":"Power levels, or at least dangerous-ness, was brought up by Gandalf the White in the text:\n\n \n\nGimli:  \"I thought Fangorn was dangerous.\"\n\nGandalf: \"Dangerous!  And so am I, very dangerous: more dangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive before the seat of the Dark Lord.\"\n\n \n\nSo according to Gandalf, the power rankings would run:\n\n \n\n1) Sauron\n\n2) Gandalf the White\n\n \n\nFrom the text we can deduce that Saruman > Gandalf the Grey (with ring) > Durin's Bane.  Witch King tops Sauron's servants.
