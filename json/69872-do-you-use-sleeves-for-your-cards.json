Collecting all these LOTR cards from ground zero is pricey enough.\n\n\n\nUltra Pro penny sleeves for me. Yes, they are very thin, but for example, I've played 3,400+ games of WWE Raw Deal since getting that game in August 2008, haven't had to replace a single sleeve and certainly the cards inside have no sign of wear on them because they've been sleeved. I can't even imagine what they would look like without sleeves. Of course, I can say that without them being in sleeves, I wouldn't have played the game nearly as much. Not only do sleeves make shuffling easier, you can also shuffle more stress-free, knowing the edges and corners won't take any damage.\n\nIf a game uses these Magic-sized cards, like LotR LCG does, I use penny sleeves. There is no need for more expensive premium sleeves IMO, extra money is wasted since penny sleeves do the job for a lot less. It's only the non-Magic-size cards, like games that use FFG's mini and medium-sized cards (picked up Descent 2.0 this week), penny sleeves don't work with those, so for those games, have to grab more specialized sleeves, Arcane Tinmen sleeves being my sleeve of choice here (for the same price as FFG sleeves, I get 100 AT sleeves in a pack, vs 50 sleeves from FFG)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69872-do-you-use-sleeves-for-your-cards/?do=findComment&comment=681956","commentId":681956,"userName":"Troymk1","timestamp":1345906799,"content":" I use Ultra Pro premiums.\n\n \n\nI like the texture of the harder plastic, and I also use the ones that are completely clear for a uniform feel and they are much easier to cleave together to do a shuffle\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69872-do-you-use-sleeves-for-your-cards/?do=findComment&comment=681957","commentId":681957,"userName":"Cunir","timestamp":1345906822,"content":"I used to use the FFG sleeves, with the special Lord of the Rings pictures on  the back, but i have goine back to using Ultro Pro 66mm ones.\n\nI don't think the FFG ones fit very well… there are sizeable gaps around all four edges of the card, and because the inside of the sleeve is white, you get an ugly white border around all of the cards.
