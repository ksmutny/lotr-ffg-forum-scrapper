Can I use Hidden Cache response when I discarding cards from out of play deck via Searches?\n\n \n\nNo, I would think not and as such you could not trigger Hidden Cache.  Card's referring to your deck most certainly refer to your regular deck.  For example, you are not allowed to use A Very Good Tale to attempt to discard your Mugash's Guards from your out-of-play deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100420-to-catch-an-orc-question-about-discarding/?do=findComment&comment=2230736","commentId":2230736,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1464011659,"content":"I interpret it the other way - yes, you can't interact with your out-of-play deck through means which would normally allow you to interact with your deck (drawing or discarding from it through card effects), but it's still a deck which is yours, thus the wording of Hidden Cache 'your deck' seems to me like it applies. Hidden Cache is discarded from your (out-of-play) deck, I say you can trigger it. I see nothing in the rules that contradicts this, so why deny us a fun combo?\n\nThe comparison to AVGT doesn't hold up for me because that would be you directly interacting with your out-of-play deck through a player card effect, which you can't do, but when the cards get discarded from it for the Search keyword they go to your regular discard pile and you can interact with them again as normal, including (I would say) triggering Hidden Cache."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100420-to-catch-an-orc-question-about-discarding/?do=findComment&comment=2230745","commentId":2230745,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1464012001,"content":"> I interpret it the other way - yes, you can't interact with your out-of-play deck through means which would normally allow you to interact with your deck (drawing or discarding from it through card effects), but it's still a deck which is yours, thus the wording of Hidden Cache 'your deck' seems to me like it applies.
