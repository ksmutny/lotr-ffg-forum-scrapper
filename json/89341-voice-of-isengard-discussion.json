After x turns they can be used normally.\n\nAlternatively it could be, When an Ent exhausts it gains time X. Ents can only ready when they have no time counters.\n\nAlthough I like the idea of cards that can only be played when you have threat over a certain amount (or like a reverse secrecy) I'm not sure they would be a good design. Threat is basically the game's way of saying you're running out of time. Cards that get better as you run out of time would probably be too good. You can 100% rely on the end game threat state to to occur.\n\nThe only way to balance it would be if it was threat 49 (maybe 48). Which is essentially saying, do you want to hold out for the super version of the card (at the risk of losing the game if your threat spikes just before you use it). That might be good for moments of tension but might be overall bad for game play - and difficult to design for in a balanced way I think. In any case we already have the tense feeling of last second save when you're at threat 48 or 49 - making cards that just do that better is a form of power creep and probably nothing else.\n\nIn any case I want them to add card themes that are better able to resist the shadow (As a Noldor trait probably). I'm hoping to see a hero that has something like: \"For every Noldor hero you control your maximum threat before losing is increased by 2\" or even better for every Noldor in play increase your maximum threat by 1 - which would be great thematically with their allies that you have to pay cards to keep in play.\n\nYou won't fall to the shadow but eventually their low numbers will force them to retreat ... to the west. Once they start retreating you may suddenly lose - and certainly will when a critical number depart you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=852952","commentId":852952,"userName":"Rainelotr","timestamp":1377746830,"content":"> How about something like Ents enter play exhausted and don't ready until they take damage?

It's hard to put a difficulty on it after playing it once with old decks I had laying around, but I'd say it's challenging but beatable (this is two-handed, by the way)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=990645","commentId":990645,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1392921227,"content":"Sounds like a fun quest Ian.\n\nI'm so jealous that you guys are already playing these right now ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=990656","commentId":990656,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1392922306,"content":"Just out of curiosity... what Grima objective ally does?

The second scenario was the most difficult, followed by the first then the third.\n\nThe third scenario, was not as easy as others made it seem. There can be some nasty combination of encounter cards. When ever i had choice of selecting a Huorn enemy i selected the Dark-hearted one with engagement of 1, and it raises threat by 2. Having a few of them engaged can lead to threat problems and they combo pretty well with one nasty treachery card. Also, the other Huorn enemies are pretty nasty too with some pretty bad forced effects. It kind of reminds me of Return to Mirkwood in that if you dont finish in 5 or 6 rounds with heavy questing you could threat out or be in serious trouble.

It is really pretty challenging solo.\n\nSome spoilers ahead.\n\nThe time 2 on the first quest card requires you to quest successfully almost every turn to ensure you can put another time token on the quest card. Usually the first round of questing this is acomplished, but 2nd round with an active location can be difficult to clear and it often requires 8 or more will power to achive, some slow decks that do not have Eowyn and spirit questing power are going to have a challenge with this. If you quest unsuccessfully the 2nd round, you will be down to one time token at the end of the round, and it's likely you will not quest sucessfully third round. At the end of the round when the last time token is removed 2 cards from the encounter deck are revealed. I have not done a through analysis of the threat values of the encounter cards, but it's probably hovering around 3. At this point it's pretty much game over. If you dont quest successfuly on the first round your fate will come sooner. Not only do you have to be able to quest well, you are also going to need to be able to defend high attack enemies that have decent defense and a hefty amount of HP. Also, the unpredictable revealing of Mugash from the out of play deck with engagment of 1 and big time stats will destroy even a good start.\n\nThis is one of the more difficult quests I have seen in a while, Maybe I have not thrown a lot of different decks at it yet, but I would put it on par with Morgul Vale."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=998044","commentId":998044,"userName":"Glowwyrm","timestamp":1393531330,"content":"More spoilers\n\n\n\nI agree, Traker.  It is easily my favorite quest in the box and the one I have played the most.  In two-fisted, the locations pile up quickly and slow you down.  In a couple of games, the treachery that forces you to remove a time counter or damage all exhausted characters (and surges!) came up twice in one quest phase and caused me to choose between losing heroes and failing the quest or letting the timer run out and taking FOUR! more encounter cards.  Needless to say, I lost those games.  I think the search mechanic is great and adds a lot of unpredictability and replayability to the scenario.  When you add more players, you risk the chance of finding one of Mugash's guards, which are really nasty too.  Or, you can flip over Mugash and a guard in one turn, and you'd better be ready for it.  Just a great quest, a solid difficulty, interesting mechanics, and lots of strategic decisions that the player has to make. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=998255","commentId":998255,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1393544433,"content":"As long as we have started to talk about strategy...\n\n \n\nThe Timed mechanic does what it was designed to do: put early pressure on players not to dawdle.  The effect on my deck building - and this is especially true of \"To Catch an Orc\" - is that I now am running a lot of 3 of Uniques where I used to run two.  Examples are Asfaloth and Arwen.  Where I used to run only two of them figuring I would get one sooner or later, now I run three because I want them in my opening hand and in the case of the second quest, I don't want all the copies to be in the orc deck. \n\n \n\nOf course this means having even more cards in my hand that possibly might not do anything, so loot cards and conversion cards are also important.  By this I mean cards like Daeron's Runes and Protector of Lorien.  Throwing away useless cards to Eowyn's ability is obviously good too.\n\n \n\nGreat quests in my opinion and they have really got me streamlining my decks.  Cards that were \"nice to haves\" aren't making the cut in some cases now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=998424","commentId":998424,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1393561029,"content":"Man you guys are all breezing through these quests, I just got Vol yesterday and played the first quest last night.\nLost about 5 times and couldnt play anymore (was getting far too late and was also getting frustrated).\nI did get to the third stage twice though and lost on the second stage the other times.\nThe time counters and whatnot aren't so bad its the enemies themselves..... for a quest that you need to be quick with and quest with lots of willpower to make any progress the enemies are quite difficult with their high armour, high health and even high attack as well........ even the goddamn trackers or scouts or whatever have 3 armour....\n\nMy decks are just too slow and get really strong over time not straight away and this quest more than almost any others (other than obvious ones like SAF, Morgul Vale etc) starts off pretty frantic and can easily overwhelm you within just a few turns.\n\nI find the King's Road and Dunland Chieftain the worst of the lot....

Spoilers ahead!\n\n \n\n \n\nWe played 2-player.  The first and second quests were moderately challenging.  The first was very \"standard\" for recent quests, it's just a flood of enemies, and if you can take control of the staging area you've pretty much got it made.  We beat it with a Bard/Yew Bow deck paired with a Dunhere deck at 22 threat each for a staging area attack strategy.  \n\n \n\nThe second quest gave us the most trouble.  We always play blind the first time, so we went in with our Bard/Dunhere decks and got choked by locations.  Went back to the drawing board, put together a tried and true pair of questing decks and the same thing happened.  That time we were just breaking even during questing, which is enough to ensure you lose the game by round 3.  Then we just went overkill by throwing in Eowyn and Glorfindel (replacing Frodo first, then Bilbo).  Once we got a couple of cards down and survived the first two rounds, the rest was very easy.  Mugash was waaaay at the bottom of my out-of-play deck, but we never felt threatened, it just took a long time to find him.\n\n \n\nThe third quest we won playing blind on our first attempt.  First round travel to Edge of Fangorn, second round clear it and claim Mugash.  Third round finished the first stage and went on to stage 2, then quest to victory on round 4.  Those Huorns were certainly ominous and menacing, but the time bomb never went off and we won very quickly.\n\n \n\nFun quests, To Catch and Orc definitely was my favorite despite early frustration.  But it did harken back to the days of old -- once you get set up, you can really own the board.  It just gets the most points for uniqueness.  The third quest looks like it has potential: when things go wrong, I think they probably go pretty wrong.  It didn't happen to us, so I'm not sure... was very easy on the first attempt."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1000865","commentId":1000865,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1393818768,"content":"Just curious Grandspleen, as per this thread: http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/100324-voi-to-catch-an-orc-stage-2b/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/100324-voi-to-catch-an-orc-stage-2b/]\nWhich rules were you using when you beat the second quest?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1000941","commentId":1000941,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1393828975,"content":"We played that if you quest successfully, you increase the time counter regardless of whether tokens were going to be placed on the quest card.  It definitely made a difference-- I think there was a moment in the early game when we would have had the counter time out.  Once we got set up, though, we owned the board and the counter was a non-issue as long as we could deal with When Revealed or engage effects that give you the choice to decrease it or do something else nasty."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1000944","commentId":1000944,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1393829609,"content":"yeah cool, thats how i've been approaching it too, beating the other way would be insane.\nWell done nonetheless, very hard quest in my opinion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1002548","commentId":1002548,"userName":"rborkowitz","timestamp":1393955820,"content":"Does anybody know why there are shadow effects on some of the cards in the Into Fangorn quest?  Since all the enemies have Hinder and the rules say an enemy with Hinder is not dealt a shadow card, I can't think of any reason why shadow effect text should be included on any of the cards.  Am I missing somethere here?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1002559","commentId":1002559,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1393956296,"content":"> Does anybody know why there are shadow effects on some of the cards in the Into Fangorn quest?  Since all the enemies have Hinder and the rules say an enemy with Hinder is not dealt a shadow card, I can't think of any reason why shadow effect text should be included on any of the cards.  Am I missing somethere here?\n\n \n\nthe encounter set could be used for other quests in the cycle and (i don't have my cards handy to reference) but there is a treachery that makes the trees attack -

I played it over a week before starting with the second one.\n\n \n\nTo catch an Orc is OTOH is boring. The mechanic sounds cool, but in all my games so far I either was brutally beaten because Mugash entered play too early, or they were a walk in the park because he came too late. There never was a challenge.\n\n \n\nThe Dunlandings are a gang of well designed enemies. I love love LOVE how they punish card drawing decks. And they're high threat enemies so you're able to play Hobbit and secrecy decks. The locations also make me sweat, and the treacheries are hard, but not unfair.\n\n \n\nThe story is ok, but I don't like that the heroes basically do all the work for the evil guys.

If it's none to little I would stick with Stargazer, but if you have Glorfindel and Elrond's Counsel it might save you resources to play Deep knowledge.\n\nIs it easy to get the Stargazers in play, or is your spirit hero usuing resources for other cards that makes it a challenge to get them in? If my deck is strong in card draw, and resources are being used fast, a card like stargazer unless it is critical to the deck, might just end up sitting in my hand, since it's not necessary to arrange the cards. If the deck is slow in draw, and I want to make sure I get the cards I need each round then she is a good fit.\n\nStargazer with Beravor can get you 2 cards you want each round. With DK and Beravor, you can pull in 4 new cards.\n\nOutlands decks need to get up and running fast, and then they can handle most things and threat will usually not be an issue. I would suspect that DK fits an Outland build better than stargazer, which may take a few rounds to get into play, and by that point, if you have a good outlands deck, she will be uneccesary because by round 3 or 4 the deck could already be a powerhouse.\n\nBut, without knowing the rest of your deck composition and strategy it's tough to say what the best approach Is. Although any deck that is not playing Aragorn lore with doomed cards is taking a risk."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1015337","commentId":1015337,"userName":"Serazu","timestamp":1395060952,"content":"I'm posting my deck to the strategy thread, since here it's not its place."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1015627","commentId":1015627,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1395075834,"content":"Having finally got the box this weekend, I've been running a couple of decks I have kicking around against the new scenarios (the decks are a quest quietly deck using Frodo, Pippin (lore) and Glorfindel (spirit) that aims to mix high willpower cheap allies with deck manipulation, and a deck using Eowyn, Dunhere and Hama to kill things in the staging area). I lost against both quests the first time out (usually to tactical errors), but then walked them second time out.\n\n \n\nTo Catch An Orc certainly seems to be quite luck based (Mugash came out very late in the game, and got Feinted and whacked), and I was a little sad to see Battle and Siege keywords go, BUT, it was nice to get a new expansion and not immediately have to go build decks just to beat it! I'm excited about how secrecy is becoming viable again, since so few enemies engage at a low-threat, I actually got to play a sneaky deck, and the up-coming cards to help this trait will be mighty welcome.\n\n \n\nThat said, I can totally see power-decks eating these scenarios.

Much as I love Peril in Pelargir, it is a little annoying that some heroes that only offer willpower (obviously Eowyn, but even Sam to a certain extent) are almost useless until the third stage. I thought Blood of Gondor was good with the locations that controlled the type of keyword, and would really like that in future. \n\n \n\nAlso, I agree with Glaurung 100% about the encounter decks getting better with more players. I mostly play two handed, and have found the Fangorn quest to be really quite tricky (although with no deck tweaking to help out - I still had traps in one deck...), and this is largely because the cards can stack against you very quickly. I can see Fangorn being much easier in pure solo (only one card out at the start etc.). A good start to the cycle though! Maybe with the return of Secrecy etc. in the coming packs we'll also see a mix of quest mechanics too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1016798","commentId":1016798,"userName":"Scroll Lock","timestamp":1395162278,"content":"Finally played, won and experimented with each quest solo one-handed (I know you all forgot about this box yet, but here in eastern europe it takes longer to get the newest expansion) and I must say I am not disappointed.\n\nThere are many things I like about VoI- smaller or bigger: Encounter cards are awesome, they bring theme, new interesting mechanics and art is just perfect(Down from the hills, Fords of Isen etc.).

I really like idea if Hourn but most of the time is very easy to past it and win in maximum 3 rounds. But if Mugash will run to the forest (is happen with me once) then the game getting brutal…….. You need to find him, go deep and deep in the the Fangorn and things getting really grim."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1040663","commentId":1040663,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1396844401,"content":"> > Spent the weekend revisiting the box and I still feel the first two adventures are pretty good.  The third is disappoint though.\n> \n> Same here.

But if you try to catch him and fail then it's a problem."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1040719","commentId":1040719,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1396852718,"content":">  \n> \n> > The difficulty for To Catch an Orc depends heavily on the deck you're playing.

Like it has been said already, if you don't quest successfully, you're toast. However,  I plan to try out a mono lore deck with Mirlonde or Pippin in the future. Or I'm going to change my current Hobbit deck (Spirit Pippin / Frodo / Merry) by switching Merry with Grima."}]}
