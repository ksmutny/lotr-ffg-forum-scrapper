I can see their point as the Empire would make a very good faction. However, ALL other SW games have been pvp whether it's minis, cards, or cardboard ships. If the engine is significantly different enough from LOTR, I will be buying this game when it comes out! Lately, I have been having trouble finding friends to play with so the solo option of a coop is perfect for me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50838-another-cooperative-lcg-from-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=507705","commentId":507705,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1312296459,"content":"Wow, consider me blown away by this news.  What a shame that we can't play as the Empire, but ah well.\n\nI'm very curious to see how different (or similar) this will be to LotR, which I immensely enjoy... but a reskin would indeed be pretty lame.  I've never played AGoT, W:I, or CoC, but I hear they're fairly different despite some similarities... in any case, I'll definitely be watching this newly announced release very closely."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50838-another-cooperative-lcg-from-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=507731","commentId":507731,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1312298366,"content":" It seems like all the LCG's have their own special flavor of gameplay, and I'm hoping the Star Wars card game will be no different.  I'm looking forward to hearing more news about this game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50838-another-cooperative-lcg-from-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=507778","commentId":507778,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1312301418,"content":"I was kind of enjoying LOTR being unique as the only co-op LCG.
