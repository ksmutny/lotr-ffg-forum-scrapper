The danger will increase the more locations the players have removed from the game (less locations in the encounter deck but same amount of enemies), so its a build in \"danger timer\".\n\nThe rule about Amon Hen/Lhaw gives the players a tactical choice remove them fast from the game and suffer one more encounter card each quest phase or eat the threat and try to live with it."}]}
