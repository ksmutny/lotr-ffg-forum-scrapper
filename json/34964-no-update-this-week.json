Something went wrong at some point, either with the gameplay, the production schedule, the available personnel to work on it, or whatever. The reasons probably don't really matter in the long run; all that's relevant is that LotR has been pushed to the back of the queue.\n\nMy new prediction is GenCon of 2011 (or August of 2011 for those not familiar with GenCon).
