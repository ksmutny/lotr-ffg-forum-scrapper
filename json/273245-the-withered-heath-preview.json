A few things to go over here. First, Grimbeorn is amazing. Totally reasonable, you can pump him up and he becomes a powerful combat hero, both in solo and multiplayer. I love him. Same for Hidden Way. Excellent card. Both Leadership cards also look totally playable and good. Nothing more to say here.\n\nThe scenario and cycle itself I'm very curious about. So, the cycle seems to be about hunting an ancient cold-drake that threatens Wilderland. That seems about the perfect premise for the Rhovanion cycle. Intuition would tell me he (or she) is gonna the big boss of the cycle, so we will probably kill him in pack 6. That leaves me wondering then what are we exactly gonna do this first pack, named after the Withered Heath, cradle of dragons per excellence in ME. If we're not gonna hunt and kill the boss in the first pack, and only begin our hunt as the article suggests, then I sure as **** hope we're at least gonna see some minor drake enemies in this first pack. I mean, it's called the Withered Heath. It'd be weird if this was only about the beginning of the hunt and we didn't see any drakes in this pack. The presence of a Troll in the cover of the pack worries me. Basically, I'm worried Caleb continues his trend of going to exotic places and not really exploring them. Going to the Withered Heath? Here, fight some trolls. Now obviously this is speculation, but it seems the big dragon we have to kill we're not gonna see till the later packs in the cycle. I hope we have some minor drakes to fight in these early packs.\n\nRegarding the player card themes this cycle, it's clear we're gonna see lots of Dale and Beorning support. To be expected obviously, as these were the last major groups of Free Peoples left to explore (not counting the Lossoth and Woodmen). I only hope we also see some of the stuff I've been advocating for this cycle, namely Istari support (Radagast hero would be a perfect fit for this cycle) and artifact support in the shape of attachments representing actual unique palantiri, and magic rings (remember? This game is called Lord of the Rings and only a few months ago we saw our first generic ring. Are you kidding me?). I hope Caleb actually tackles this big part of the lore which both the MECCG and LOTR TCG explored excellently."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273245-the-withered-heath-preview/?do=findComment&comment=3278894","commentId":3278894,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1523294558,"content":"Such well distributed stats on Grimbeorn :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nGrimbeorn + Captain of Gondor + Armored Destrier + The Day's Rising + Some other restricted attachment + Raven-winged helm\n\nArmored Destrier could be replaced with Raiment of War :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273245-the-withered-heath-preview/?do=findComment&comment=3278921","commentId":3278921,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1523295361,"content":"@Gizlivadi [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/185970-gizlivadi/] but it's a SNOW troll :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\npack looks amazing, possibly a white drake?

For example, Merry's elbows are so wide in the Squire's Helm artwork that if the image were oriented normally, it would have to be shrunk further.
