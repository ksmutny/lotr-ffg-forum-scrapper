If anyone's wondering, the reason I want to have them as player cards is because, even though the boons and treasures are great and thematic, they just feel more like encounter cards than player cards. Having actual player cards of such iconic objects that you can take with you to any quest would be the best. Now regarding spheres, I'd be content to keep them all neutral, but that could easily get out of hand. My suggestion would be Spirit or Lore for Sting, Tactics or Spirit for Orcrist, Leadership for Andúril and I would keep Glamdring neutral like all the other Gandalf attachments. Other objects that need the treatment IMO is the Phial of Galadriel and the Elven rope. I would even like to have a One Ring neutral attachment. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184652-would-you-like-to-get-regular-versions-of-saga-player-cards-some-day/?do=findComment&comment=1728319","commentId":1728319,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1439158646,"content":"If they were kept \"limit one per deck\" they would not have to change much if at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184652-would-you-like-to-get-regular-versions-of-saga-player-cards-some-day/?do=findComment&comment=1728323","commentId":1728323,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1439158914,"content":"I am most eager to get a fully playable version of Sting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184652-would-you-like-to-get-regular-versions-of-saga-player-cards-some-day/?do=findComment&comment=1728370","commentId":1728370,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1439162447,"content":"> If they were kept \"limit one per deck\" they would not have to change much if at all.\n\nDo you mean by rarity?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184652-would-you-like-to-get-regular-versions-of-saga-player-cards-some-day/?do=findComment&comment=1728373","commentId":1728373,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1439162801,"content":"Pretty much.
