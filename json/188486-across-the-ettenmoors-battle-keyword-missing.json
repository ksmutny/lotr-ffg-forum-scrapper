When the rules insert contains information about a particular mechanic then that mechanic will be utilized in the quest. Yet I've looked at the 3 Quest cards and 3 Side Quest cards for the scenario and do not see the Battle keyword on any of them.\n\n \n\nSo I'm wondering - should one of the quest stages or a side quest have the Battle keyword on it? Or am I overlooking something?\n\n \n\nOn a side note, hadn't considered the possibility of Battle/Siege on a Encounter Side Quest. That would be rather annoying."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188486-across-the-ettenmoors-battle-keyword-missing/?do=findComment&comment=1796901","commentId":1796901,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1442339107,"content":"They included Battle in the rules because of the Delay the Enemy player side quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188486-across-the-ettenmoors-battle-keyword-missing/?do=findComment&comment=1796927","commentId":1796927,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1442339894,"content":"Yup, knew I'd missed something.
