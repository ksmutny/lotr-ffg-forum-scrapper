There will obviously need to be much more support than this to make it work but it is a good start, I feel.\n\nFirst off, by having 2 heroes instead of three, you are losing a resource and an action (in the basic terms, of course there is more in fact, like the impossibility of having a 3-sphere right off the start). Then this Strider card (if you draw it, and pay the resource for it) will give you an action back.\n\nNaturally, it shouldn't be hard to create a secrecy deck with only 2 heroes (I am not even considering one right now). On the other hand, for the Strider attachment, you want a hero with at least 2 decent actions, one of them being questing.\n\nIf one is to succeed in such a deck, I am afraid (though I love the card not less for being so strong) Spirit Glorfindel might once again be key. As you can find a very strong hero to create 16 or 17 starting threat line-up, and with Elrond's Counsel probably not having to worry about losing the secrecy discount throughout most of games.\n\nI am certainly looking forward to seeing more such support, as any fresh approach to deck-building is welcomed here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202872-spoiler-for-those-sub-3-hero-decks/?do=findComment&comment=2057277","commentId":2057277,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1455729158,"content":"But Glorfindel already has LoV."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202872-spoiler-for-those-sub-3-hero-decks/?do=findComment&comment=2057280","commentId":2057280,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1455729236,"content":"For some reason, this card looks like a custom made one to me. perhaps the square corners.\n\n \n\nIs this from the upcoming saga set?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202872-spoiler-for-those-sub-3-hero-decks/?do=findComment&comment=2057285","commentId":2057285,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1455729296,"content":"> For some reason, this card looks like a custom made one to me. perhaps the square corners.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Is this from the upcoming saga set?\n\n \n\nNo, it's apparently in The Drowned Ruins (the 4th pack).

Though with any global boosting effect you want to get maximum value by fielding as many allies as possible. So restricting yourself to 5 characters wouldn't be playing to Dains strength. That said, any of those heroes, such as Thorin, that key off having 5 dwarves could be viable. The main issue I forsee here is that a lot of dwarf cards are designed specifically with a large ally count in mind. Cards like Erebor battle master and legacy of Durin. \n\n \n\nI really like how this card supports 2 heroes but not necessarily secrecy.

If FFG wanted they could have made it possible to Gandalf's staff to anyone (for example). If you want to Play thematic you can do that and all who want to go more of a fanfiction route can do that, too (obvious you can houserule, but it's alyways pleasanter to follow the offical rules I would say)\n\nBUT, if they did, the Card would have to be designed completly different, the way it is at the moment, it would be way to strong if every hero (or even every hero of a more common type, like noble) could use it.\n\nLimiting some attachments to a specific hero, is a way to balance a card and in a co-op game, you don't have to feel bad for not using this or that as you can win pretty much any quest without the NEED for a specific hero.\n\nBut FFG Chose the other Option and I'm fine with it.\n\n \n\nNext, it's not like every hero get's his own cards. Heroes that have Cards that work only with them are the \"big stars\" of the books. Gandalf and Aragorn are so well known characters, I would say most, who got them, will play at least one game with them, if there is a new toy for them. You don't really get a dead Card. And I doubt, that we will ever see \"Mirlonde's big great branch\".\n\n \n\nFinally, I feel Strider should have been the title of a Aragorn specific card. Only argument you could make in my opinion is, that the People of Bree don't know who Strider is and therefore it could be any \"Hero\".\n\nThe effect itself is awesome, but it could have any (\"generic\") title and leave \"Strider\" for Aragorn. You could have made such a cool attachment out of \"Strider\" where you put it literally on Aragorn and \"replace\" your Aragorn hero with Strider (what would solve the Problem of having Aragorn and Strider in Play at the same time!)\n\n \n\nAnyway I am really hyped for this card, as I find it as inspiring for deckbuilding as Erestor :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202872-spoiler-for-those-sub-3-hero-decks/?do=findComment&comment=2060108","commentId":2060108,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1455834237,"content":"> > That's the beauty of this game as I see it.

don't mind name-linked attachments as long as they are still useful without the named hero, and I don't mind attachments that are particularly suited to a particular hero, as long as they aren't restricted to that particular hero.  To give some concrete examples:\n\n \n\nLight of Valinor -- while it negates SpGlorfindel's one drawback, it's an amazing attachment on any well-rounded Noldor or Silvan or Elf-friend (excepting Galadriel).\n\n \n\nHerugrim and Snowmane -- while both have Theoden's name right on it and are well-suited to him, it'd be amazing on Eowyn as well, or any high-WP Rohan hero (or high-WP hero with Nor am I a Stranger on it).  Theoden just gets Herugrim one cheaper, and Snowmane's not restricted.  I like.\n\n \n\nSpear of the Mark -- +1 attack, +2 in the staging area, restricted to Rohan.  Although this attachment is just made for Dunhere, it isn't restricted to him and isn't even restricted to Heroes.  Any future cards that would allow a Rohan character to sometimes attack staging would profit from this existing attachment, and vice versa.\n\n \n\nCelebrian's Stone -- +2 willpower for any hero, spirit resource for Aragorn.  While it has an extra minor power for Aragorn, it's generally useful (though takes a restricted spot and costs 2) for any hero.  Like Theoden's toys, I like the useful-plus approach.\n\n \n\nSword that was Broken -- +1 willpower boost for everyone with Aragorn, but leadership resource for 3 on anyone.  Would never, ever be played on anyone but Aragorn, so might as well say \"attach to Aragorn\".  In this case the broadening usage is fake, because the general effect is way, way too expensive.  I'd prefer that it was +1 willpower boost for any Dunedain hero, but grants a leadership icon if on Aragorn.\n\n \n\nAsfaloth -- places one progress, two progress if on Glorfindel.  In theory this is useful-plus, but the plus here doubles the utility of the attachment and ends up making the horse an auto-include on Glorfindel and ignored for any of the others who could have it.    What would've been better here is the Snowmane approach -- two progress for everyone, but a \"Restricted\" tag for all but Glorfindel.\n\n \n\nI don't much care for cards that are explicitly linked to other cards, but my favorite cards are new cards that make older, less-popular cards more useful -- by adding one card to the card pool it can increase the effective card pool by more than one.  In the case of under-used heroes, I think a special effort should be made to release cards that are generally useful, but *particularly* useful to

 Action: Discard a card and exhaust Bilbo's Pipe to reduce threat by one (two if on Bilbo).\n\n \n\nThis would be generally useful for Hobbit secrecy decks, which don't often have Bilbo, but with Hero Bilbo you could have a deck that has threat actively declining without reducing effective hand size, useful for all sorts of shenanigans.  It's unfortunate that the designated pipe fetcher is Bilbo

Thing like that would be pretty cool in a digital game maybe. Not in the cardboard physical one.\n\nThis thread just exploded. John, I can see you are a fighter, but your strong conviction does not invest your argument with persuading power. Basically what you say just doesn't make sense. If I like tactics does that mean that I selfishly want to punish all the people who have no interest in tactics by taking up precious expansion space?\n\nNo. All cards have restrictions. Cost is a restriction, color, copies per deck. Being unique is a restriction. The reason that restrictions are included is so that more powerful and interesting effects can be included without breaking the game. If every card could be used everytime then people would just choose the 16 or so best cards and put 3 copies in their deck and go with it. Then all those other cards that don't make the top 16 would be basically unplayable cardboard, a waste of money. By putting restrictions on cards the decks have to focus on synergies to overcome the restrictions. They have to use the best red cards (for example) or use other colors in combination with color fixers.\n\nIf restrictions are valid as a species, the name specific restrictions are just one member of that species, and are also valid. Tell me how you have made any argument against name specific attachments only?\n\nDon't get me wrong. People can have their opinion. If you don't like name specific attachments, then fine. That is a personal preference, but there is nothing about them that is fundamentally different then any other restriction. If you are against them on principle then consistency would require you to be opposed to all restrictions, which is dumb.\n\nProbably my favorite example of how a name specific attament makes the game better is A Sword that was Broken on Lore Aragorn. Lore Aragorn is one of the best heroes in the game, but it takes a bit to figure it out. One of the reasons he is so powerful is because of StwB. It a lows him to pay for leadership and boosts all wp. It is a difficult card to get and play. You need 3 purple. It is unique, so you often only want 1 copy in your deck (or you draw dead cards). The restrictions and cost are what make the card good (as in fun, good for the game).\n\nSo the fact that I really like that card means I selfishly deprive all people who don't want to play with Aragorn a precious card slot? It doesn't make sense."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202872-spoiler-for-those-sub-3-hero-decks/?do=findComment&comment=2060199","commentId":2060199,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1455837759,"content":"Welp, I just stopped reading right after you said that my argument has no sense.

So the +2 willpower replaces a questing hero considering the average (sort of) is around 2 willpower for heroes. The not exhausting to quest replaces a defensive or offensive action you would have from that other hero. \n\nSo really it is like you sort of are running a third hero with 2 willpower and the same defense or attack as the character with Strider attached. What's more because you get that bonus willpower but still have a defensive or offensive action on top of that it is like you are getting two uses out of a third hero as well.... this is bananas.\n\n \n\nYou can essentially perform more hero actions with two heroes than you could with 3 with this attachment out.....\n\nYes you no longer have a third hero to put undefended damage or archery damage on, yes you have one less hero generating resources (resourceful quickly fixes this however), yes you will have one less sphere match you can make with your heroes (as in you can only have dual sphere or mono sphere with two heroes and not tri sphere, this is obviously not taking into account songs etc) and finally you will have one less unique hero ability BUT you will have FAR LOWER starting threat, access to all secrecy cards for a few rounds (unless you are using two power heroes and so don't have 20 or less starting threat) and in the long run could actually have a far more powerful deck this way.\n\n \n\nJust imagine Glorfindel and Elrond. First turn you play resourceful and Strider on Elrond. You have a total of 8 willpower (the same as if you had a third hero with 2 will) during the first turn and only Glorfindel exhausts to quest. Second turn onwards Elrond is generating 2 resources so is generating that lost resource from a third hero. You can play leaf brooch and Lov on the second turn and still have a resource left or you could even get a second copy of resourceful out. If you play leaf brooch you could play something like test of will for free during that turn. Light of Valinor will allow BOTH your heroes to quest without exhausting and you will now have four actions split between two heroes.\n\nThis obviously takes a few turns to set up and the start of the game is usually the hardest but so long as you can get this set up by the third turn you have the potential to have two heroes that consistently quest without exhausting giving you 4 actions between 2 heroes, 3 to 4 (or max of 5 if you somehow draw all 3 copies of resourceful) resources generated per turn, one hero gets +2 willpower and you can play secrecy cards... this can snowball and with some card draw you could easily smash through your deck quite quickly. \n\n \n\nI think that as a solo deck a two hero deck may struggle a little but playing two handed or two player you can have the second deck hold the fort for the first few turns and then the drawback is even further negated and the two hero deck will be given the support and time it needs to take off and dominate. More cards supporting this strategy will obviously only strengthen it but honestly I think a two hero deck could be run right now with the addition of Strider and would be quite powerful.\n\nLeadership Aragorn and Sam could play first turn steward into strider and resourceful or even into strider and sneak attack gandalf. Bomb an enemy or drop threat by 5 to stay in secrecy longer. Gives you breathing space to set up even more so...\n\n \n\nHeaps of possibilities with this card and I am only scratching the surface. \n\nEdited February 19, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202872-spoiler-for-those-sub-3-hero-decks/?do=findComment&comment=2060645","commentId":2060645,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1455864019,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > That's the beauty of this game as I see it.

Dead means it physically cannot be used unless very specific circumstances, with or without your strongest desire. Let's take two complete opposites: Unexpected Courage and Mirror of Galadriel. UC attaches to a card type(hero), Mirror attaches to a single name. UC can be run in literally any deck that has spirit to pay for it one way or another, it's up to player to choose whether to include it or not. That card is alive. Now let's take the Mirror. You can only play it on two instances of a character - on a Galadriel hero, or a Galadriel ally from leadship that only enters play for one turn. If you are not running Galadriel - you're instantly stripped of the ability to play that card. You're not allowed to do it. Because you don't have that exact hero. Out of 17 from it's sphere, and out of 72 heroes out of the entire game. Want a less open example than UC? Light of Valinor. 15 candidates to choose from, most are even decent. You have a clear and distinct choice to make.\n\n \n\nWhy even bring Fellowship here? They're no more than improved objectives for LotR Saga.\n\n \n\n \n\nDukeWellington, yup.

Do you feel the difference?\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nBut in fact, of the non-saga attachments that name a specific individual, there are only two where the named individual has only a single hero card and no ally -- Bill the Pony (free with Sam Gamgee) and Firefoot (+2 attack with Eomer).  And we know a Sam ally is coming.\n\n \n\nIn practice, there are two heroes that have attachments that can only go on them, have only one hero version, and have an ally version that self-discards, making it an unlikely target.  Those two are Elrond (Vilya), and Galadriel (Nenya, mirror).\n\n \n\nSo how does that affect the effective card pool?  At BGG I posted a series of analysis on 100 decks submitted by different people, and both Elrond and Galadriel were used in 13 of those decks.  There were 49 decks with Lore heroes using cards from Dwarrowdelf and beyond, so Elrond was in 27% of the possible decks, a far cry from 1.38%.  There were 36 decks with Spirit heroes using cards from Ringmaker and beyond, so Galadriel was in 36% of the possible decks for her.\n\n \n\nBut what about their toys?  Vilya was in 10 decks, Nenya in 11, and the Mirror in 5.  As a percentage of Elrond/Galadriel decks the percentages are high (77%, 85%, 45%), but Vilya was in 20% of the Lore decks, Nenya was in 31% of the Spirit decks, and Mirror of Galadriel was in 14% of the Spirit decks.\n\n \n\nSo how does the usage compare to unrestricted attachments not associated with any particular trait?  In Lore decks I identified eleven such attachments, only three of which boasted a higher percentage of usage (Burning Brand, The Long Defeat, and Protector of Lorien).  In Spirit decks I also identified eleven such attachments, with only one (Unexpected Courage) with a higher percentage of usage than Nenya, and another four ahead of the mirror (Ancient Mathom, Silver Harp, Miruvor and Favor of the Lady -- with Silver Harp essentially being a Noldor attachment).\n\n \n\nSo even those most specific of attachments are seeing considerable use in the current pool, being much *better* used than the average card.  Now the problem of course is that the popular by-name attachments are of course associated with popular heroes.  That's why I'd like to see cards particular useful for less popular heroes, though not (of course) restricted only to that hero.  Dori needs help, but a card that can only be played on Dori could well join him in the coaster pile.\n\n \n\nHow does the usage compare to the Warrior attachments?  Excluding saga boons, there's a grand total of one attachment requiring the \"Warrior\" trait, the captain of Gondor.  This could've been used in 24 decks and was actually used in seven of them, a 29% rate for the possible decks, and if we expand to all Ringmaker tactics decks it still has a 20% usage rate, the same as Vilya, less than Nenya, and more than Mirror of Galadriel.  While the Warrior attachment is more flexible, it's not actually more popular.\n\n \n\nMeanwhile, some other generically-traited hero attachments got very little love.  For example, the two Noble-related attachments weren't used at all, Heir of Mardil being left out of all 20 possible decks and Palantir being left out of all 61 possible decks.\n\n \n\nUltimately, it's not about the number of decks a card *could* be in, it's about the number of decks a card *would* be in.  A high percentage isn't necessarily the sign of a good card, of course.  If 3x Test of Will has to be in every Spirit deck, that reduces the amount of deck space available for everything else.  If you're doing a Gandalf-Elrond-Galadriel deck and stock it with all their toys, that's going to consume a significant portion of the deck.  One thing the powerful-but-restricted-by-name cards actually do positively is keep these powerful cards from being auto-includes in a wide range of decks.  If you could attach Vilya to anyone, it'd be in more than 10 decks.  If you could attach Nenya to any Noldor, it'd make a ridiculous combo with Light of Valinor.  Trait restrictions, trait enhancements, and the spheres themselves are all ways of *fragmenting* the card pool to avoid generic builds.  It's a feature, not a bug.\n\n \n\nThe real problem, IMO, is the coaster.  Every card that is useful in *some* deck will see play.  But cards that aren't useful won't get played, no matter how many decks they could theoretically be in.  Since the pace that the pool grows is slow and fixed, every coaster released is an opportunity missed, and every new card that grants new life to one or more old cards is a godsend."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202872-spoiler-for-those-sub-3-hero-decks/?do=findComment&comment=2061551","commentId":2061551,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1455904884,"content":"John's error is that he conflate playing a deck with building a deck.

In fact, if I were to be so kind as to restate John basic point in a stronger, more reasonable, form, I would say that the problem with name specific attachments is that the game designers essentially force you to include them in your deck when running the specified hero. With Vilya this is not as big a problem, but with Galadriel and her ring I think it is a valid point. It is similar to the complaint about outlands, the deck building is not an exercise in creativity because once you choose a theme a lot of the deck slots are taken up by must-include cards.\n\nTHAT is a valid point worth talking about.
