If you need the rule sheet because you lost your hard copy or you want to have the digital version then you're out of luck. 2. Not all the 'do not read' sections are blacked out. Even in the Grey Havens pdf itself one section is blacked out, the others are not. 3. Arkham Horror card game pdfs have all the spoiler info readable. I really wish FFG would go back and remove those blacked out sections since there is no point to it but I doubt seriously they will. ><"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243056-2-rules-downloads-not-working-for-the-grey-havens/?do=findComment&comment=2758107","commentId":2758107,"userName":"alboy","timestamp":1493373822,"content":"Both downloads are now working as of today."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243056-2-rules-downloads-not-working-for-the-grey-havens/?do=findComment&comment=2759635","commentId":2759635,"userName":"TalisDiorn","timestamp":1493423963,"content":"> 13 hours ago, alboy said:\n> \n> Both downloads are now working as of today.\n\n \n\nThanks for letting us know!"}]}
