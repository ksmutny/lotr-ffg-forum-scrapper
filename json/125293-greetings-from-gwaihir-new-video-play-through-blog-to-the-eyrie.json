New video play-through blog: To the Eyrie","comments":[{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125293-greetings-from-gwaihir-new-video-play-through-blog-to-the-eyrie/?do=findComment&comment=1306309","commentId":1306309,"userName":"Gwaihir Lord of the Winds","timestamp":1413867095,"content":"For those interested in video play-throughs, check out my new blog: To the Eyrie. Below is an excerpt from my \"about\" page. Hope you enjoy!\n\n \n\nhttp://totheeyrie.wordpress.com [http://totheeyrie.wordpress.com]\n\n \n\nGreetings from Gwaihir, Lord of the Winds!\n\nI am Gwaihir, Lord of the Winds,the greatest and swiftest of the Eagles of Middle-earth. As protector of Elves, Men, and all Free Folk, To the Eyrie is my gift to you, the heroes, who travel far and wide within the wondrous and perilous world imagined by J.R.R. Tolkien and brought to our table tops by Fantasy Flight’s LCG, The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game. As primarily a solo player (my wingspan is too large to accommodate other winged friends, and besides, the other Eagles are still jealous about my tiny crown), this blog will specifically approach The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game from the “solo player perspective,” and thus, it will discuss quest mechanics and deck design accordingly.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, since there already exists excellent blogs and podcasts that discuss the player cards, deck design, and provide encounter set reviews (see: Tales from the Cards [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/], Hall of Beorn [http://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/],  Cardboard of the Rings [http://cardboardoftherings.com/], and The Grey Company [https://greycompanypodcast.wordpress.com/]) the primary purpose of this blog is to provide video solo play-throughs of various quests using the physical cards (there’s nothing like the feel of cardboard between your talons!). While I am Lord of the Winds, I am by no means “Lord of the Game” and so do not presume to be an “expert” when it comes to playing the game. I simply enjoy the game, storyline, and  community that encompasses this LCG (although, like Matthew D.,  I am also “no slave to theme”). Nevertheless, I hope these videos  will appeal to fans of Gwaihir’s favorite game about his favorite books.\n\n \n\nAs you journey the road, may you frequent my eyrie to watch video play-throughs of your favorite quests and gain an “eyrie vision” on how to successfully make your way through various scenarios from the game (including nightmare mode). Until then, may you farewell, wherever you fare, till your eyries receive at the journey’s end!\n\n \n\n \n\nEdited October 21, 2014 by Gwaihir Lord of the Winds"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125293-greetings-from-gwaihir-new-video-play-through-blog-to-the-eyrie/?do=findComment&comment=1306366","commentId":1306366,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1413874712,"content":"Sounds good.

It only says that you can play it \"as if it was in your hand\" which means, just like how you pay for other cards in your hand you can use resources from all three heroes, as long as they match. I am pretty sure it is a valid play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125293-greetings-from-gwaihir-new-video-play-through-blog-to-the-eyrie/?do=findComment&comment=1306387","commentId":1306387,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1413876842,"content":"That crazy powerful deck.
