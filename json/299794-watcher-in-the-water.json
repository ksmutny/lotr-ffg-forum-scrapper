So as soon as the attack begins (i.e. step 1) the top card of the encounter deck should be discarded before step 2 when a defender is declared.\nNote that Thrashing and Grasping Tentacles trigger on being attacked and in step 1 of player attacks both the target and the attackers get declared."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299794-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=3781085","commentId":3781085,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1568052079,"content":"> 58 minutes ago, rees263 said:\n> \n> I disagree with this interpretation.

If that card has a shadow effect or is a Tentacle enemy, this attack is considered undefended.\"\n\nThe Dol Guldur Beastmaster erratum explicitly states that this phrasing triggers at the time of the 1st step of enemy attack resolution, which is indeed before a defender would be declared.\n\nhttp://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Card91 [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Card91]\n\nEdited September 9, 2019 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299794-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=3781150","commentId":3781150,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1568055732,"content":"Now that I think about it, are you even able to declare a defender if the attack is considered undefended?
