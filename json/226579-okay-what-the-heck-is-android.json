It's an odd, baggy game that seems to purport to be a murder mystery but is actually something a great deal more amorphous. Check it out at https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android/]. The creators have previously stated that there really wasn't any great reason for them to come up with such a carefully fleshed-out world for what was originally envisioned as a one-off game, but hey, most people seem to be pretty glad they did.\n\nBringing it back to LotR, I do hope FFG eventually returns to putting out more varied content in the Tolkien universe, as they've recently demonstrated for the Android one. That dice game doesn't really do it for me, but at least they remembered to do something with the IP."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226579-okay-what-the-heck-is-android/?do=findComment&comment=2341324","commentId":2341324,"userName":"Supertoe","timestamp":1470254789,"content":"Its a really cool futuristic setting, that kind of shows us what the world will look like if everything goes the way it is currently going."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226579-okay-what-the-heck-is-android/?do=findComment&comment=2341456","commentId":2341456,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1470260193,"content":"This thread should have been in another subforum :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226579-okay-what-the-heck-is-android/?do=findComment&comment=2341518","commentId":2341518,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1470263508,"content":"Interesting that no one answered \"it's an operative system\"..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226579-okay-what-the-heck-is-android/?do=findComment&comment=2341522","commentId":2341522,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1470263614,"content":"> Interesting that no one answered \"it's an operative system\"...\n\nWe know context here ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226579-okay-what-the-heck-is-android/?do=findComment&comment=2341670","commentId":2341670,"userName":"Tekwych","timestamp":1470272478,"content":"> Interesting that no one answered \"it's an operative system\"...\n\nAs an iUser I'm not sure how 'operative' that software is but some do call it an operating system. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226579-okay-what-the-heck-is-android/?do=findComment&comment=2341965","commentId":2341965,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1470295405,"content":"Cool.
