I just picked up this AP and haven't played it yet, but I would probably stay away from using Glorfindel's ability unless it was a dire need. As a neutral ally, Radagast will be much easier to replace. Also, Radagast can heal more than one wound at a time, which makes it a much better reward for the sacrifice of the card. Save up his resources and then play them at once. Keep in mind Wilyador can only be healed up to 5 wounds at a time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53288-rhosgobel-quest-2b/?do=findComment&comment=529466","commentId":529466,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1316270212,"content":"Or get rid of Rhosgobel during stage 1 (*cough*NT*cough*) and do some healing during it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53288-rhosgobel-quest-2b/?do=findComment&comment=529471","commentId":529471,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1316271282,"content":"Dam said:\n\nOr get rid of Rhosgobel during stage 1 (*cough*NT*cough*) and do some healing during it.\n\n\n\nYeah :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] extremaly hard to pull off succesfully.
