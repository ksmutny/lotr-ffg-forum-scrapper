I'm new to LotR LCG and have questions about two cards from the core set. Can you use Wandering Tooks ability if you are only playing solo one-handed? Lowering your threat would be great but I don know if it's usable since there isn't another player to give Wandering Took too after you use the ability.\n\nFor Snowborn Scout's ability, I assume you can put a progress token on a location even if it's in the staging area and not yet travelled too, correct? If there are enough progress tokens on it while in the staging area does it immediately go to the discard pile or do you still need to travel to the location before you can clear it off the table?\n\nThanks for the help!\n\nMK"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192649-wandering-took-and-snowborn-scout-core-ability-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1875256","commentId":1875256,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1446484455,"content":"No.\n\n \n\nYes. It immediately goes into discard pile from the staging area, and is considered to be explored."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192649-wandering-took-and-snowborn-scout-core-ability-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1875269","commentId":1875269,"userName":"mysticknight232","timestamp":1446484778,"content":"A follow up question about Wandering Took. Assuming you are playing with multiple people and you use the Tooks ability, who's discard pile does it go too if it gets killed? I assume it goes to the person that had Wandering Took in their deck (owner) and not the person that had Wandering Took in front of them on the table, right?\n\nThx again!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192649-wandering-took-and-snowborn-scout-core-ability-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1875281","commentId":1875281,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1446485334,"content":"A discarded player card always goes into the discard pile of whoever is playing the card, because that player controls that card.

If you play Wandering Took (WT) and give him to another player, that player now controls WT, but you still own WT. When a card is discarded, it is placed in the owners discard pile."}]}
