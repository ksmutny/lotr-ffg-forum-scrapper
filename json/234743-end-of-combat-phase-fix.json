One of them has \"Watchful Eyes\" attached, which instructs me to reveal and add an encounter card. I do so and add another \"Wachtful Eyes\" to the staging area. From there it is attached directly to one of my other exhausted heroes.\n\n \n\nThe question is .. do i reveal and add a second encounter card for the second \"Watchful Eyes\" now? Or do i pass the \"end of combat phase\" trigger?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234743-end-of-combat-phase-fix/?do=findComment&comment=2502268","commentId":2502268,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1479219193,"content":"You trigger all \"beginning/end of\" effects at once, then you resolve them in the order you choose.

My thinking would go:\n\n- Some action/framework-action/event happens,\n\n- We then have a window in which conditional passives effect, then Forced effects, then Responses occur.\n\n- During this window, any card that has it's response condition met by circumstances that occurred during this action window are valid to resolve.\n\n \n\nErgo the new card, introduced during the Forced response window of the end-of-round event would have a relevant Forced on it also resolve.\n\n \n\nThat would certainly be the CoC way of doing things."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234743-end-of-combat-phase-fix/?do=findComment&comment=2503403","commentId":2503403,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1479288156,"content":"I originally expected it to work that way too, but received this ruling: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206336-nighttime-in-eriador/#entry2117170 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206336-nighttime-in-eriador/#entry2117170]"}]}
