Your confusion here is because the encounter set 'Dol Guldur Orcs' also contains a specific individual card called 'Dol Guldur Orcs'. It's referring to the whole encounter set though, which is all of these cards: http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?EncounterSet=Dol%20Guldur%20Orcs [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?EncounterSet=Dol%20Guldur%20Orcs]. You'll note they all have the little symbol of an orc's face. Similarly the Passage Through Mirkwood set have the symbol of a little tree, and Spiders of Mirkwood a spider."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194345-rules-help/?do=findComment&comment=1907271","commentId":1907271,"userName":"mark reynolds","timestamp":1448458849,"content":"> Encounter cards are grouped into different sets.
