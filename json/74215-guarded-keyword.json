As it is guarded I drew a second card. The second card I drew was also an Athelas card. Now the rules clearly state \"If another objective card comes up while attaching a card for the guarded keyword, place the second objective in the staging area, and use the next card of the encounter deck to fulfill the original keyword effect.\"\n\nDoes that mean I draw another card to guard the first Athelas card and then a second card to guard the second Athelas card?\n\nI believe this is right (and this is where you will tell me otherwise), but I can't seem to see a FAQ response or another query on this. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nLee"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74215-guarded-keyword/?do=findComment&comment=722587","commentId":722587,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1352788885,"content":"yes, both need to be guarded by drawing cards\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74215-guarded-keyword/?do=findComment&comment=722591","commentId":722591,"userName":"Chaos101","timestamp":1352789455,"content":"As ever, Rich -Â very helpful!
