I don't think the card is ever in play, as it is discarded right away. However, I think you still have to add the 2 points threat, as it doesn't matter if the card is in play or not. But that's an educated guess, would be nice if someone else could tell if cards in the discard pile (or cards that are not in play in general) are affected by card effects."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92095-special-cards-are-in-play/?do=findComment&comment=889749","commentId":889749,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1381911760,"content":"Text are only in effect when the cards is in play or if the text specifically mention otherwise.\n\nCards with a X threat should count as 0 because the X is defined in the card text."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92095-special-cards-are-in-play/?do=findComment&comment=889765","commentId":889765,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1381916755,"content":"> Text are only in effect when the cards is in play or if the text specifically mention otherwise.\n> \n> Cards with a X threat should count as 0 because the X is defined in the card text.\n\nYou're right.\n\n \n\nFor everyone who is interested, it's in the rulebook on p. 23 under \"constant effects\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92095-special-cards-are-in-play/?do=findComment&comment=889788","commentId":889788,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1381922026,"content":"But..., if shadow cards are considered not in play..., these cards can be \"discarded\" from play?
