If this is the case this could potentially be one of the most powerful boons in the campaign thus far.\n\nYou could use it first turn for an extra two cards for one player and an extra two resources for the other (two handed) in pretty much every game so long as the player with it in hand has the ring bearer. Even second turn it is incredibly strong. \n\nFor solo play it is even more bonkers, you will be able to play it first turn no matter what as you will always control the ring bearer and you will obviously choose yourself as the target for both effects. You could even make a hero lineup that normally does not put you in secrecy and then use Brace of Coneys at the start of every game to put yourself INTO secrecy. \n\n \n\nOther boons we have had so far have had similar powerful effects but are removed from the campaign pool afterwards. The fact we can use this boon time and time again (I guess when you think about it there are only 6 quests left after this box though, plus any POD quests we get that can be added to saga mode) is a pretty big deal. \n\nIt is kind of bugging me that the potentially best boon card we have seen thus far is a couple of dead rabbits  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183492-a-heavy-burden-boons-and-burdens-preview-for-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1707795","commentId":1707795,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1438143652,"content":"You probably have to shuffle it into your deck, making it much less consistent."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183492-a-heavy-burden-boons-and-burdens-preview-for-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1707797","commentId":1707797,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1438144358,"content":"ah of course!
