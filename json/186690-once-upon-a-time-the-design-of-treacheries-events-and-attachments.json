When they make this kind of stock images they don't actually put physical cards and take a picture, but rather use the digital image of the cards and make them look like they're displayed on a table with Photoshop. With that said, I don't think they were supposed to be designed sideways but just digitally displayed sideways like the Goblin Sniper and Necromancer's Path, and due to the effect of foreshortening they sorta look like they are horizontally designed. But if this was the case, they would have the same length as the player card facedown right next to it, and it's clearly shorter. That means that the cards were not designed to be horizontal.\n\nEdited August 30, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186690-once-upon-a-time-the-design-of-treacheries-events-and-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=1764408","commentId":1764408,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1440979212,"content":"This image explains it better.
