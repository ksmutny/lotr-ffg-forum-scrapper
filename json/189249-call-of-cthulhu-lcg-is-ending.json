With Saga Expansions and Deluxe Expansions planned into the future, there is every reason to believe that The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game will continue for many more years. Still, a sad day for fans of the CoC LCG.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189249-call-of-cthulhu-lcg-is-ending/?do=findComment&comment=1813160","commentId":1813160,"userName":"mulletcheese","timestamp":1442959031,"content":"As a CoC player I can confirm...

Both in visual design and basic mechanics. Though I guess the creator/s will do that as this fan-made game is developed. Is there a BGG thread, or a forum thread here, where this is maintained and updated?\n\nEdited September 23, 2015 by narubianHorror293"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189249-call-of-cthulhu-lcg-is-ending/?do=findComment&comment=1814448","commentId":1814448,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1443018635,"content":"Well, I would say it's pretty different.
