I'll be using these boxes here [http://www.basicallywooden.co.uk/our-collections/card-game-boxes/]; the birtch wood should be sturdy enough not to deform under the weight of the cards (after all they were designed specifically for these games, and at the moment I found only positive reviews), and in any case there's room for 3300 unsleeved cards, so, I think 2K sleeved or so, so, I'll be in need for at least 3 of these dudes here.\n\n \n\nI got lucky with some unexpected money coming from an external job, and ordered the first box yesterday (yes, with the One Ring writings engraved on the top lid). If there's interest from the community, I'll post a couple of pictures of it once I stored the first chunk of the collection in it)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/239228-the-physical-dimensions-of-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=2583754","commentId":2583754,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1484162821,"content":"That is a lovely box."}]}
