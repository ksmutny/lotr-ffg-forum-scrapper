We thought about adding the whole Grottodeck into the victory display will ruin the scenario.\n\nIs it possible to add a Grotto-location via Leave no Trace Â in the victory display? If yes, does this count as having an underwater location in the victory display?\n\nAdding the two normal Underwater locations via Leave no Trace in the victory display makes this scenario much easier."}]}
