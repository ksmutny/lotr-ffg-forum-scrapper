I was too expecting him to be Leadership but since this is the last cycle I guess they had nowhere else to put Gildor in. Lore still makes sense for Saruman but the decision to make him Lore feels more like a constriction.\n\nEdited December 9, 2019 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303201-why-isnt-saruman-a-leadership-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3845652","commentId":3845652,"userName":"pmdoug","timestamp":1575920145,"content":"I agree that Leadership would have been a fitting sphere for him, but Lore still works quite well thematically.

And the more items the better for Saruman, as he clearly was a bit of a hoarder: there's that interesting bit in Unfinished Tales where Aragorn and Gimli uncover the Elendilmir, Isildur's chain, Eorl's jewels, etc. all squirreled away in Orthanc.

It could represent Saruman the White before his corruption and decline, but even then Lore and Leadership are far more appropriate. There's no hard and fast rule about what makes for a Spirit hero, but Saruman's vibe seems so at odds with the what makes the sphere distinct.  I'm all for expanding the spheres beyond their original clear cut roles, but I do think some characters can be thematically miscast. \n\nThat all being said, I'd still love to see a pitch for Spirit Saruman. I'd play that card, even if it left me scratching my head. \n\n \n\nEdited December 11, 2019 by pmdoug"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303201-why-isnt-saruman-a-leadership-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3846595","commentId":3846595,"userName":"Felswrath","timestamp":1576034322,"content":"> 4 hours ago, RogueSeventeen said:\n> \n> You have all helped me understand, thank you.  I have changed my position.\n> \n> There is an unspoiled Lore card in the Wainriders set, so possibly a guarded Palantir of Orthanc?  I'm assuming Ulfast has an unspoiled guarded spirit weapon that gives +2 attack and a Response that lowers threat by 1 when you destroy an enemy, so a guarded lore item in the next set would make sense.\n\nThe other lore card is an ally. It costs two resources and has a 2,2,2,2 stat line. With these stats, the card is going to have to have a negative effect in order to avoid an insane level of power creep. I suspect it will be some sort of Isengard guard with the Doomed x keyword.

Threat seems to mainly represent the attention you are bringing to yourselves. Sounding  a horn is likely not going to help you sneak around, but it will alert your allies to your need... and possibly some enemies as well!"}]}
