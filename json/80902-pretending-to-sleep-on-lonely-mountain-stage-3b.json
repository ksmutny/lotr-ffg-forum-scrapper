From para 1.15 in the FAQ:\n\n'If a card effect uses the word \"then\", then the preceding effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent dependent effect to resolve.'\n\nAs Smaug the Golden is out of play, you can't place the progress on him so therefore the preceding effect doesn't resolve and you can ignore the text after 'Then'. The Surge still happens though. Hope this helps!"}]}
