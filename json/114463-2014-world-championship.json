From begin designers plan to make tournament but with a time they understood it will be to difficult. Now they come with idea of this specula event. Wny not? But i participate  one tournament in Paris 6 months ago and i believe there is system to make kind of special organise play for this game. Will see how FFG will make this even in Oktober. "}]}
