Its not surprising though as they must be so busy with all the releases they have got on at the moment. Oh well at least it is something to look forward to after the big fat jolly man from the the North Pole arrives next month."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73616-hobbit-2-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=717851","commentId":717851,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1351784922,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nNarsil0420 said:\n\n \n\nI just noticed that they updated the release estimate for the Second Hobbit expansion to Q1 2013 from Q4 2012.
