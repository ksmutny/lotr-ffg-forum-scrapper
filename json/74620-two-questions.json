Or even if they are \"doable\" at the same time and in that case if the first playre decides which to resolve first.\n\n \n\nIf this was the case then Eomund's response would be great… But, as i said, i'm in doubt about this one…\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIf it is, then you could have all rohan characters that survive the Sleeping Sentry effect ready…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74620-two-questions/?do=findComment&comment=726693","commentId":726693,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1353570193,"content":"muemakan said:\n\nShadow cards only count as shadow card. \n\n \n\nEomund could trigger but who would he ready……all other exhausted characters did die along with him.\n\n\n\n \n\noh, never mind my post……..I was thinking of SS shadow effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74620-two-questions/?do=findComment&comment=726953","commentId":726953,"userName":"pcjames","timestamp":1353630420,"content":" thank you all guyshappy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"}]}
