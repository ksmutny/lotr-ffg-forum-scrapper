I am playing Druadan Forest and after setup I flipped the quest card and reveal an enemy with prowl.\n\n \n\nSo I am not sure: Do I flip Quest card 1A during Setup or at the beginning of my first resource phase?\nI think the game begins once the quest is flipped and the heroes did not collect any resources yet. Is that correct?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96694-setup-question/?do=findComment&comment=952451","commentId":952451,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1389538150,"content":"Setup is before resource phase. Thus, if in 1a force to reveal cards from encounter deck and one of these cards force to you to remove 1 resource token, it is not bad, because you dont have resources still.\n\nNormally, you begin the resource phase in 1b quest card. In setup you resolve 1a text and pass to 1b and resolve his text also, if able."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96694-setup-question/?do=findComment&comment=952455","commentId":952455,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1389538894,"content":"Hi\n\nThanks for the quick response.

After these steps are completed then the resource phase starts. So you do not have any resources when stage 1b is revealed. If you have a character like Eleanor you can use her response before the setup is complete though, although she will remain tapped until the end of the first round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96694-setup-question/?do=findComment&comment=952550","commentId":952550,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1389551404,"content":"Thank you, Tracker1.
