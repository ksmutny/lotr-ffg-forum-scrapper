(and It is picking up really). We now get sagas, deluxe expansions, cycles and POD (nightmare and one unique hard quest a year).\n\nWhen the game first started it took 18 months or something to get the first cycle completed - and none of the other content came out. Long stretches of no news took it's toll previously so we now get regular updates - however at some points in the year those updates have to reveal content we won't get for a while. \n\nI think this game is harder to manage than the other LCG's because it's not really multiplayer (you can play with people - but you don't play against them). Most of the life of the other games comes from new opponents, but there's a lot less variability in the deck building and once you've beaten the quests...\n\nThat said I don't get to play that often so really, I'm lagging behind on quest completion. I haven't touched VoL yet. Maybe If I'd played it all and built all the decks I wanted I'd be irritated by the previews. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104275-seems-like-forever-since-voi-was-released-when-is-this-cycle-going-to-get-started/?do=findComment&comment=1055319","commentId":1055319,"userName":"7theye","timestamp":1397960002,"content":"The problem with this game is replay value.\n\nWhen it's a competitive game people can use the same card pool for years playing against friends.\n\nWhen it's co-op you play against a encounter set.

I also do not mind winning a majority of the games just as long as they are no walk in the park.\n\n \n\nNow to the points, the marketing of this game is poor. We so often get previews of a pack long in advance and then nothing prior to the release. It is like having a trailer to a movie six month before, and then none in the last six weeks before the premiere.\n\n \n\nDoomed decks suck for me. I hardly expected that. I still like Deep Knowledge but outside of that, these do not seem nearly as powerful, or fun, as I anticipated.\n\n \n\nAnd yes, teasing us with new deck archetypes, like the wonderful-looking Silvan decks, and then having us wait half a year for them, that is cruelty."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104275-seems-like-forever-since-voi-was-released-when-is-this-cycle-going-to-get-started/?do=findComment&comment=1055592","commentId":1055592,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1398003631,"content":">  \n> \n> When the game first started it took 18 months or something to get the first cycle completed - and none of the other content came out.\n> \n>  \n\nNo. The game was released in April 2011 and the Shadow of Mirkwood cycle ended before the end of the year, with Khazad-dum not that far away.
