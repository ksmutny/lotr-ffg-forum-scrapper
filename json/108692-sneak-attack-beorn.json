I'm assiming that because you use Beorn's ability after sneak attack it resolves and shuffles him back into your library rather than back into your hand. The couple of times I've sneak attacked him and then used his ability this is how I've played. Just wanted to see if there was a ruling for this though =)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108692-sneak-attack-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=1121453","commentId":1121453,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1402804092,"content":"It's in the FAQ under \"simultaneous effect timing,\" and they use Beorn + Sneak Attack as an example:\n\n \n\n(1.02) Simultaneous Effect Timing\nIf two or more conflicting effects would occur\nsimultaneously, the first player decides the order in\nwhich the effects resolve.\nExample: Tom plays Sneak Attack (CORE 23) to\nput Beorn (CORE 31) into play during the combat\nphase. Sneak Effect has the condition, “At the end of\nthe phase, if that ally is still in play, return it to your\nhand.” During combat, Tom uses Beorn’s triggered\neffect, which has the condition, “At the end of the\nphase in which you trigger this effect, shuffle Beorn\nback into your deck.” At the end of the phase, a\nsituation arises in which two conflicting effects are\nattempting to resolve simultaneously on Beorn. The\nfirst player determines which of the two effects resolves\nfirst. (The second effect no longer applies when Beorn\nleaves play.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108692-sneak-attack-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=1121492","commentId":1121492,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1402808584,"content":"Wow..\n\nThats pretty crazy that you can choose, don't get me wrong it makes sense but just makes sneak attack + beorn very powerful.\n\nThanks Grandspleen!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108692-sneak-attack-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=1121686","commentId":1121686,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1402840068,"content":"no more that sneak + gandaf.

FAQ is not totally 100% clear.\n\nMy doubt returns to start from the discuss about Staff Gandalf + cancel shadow effects with +X attack enemy. The effect of shadow card continues even if it is discarded. So the effect of Beorn is still open despite he would return to hand by sneak-attack effect.\n\nIf you chose Beorn effect first:\n\n-1- Beorn goes to deck\n\n-2- Sneak attacks has no effect because Beorn is not in game\n\nIf you chose SA first:\n\n-1- Beorn goes to hand by SA effect\n\n-2- Beorn goes to discard by his own effect\n\n \n\nDo i miss something, then?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108692-sneak-attack-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=1733572","commentId":1733572,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1439419047,"content":"The case with shadow cards is that they're like events - it doesn't matter where the card is, because once you turn it over it resolves, changing the game state in some way. Discarding it makes no difference because the effect has already happened.\n\nBy contrast, Beorn is not an event, he's an ally, and his text is only active while he's in play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108692-sneak-attack-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=1734095","commentId":1734095,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1439460290,"content":"Sure?
