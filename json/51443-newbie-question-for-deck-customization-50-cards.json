Right now the card pool is small. Will probably take this entire Mirkwood set of Adventure Packs to come out before each sphere has enough variety, at least.\n\nIf you can get your hands on the two Adventure Packs released so far, they come with Song cards that add a specific sphere to hero cards when attached. Using those you can go 3 and even 4 sphere in your decks. It's ugly and can rely more on the luck of the draw that way but it can work.\n\nFor now don't be afraid to go less than 50. It can actually help you draw the stuff that'll work instead of having all of that situational filler.\n\nOr you could burn through that disposable income and buy multiple Core Sets to have 3 of each card. Some of us can't bring ourselves to do that right now.

Might be a typo in the code somewhere that causes a discrepancy between how the game is listed in the drop down game listing and how it's spelled in the code. It's always the little things."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51443-newbie-question-for-deck-customization-50-cards/?do=findComment&comment=513749","commentId":513749,"userName":"OjoDelPensador","timestamp":1313166185,"content":" Thanks, all, that all makes sense... and now that I *look* for \"The\" LOTR:TCG in the menu, I'm able to narrow my search.  Silly me!  :-P\n\nA friend and I just played the Passage Through Anduin scenario.  Thought we were going to get smacked, but it proved much easier in the end than we expected.  I expect our final score was not very noteworthy (80) as we both had a serious level of threat by the end.  I had only worked through about 15 cards in my deck.  Is that typical?  Sure makes the 50 card deck minimum really lower percentages of getting useful cards.\n\nRegards,\n\nBruce"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51443-newbie-question-for-deck-customization-50-cards/?do=findComment&comment=513955","commentId":513955,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1313214718,"content":"Good Luck!\n\nAs for now, each sphere has 19 cards available, plus 3 neutral ones.
