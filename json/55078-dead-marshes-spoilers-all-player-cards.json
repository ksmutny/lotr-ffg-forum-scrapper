However I will agree with you about his posting habits. Especially when he does not post his \"masterpiece\" decks to help other players along. The reason a lvl 1 deck is lvl 1 is because you can take practically ANY deck and win with it, while as you go up the scale you need more tuned/specific decks to win. lvl 4 decks tend to need 2 sphere decks with spirit, which most people play already. lvl 7+ tends to need multiple players to win as it stands now.\n\nNow if Glarrung would create a thread and post his \"obvious\" championship decks with instructions how to play them with each scenario I am sure we would all appreciate that as we just love to play the game.\n\n \n\nBack to topic...Thanks for the post!  I am really excited for this one now. I am of like thoughts with most of the posters who have already responded."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55078-dead-marshes-spoilers-all-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=545678","commentId":545678,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1319252664,"content":"Difficulty 5 does not mean anything.  For my most succesful deck, carrock 7 is easier than anduin 4. Gollum 4 is soo easy that maybe Mirkwood 1 is slightly harder. Osgiliath is easier than 6 rhosgobel and dol guldur 7.\n\nIf I win against Osgiliath, Rhosgobel, Dol Guldur I do not shout \"I am awesome, give me harder quests. Oh no 5 is too low, I already beat higher numbers\"\n\n \n\nGlaurung, a simple idea for you. When you play for example Carrock quest, change encounter sets you use. So instead of Anduin set, use Dol Guldur orcs.\n\nOr, starting from 3rd turn or 2nd turn draw every time an additional card for the enemy.\n\nOr try to create 1 deck that is capable of winning ALL scenarios with win rate 80% or more. And I mean ALL scenarios, including Rhosgobel and Dol Guldur. For sure, when you try to customize your deck to beat Rhosgobel, the deck will suddenly become weaker against other quests. Also, do not play the quest once or twice with the deck and say \"I win all the time\", but instead play like 20 games against each quest. If you do not win 16 out of 20 (every quest!), this means your deck is crap and you have to improve it. Good luck, we would really appreciate detailed, move by move session reports."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55078-dead-marshes-spoilers-all-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=545736","commentId":545736,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1319275120,"content":"So far I like all existing quests (except Emin Muil) and their printed difficulty really doesn't mean that much, as difficulty level also scales with the amount of players : Dol Guldur with 4 people is easy, whereas Hunt for Gollum with 4 players is significantly increased in difficulty.\n\n \n\nBack to the Dead Marshes: This AP includes a couple of very powerful cards, I think its the most \"powerful\" addition across the board so far:\n\nElfheim reads \"whenever your threat increases reduce the amount by 1 except during the refreshing phase\" and Silvan Tracker heals 1 point from every Silvan Character in the game...\n\nThe Tactic cards are great: low cost eagle and damage redirection. Boromir, a self-refreshing killer.\n\nDunedain Cache and Fast Hitch are very good auxiliary cards.\n\nThat makes me ask if FFG will increase the challenge provided by the Kazad-Dum/Dwarrowdelf quests? Not because I think this game is too easy but with such powerful player cards in your deck, an averagely difficult Kazad Dum quest will be easier to solve than Anduin with the card pool available at that time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55078-dead-marshes-spoilers-all-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=545856","commentId":545856,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1319301838,"content":"Marlow said:\n\nGlaur, look.

Also if you are finding all quests too easy it suggests to me that you might not be playing completely according to the rules. So I'd also like to see a step by step play through report type thing which shows how you are actually playing and getting the results you claim to be. Also I'd like to know how many times you play a quest before you decide its too easy, because I'd suggest playing a quest at least 5 times before making your mind up, Are you playing in a group or solo?. Personally I find Conflict at t he Carrock to be very challenging, also The Hunt for Gollum. So I'd have to disagree when you say its too easy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55078-dead-marshes-spoilers-all-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=545913","commentId":545913,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1319320413,"content":" If it's too easy then refrain from using three core sets worth of cards.\n\nTry it with using just a single core set plus expansions, and try to make two (or three) playable decks with those cards.

Journey down the Anduin and Hunt for Gollum I've always beaten with two+ players, but will often lose when playing solo. Escape from Dol Goldur, Conflict at Carrock, and Journey to Rosgobel all just kick my butt every single time.

I'm telling you the Hunters from Mordor combined with the Signs of Gollum will absolutely smash you. I suggest you use Denethor, Dunhere and Eowyn as Heroes. I've played this at least 6-10 times in the last week or so. I've only won once. You have to manage threat very carefully, you don't have any excess resource generation and only a little card advantage. Also even though Dunhere can attack enemies in the staging area he only has 3 attack (with his ability), Hunters from Mordor has 2 defence, so it will take 6 turns just to kill one. If there is a Signs of Gollum in play Hunters goes up by 2 threat and 2 attack for each one. So you're in trouble of you leave it in the staging area and also if you engage, and if there is more than one hunters, you're pretty much completely boned. There is no way I would call that scenario easy. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55078-dead-marshes-spoilers-all-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=546528","commentId":546528,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1319456385,"content":"For all who are interested: on BGG (link in the first post of this thread) the original poster has explained now how escape mechanics work and tells a bit more about the quest cards."}]}
