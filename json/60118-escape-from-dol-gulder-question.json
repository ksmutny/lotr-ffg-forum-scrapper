In the initial setup, I drew two treachery cards to be placed on two objective cards. The first was Necromancer's Reach which I discarded without issue because nobody was exhausted. The second was Under The Shadow which I also discarded without issue because I have not started the game yet so I am not even in a phase. Were these the correct responses?\n\n2. If I am good with how I handled #1, I now have two available Objective cards to attach to a hero. Can I attach either of these objective cards to the hero I chose as my \"prisoner\"?\n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60118-escape-from-dol-gulder-question/?do=findComment&comment=591144","commentId":591144,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1328615472,"content":" 1.
