Checked the manual for it, and the deckbuilding section doesn't say you can't. For some reason I must have assumed you needed a living hero to play those, even at 0-cost. Well, that does give us a lot more options for deckbuilding. All this time I've been playing it wrong (luckily so far I haven't played that much). :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nEdited October 8, 2014 by Marginal0"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124392-playing-foreign-spheres/?do=findComment&comment=1292487","commentId":1292487,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1412773667,"content":"Uhm. Checked the rulesbook and found this (pag. 12, emphasys mine):\n\n \n\nCards with a cost of zero do not require a resource to be spent in order to pay their cost, but they do require at least one hero under that player’s control to have a resource icon that matches the card’s sphere."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124392-playing-foreign-spheres/?do=findComment&comment=1292488","commentId":1292488,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1412773678,"content":"Unfortunately you have been right all along you indeed must control a hero of that sphere even to play 0 cost cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124392-playing-foreign-spheres/?do=findComment&comment=1301625","commentId":1301625,"userName":"Nizi","timestamp":1413453097,"content":"Oops.
