We have been using the decks from Beorns path from Beorns website. My son uses leadership/lore and I use the spirit/ tactics. My question is do you recommend this going forth with him adding new leadership lore and I the spirit tactic cards from expansions to make sure we cover all cards or is there a better strategy?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183214-deck-question-going-forward-from-core/?do=findComment&comment=1703560","commentId":1703560,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1437808289,"content":"The possible strategies are nearly endless. The best thing to do is experiment, now that you have experiance, and find a way to express yourself through deckbuilding. It is fun to win, but more fun to win with something you make yourself. Check the strategy forums for ideas, or post your own decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183214-deck-question-going-forward-from-core/?do=findComment&comment=1703646","commentId":1703646,"userName":"awp832","timestamp":1437823568,"content":"there's no right way to do it.    You might find you have a favorite hero, or favorite faction,  and want to buy cards that will compliment them.   Your decks may change,  in fact they should change, that's part of the fun.\n\nPersonally I have had a lot of success in 2player with Leadership/Tactics and Spirit/Lore.    The Leadership/tactics deck generally smashes enemies, while spirit/lore concentrates on questing.   \n\nBut I have played a spirit/tactics rohan deck with a lore/leadership gondor ranger deck,  and it was fun.    Ultimately I found it probably harder.   lore/leadership can sort of fight, and it can sort of quest,   same with tactics/spirit.    These decks are very balanced towards all aspects of the game.\n\nWith spirit/lore and tactics/leadership you are sort of doubling-down on your chosen sphere's particular strengths (and weaknesses).   Tactics/leadership is very good at killing monsters, and spirit/lore is very good at questing.   Generally speaking though, if you're forced to engage a tough enemy with your spirit/lore deck, you can be in trouble, as you just dont have great ways to kill things.   Then  you have to find ways around these weaknesses (ranged and sentinel are a good start).   That's deckbuilding for you though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183214-deck-question-going-forward-from-core/?do=findComment&comment=1704451","commentId":1704451,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1437900440,"content":"> there's no right way to do it.    You might find you have a favorite hero, or favorite faction,  and want to buy cards that will compliment them.   Your decks may change,  in fact they should change, that's part of the fun.\n> \n> Personally I have had a lot of success in 2player with Leadership/Tactics and Spirit/Lore.    The Leadership/tactics deck generally smashes enemies, while spirit/lore concentrates on questing.   \n> \n> But I have played a spirit/tactics rohan deck with a lore/leadership gondor ranger deck,  and it was fun.    Ultimately I found it probably harder.   lore/leadership can sort of fight, and it can sort of quest,   same with tactics/spirit.    These decks are very balanced towards all aspects of the game.\n> \n> With spirit/lore and tactics/leadership you are sort of doubling-down on your chosen sphere's particular strengths (and weaknesses).   Tactics/leadership is very good at killing monsters, and spirit/lore is very good at questing.   Generally speaking though, if you're forced to engage a tough enemy with your spirit/lore deck, you can be in trouble, as you just dont have great ways to kill things.   Then  you have to find ways around these weaknesses (ranged and sentinel are a good start).   That's deckbuilding for you though.\n\nI use Tactics/Leadership and Lore/Spirit decks and could not agree more with this."}]}
