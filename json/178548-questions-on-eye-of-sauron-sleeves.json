I do not own any Dragon Shield sleeves, so I cannot compare the FFG Art sleeves to those. I will say that in 3 years of use I have yet to damage an FFG sleeve, so they are certainly sturdy enough for my needs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178548-questions-on-eye-of-sauron-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=1639772","commentId":1639772,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1432833780,"content":"Thank you!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178548-questions-on-eye-of-sauron-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=1639854","commentId":1639854,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1432837282,"content":"ok, so for me, they will definitely cover the difference but I wont say that they are invincible.  first off, when I got them, they started to slowly split when I would shuffle them, and now I am just supper careful and it doesn't happen any more.   They do hold up so, considering only 2 or 3 have ever broken, but I would say you have to be very careful with them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178548-questions-on-eye-of-sauron-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=1640583","commentId":1640583,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1432885571,"content":"Art sleeves are scarce where I live, but I use FFG's transparent ones. I too find that overall they hold together rather well - I've only had one or two split, and that was due to reckless/forced shuffling by someone else. A friend is using the Daughter of the Nimrodel art sleeves for his player deck and he's had no problems with them."}]}
