Or w/e.. what I mean is there are some drastically different and awesome things they could be doing. Treachery cards for example completely stop play until they are instantly resolved. This could be used to do much more than a bad affect. It could be used as a random story element to be introduced into the quest for example something that is neither good or bad but extended the depth of the quest itself.
