I like what you've done so far. The difficult and great thing about this game is that rating heroes and player cards is so subjective. A card that I love and think is great, someone else might think is absolute garbage, and vice versa. But I think writing these kinds of articles is all the more fun because of that fact. It leads to rich debates and discussions. As the game grows and gets more complex, these kinds of \"beginners\" guides will be all the more important to make sure new players can still find the game accessible. Keep it up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75565-an-analysis-on-the-heroes-of-middle-earth-for-inexperienced-adventurers/?do=findComment&comment=734134","commentId":734134,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1355508752,"content":"Yes! That's the beauty of it.\nA guy commented about that there as well, and I already foresee this happening with my review of Imrahil. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"}]}
