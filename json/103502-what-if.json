And I see their point. Still, I think it would be quite simple to add \"Noble\" before hero, or, better still, \"Gondor Noble\". But going for less limitation, implying Steward of Gondor is more about his favour than presence, it could also have a simple phrase \"Play only if you control a Gondor Noble hero.\" One would then still have a plenty of options and both camps (theme and mechanics) could be satisfied.\n\nEdited April 9, 2014 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103502-what-if/?do=findComment&comment=1043506","commentId":1043506,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1397064127,"content":"Steward of Gondor:  \n\n \n\nincrease the cost to 3 (so it doesn't instantly pay for itself)\n\n \n\nor\n\n \n\nreduce the resource gain to 1 per trigger (still beastly awesome)\n\n \n\nor\n\n \n\nrequire attached hero to exhaust to trigger (hmmm... fund-raise or govern)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103502-what-if/?do=findComment&comment=1043734","commentId":1043734,"userName":"FeloniusBard","timestamp":1397074594,"content":"Steward of Gondor is pretty much the poster child for the biggest problem with the LOTR LCG---the game doesn't quite know whether it wants to be a true \"deck builder,\" where you should always build the \"best\" deck possible regardless of \"theme,\" or whether all of the interlocking card synergies should only work in \"thematically appropriate\" ways. \n\n \n\nSteward of Gondor is insanely powerful. It's pretty much the biggest no-brainer card to include in any deck that has a Leadership hero. Yet it's thematically inappropriate for pretty much everything EXCEPT a Gondor deck.\n\n \n\nSo as a \"thematic\" player, you're essentially forced to NOT USE an incredibly powerful, useful card, because TOLKIEN WOULD NEVER DO THAT . . . or you just take the attitude that winning the game is more important than theme. \n\n \n\nI think the game's designers, if they'd thought about it hard enough, could have done more to solve both problems from the outset, rather than trying to solve it afterwards in the expansions. \n\nEdited April 9, 2014 by FeloniusBard"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103502-what-if/?do=findComment&comment=1043924","commentId":1043924,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1397083695,"content":"Presuming i'm in the minority, but I'm fine with the card.  Its extremely powerful, but hey, this is a card game.  Every card game has staples"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103502-what-if/?do=findComment&comment=1043953","commentId":1043953,"userName":"Demoncow","timestamp":1397085746,"content":"> Presuming i'm in the minority, but I'm fine with the card.  Its extremely powerful, but hey, this is a card game.  Every card game has staples\n\nI'm with you on that!!!
