There is shadow cards that give +1 attack for each shadow, so you hope the previous one were discarded.\n\n \n\nHowever, I always considered the bonus lasting until the end of the attack (because it says \"attacking ennemy\") and independant from the shadow... if an ennemy gained +2 atk from a shadow card that specifically says \"until the end of the round\", and make an additional attack in the same phase, I considered it to still have the bonus for the additional attack. And nowhere I see why the enemy should lost the bonus from the shadow card after it is resolved and then discarded.
