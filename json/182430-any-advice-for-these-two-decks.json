It also uses Gondorian Shield, Steward and Elven Mail (or Arwen) to turn Elrohir into a super defender rather than Support of the Eagles. \n\n \n\nHeroes:\nLegolas - 9\nElladan - 10\nElrohir – 10\n \nStarting threat – 29\n \nAllies: (19)\n \n3x - Gandalf (Core)\n3x - Envoy of Pelargir\n3x - Naith Guide\n3x - Gondorian Spearman\n3x - Galadhon Archer\n1x - Faramir\n1x - Boromir\n2x - Galadriel\n1x - Erestor\n \nAttachments: (22)\n2x - Rivendell Bow\n3x - Steward of Gondor\n3x - Gondorian Shield\n3x - Rivendell Blade\n3x - Bow of the Galadhrim\n3x - Dunedain Mark\n3x - Elven Mail\n1x - O Lorien\n \nEvents: (9)\n3x - Feint\n3x - Sneak Attack\n3x - Feigned Voices\n \nMy deck focuses on Steward a little too much though and without it the high cost leadership allies cannot be played. Other than that though it was quite a powerful combat oriented deck (not as good as the new version with Sam however!). With yours I would definitely cut down on events a little, you probably don't need 3 copies of quick strike AND hands upon the bow. I would just go with Hands Upon the Bow and maybe even drop quick strike altogether. I would also drop unseen strike as I have never been a fan of it unless you are running secrecy or a deck that will be able to take advantage of it late game as well as early. Do you really get much use out of Stand Together either? I would think that with Support of the Eagles this wouldn't really be necessary. Do you put Steward on Elrohir or another hero? If you put it on him I would definitely put a few copies of Gondorian Shield for any times that Support of the Eagles does not show up or does not provide as much as you want it to. If you put Steward on Elrohir I also recommend Naith Guide which I think is one of the best allies in the game. \nDefinitely recommend a few more weapon attachments or even Dunedain Mark to supplement Support of the Eagles. \nWith two tactics heroes I think Boromir and Rumil allies are also worth considering. Same goes for Galadhon Archer really. \nAlso if you include Galadhon Archers or Naith Guides you could also include Feigned Voices.\nHope my suggestions help =) Sorry they are so \"move away from eagles include more attachments and elves\" oriented  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\nI used eagles way too much and too long when I first got the game and got super over them, I just think there are better and more powerful options for tactics/combat decks. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182430-any-advice-for-these-two-decks/?do=findComment&comment=1691782","commentId":1691782,"userName":"Virani","timestamp":1436861239,"content":"Thanks! No problem at all about the suggestions.\n\nAlthough I have never heard of half of the cards you mention, I will definitely look into these suggestions!\n\nEven though I have almost every expansion up to date, I haven't opened all of them since I wanted to expand my card pool a bit slowly. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182430-any-advice-for-these-two-decks/?do=findComment&comment=1692084","commentId":1692084,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1436887304,"content":"Decks look good man!"}]}
