The article will mark the first of 7 articles on the site that will go in depth on the individual contracts. The list also features a link to a folder with several alt art hero versions of some popular allies for this contract that you can print and use in your games. You can find the article here: https://visionofthepalantir.com/2020/02/24/messenger-of-the-king/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2020/02/24/messenger-of-the-king/]\n\nI will try and get out the article on the Fellowship contract for March, but in the meantime, if anyone has a published decklist using the Messenger of the King contract on RingsDB, then I would love to feature them in the article, so leave a link in the comments. Other people can get a taste for this contract by trying your deck and making variations on it. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306203-messenger-of-the-king-targets/?do=findComment&comment=3901271","commentId":3901271,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1582579592,"content":"One quick thought.

Triggering Hirgons ability with be great with Gwaihir.\n\nSilvans go in and out of play a lot.  Eagles go in, and the cheaper ones eventually go away, but they have limited recursion and are expensive.  Typically in my Eagles decks it's just the Vassals and Guardians that go away, and they do that to buff Misty and are never seen again.\n\nNow it may be the case (and hopefully is the case) that there's a yet-as-unrevealed card or cards to make Eagle recursion easier, or at least a cheap eagle that can easily return to hand, like Messenger Raven can do to provide action advantage for Radagast.  It's hard to see why a once-per-phase limitation is necessary otherwise.  But as it stands, you have to have an eagle coming or going for Gwaihir to even get the readying other heroes get for free, and two for him to get action advantage *at all*.\n\nWith currently revealed cards, Gwaihir would be fairly costed *without* his limitation and with his power.  Radagast readies normally and yet gets action advantage when any creature is played.  Imrahil readies normally and yet readies when any character leaves.  Gwaihir's in-built readying covers both but is also more narrow, and combined with the limitation he *needs* both in the same turn to get any action advantage at all.  And he's got tremendous threat cost.\n\nNow if Eagles get something akin to Elvenking, things change, and you can mulligan for a key attachment that will make Gwaihir more attractive.  But I've played Eagles decks, and I've had plenty of turns where I neither played an eagle nor saw one leave play -- those aren't turns where I can also afford my most powerful hero not readying!\n\nGwaihir ally has lesser stats, and his ability is wasted; but he does ready normally, and that's worth quite a bit.  It's the same reason you might consider ally Beorn over hero Beorn -- he lacks the cool power, but lacks the significant disadvantage as well.\n\nI don't know why you think Landroval would \"basically discard a hero\".  Landroval-hero would have the option of saving another hero if it gets destroyed, but choosing him certainly doesn't adversely affect other heroes.  His problem is that he's essentially just stats and the stats aren't particularly well-distributed for a hero -- sentinel with 1 defense isn't very useful (especially without restricted attachments) and he only has 1 willpower.  But the Eagle trait and 9 threat for 3 attack makes him the best option if you're just trying to enable Gwaihir's debt and want to use Meneldor for location control.\n\nMeneldor's 7 threat, but you wouldn't run Meneldor for threat alone -- you run him with an Istari hero for Gwaihir's Debt.  Radagast, Meneldor and a Pipe can assure it always finds Gandalf, throw in Hama as the third hero and you can play Gwaihir's Debt a lot!  The biggest downside is losing Meneldor's ability, though there's a handful of quests where 2 progress placed during setup can really get you off to a good start.\n\nYes, Hirgon's ability synergizes well with hero Gwaihir's ability.  But you have to play an Eagle *every* turn and quest successfully *every* turn just to make up hero Gwaihir's disadvantage.  If you're doing both of those things every turn, the quest is *already* going well for you; if you're not it might not be going so well, a bad time for Gwaihir to go on vacation."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306203-messenger-of-the-king-targets/?do=findComment&comment=3901764","commentId":3901764,"userName":"EBerling","timestamp":1582643908,"content":"> 5 hours ago, General_Grievous said:\n> \n> Still have to test these, but as a huge Eagles and Ents fan, here are my top two picks for each trait with the new hero options:\n> \n>  \n> \n> Secrecy tactics staging area attacking, with resources and card draw (not things you would expect in Tactics for sure):\n> \n>  \n> \n> https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14638/middle-earthairstrikes-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14638/middle-earthairstrikes-1.0]\n> \n>  \n> \n> Or for the (almost once we get the last eagle allies) final form of Eagles decks and their summoning of Gandalf:\n> \n>  \n> \n> https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14639/wizardsandeagles-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14639/wizardsandeagles-1.0]\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> Orthanc Unleashed\n> \n> Saruman and Grima are a great natural pair-up but if you need someone low Threat, Ioreth is the top, and will help you with healing your strong allies.\n> \n>  \n> \n> https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14672/orthancunleashed-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/14672/orthancunleashed-1.0]\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> Villains of Middle-Earth\n> \n> We all know Firyal is going to be the new best Lore hero, so here is my first attempt to make Smeagol useful while keeping Threat low for Grima's resource boosting.\n> \n>  \n> \n> https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/195623 [https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/195623]\n\n\n\n\nYou're either very brave, very lucky, or very crazy running only one copy of your MotK target ally in each of those decks.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n\nShould we start a Change.org petition to have Contract Set-Up timing moved back to immediately after Hero Set-Up timing?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306203-messenger-of-the-king-targets/?do=findComment&comment=3901806","commentId":3901806,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1582646601,"content":"I'd sign."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306203-messenger-of-the-king-targets/?do=findComment&comment=3901902","commentId":3901902,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1582652666,"content":"When is contract set-up currently?
