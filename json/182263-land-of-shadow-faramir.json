With just 1 it's enough, as long as it's good enough to run 3 copies of it. Trap decks don't actually run that many traps, since there's still basic lore stuff that is necessary, and deck space is small. Not to mention that the best trap we have and the only one that really warrants 3 copies is still Ranger Spikes. In any case I really doubt we'll get another lore version. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182263-land-of-shadow-faramir/?do=findComment&comment=1688454","commentId":1688454,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1436559343,"content":"That's the point.
