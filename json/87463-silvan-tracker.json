My English is not so good but anyway...\n\nSince all characters untag simultaneity all in 1go. then you can use a response only once since it was one move.\n\nIf they do 1 by 1 then yes you can do for all.  But they do all in 1 go. So you can use 1 response per tracker. with 2 tracker yes 2 characters. Same for another card  Song of Erendil where one player can take another player threat on him. But you a take only one threat per 1 copy of Song of Erendil. So if threat is add by 5 you can take 1 threat per copy of Song of Erendil.\n\nHope i got my points"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=827009","commentId":827009,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1375218129,"content":"Wow, if Glaurung is right, that completely alters how I thought the card worked.

If 5 characters are killed by a treachery effect, you can trigger the Horn of Gondor's effect 5 times.  Again not a perfect parallel, since damage is resolved individually.  But that's why I brought up the Questing phase -- committing characters to a quest IS done simultaneously, but you can still trigger separate responses off of that one \"en masse\" event.\n\nEdited July 31, 2013 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=827280","commentId":827280,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1375241208,"content":"That was a big rambling post, but the point was that in the questing phase we have a block of characters that change state simultaneously, but we still have to recognize that each card exhausts as a discrete event, and can trigger individual responses accordingly.  So whether characters ready simultaneously or not in the refresh phase should be a moot point-- Silvan Tracker can heal them all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=827412","commentId":827412,"userName":"-nebur-","timestamp":1375256450,"content":" Very interesting thoughts...but I favour that all can be healed.\n\n \n\n> Same for another card  Song of Erendil where one player can take another player threat on him.

It is broken. Actually to be honest all healing effect in this game is boken.\n\nFor example combo with Elrond and Godorian healer is crazy powerful.
