[http://www.geckoth.com/dump/bgg/Feonix%203%20-%20CullingBarrowDowns.zip]\n\nIf you have card sleeves all you need to do is print them out on normal paper and put an original card in teh sleeve and palce the print out in front of it... than play. It requires 1 copy of core as it uses the core encounter cards as it is prety old.. still I think it is one of the best quest for this game. much better than than most ffg versions.\n\nAnother guys quest is Ninjabutter's ones I think it is called... he has made about 6 or 7.\n\nThere is also a series called Orks were you play as orks agaist the good guys that is kinda fun. Basiclay you control the encounter deck.\n\n> lower quality-\n\nwhy do people think this? It comes from the same printer, on the same stock.. it is totally indistinguishable from the \"real\" cards"}]}
