Would that be Sneak Attack or the card before? Does Sneak Attack persist 'in play' until all of the weaver's effects are resolved, or even all of its own (lasts until the end of the phase)? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226893-discarding-events/?do=findComment&comment=2348180","commentId":2348180,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1470474028,"content":"There's been a ruling on this, but I don't remember where to find it. But basically, when you play an event, you resolve all its text and then it goes into your discard pile. So when you Sneak Attack a Galadhrim Weaver into play, the top card of your discard pile before you played that Sneak Attack is what gets shuffled into your deck, then the Sneak Attack ends up on your discard pile. If you then use a second Sneak Attack to put a second Galadhrim Weaver into play, the first Sneak Attack (which was on top of your discard pile after the previous play) gets shuffled into your deck, and the second Sneak Attack ends up on top of your discard pile."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226893-discarding-events/?do=findComment&comment=2348266","commentId":2348266,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1470479115,"content":"Cool, that makes the most sense.\n\n \n\nLuckily in a Silvan deck there are plenty of cards I want to recycle more than Sneak Attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226893-discarding-events/?do=findComment&comment=2348562","commentId":2348562,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1470492226,"content":"The Weaver is a closet Noldor."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226893-discarding-events/?do=findComment&comment=2352073","commentId":2352073,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1470646593,"content":"The answer was on our french forum. \n\nhttp://sdajce.forumactif.org/t5151-galadhrim-weaver-une-tres-bonne-histoire-timing-reponse-et-resolution-d-une-action [http://sdajce.forumactif.org/t5151-galadhrim-weaver-une-tres-bonne-histoire-timing-reponse-et-resolution-d-une-action]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226893-discarding-events/?do=findComment&comment=2366307","commentId":2366307,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1471278208,"content":"> The answer was on our french forum. \n> \n> http://sdajce.forumactif.org/t5151-galadhrim-weaver-une-tres-bonne-histoire-timing-reponse-et-resolution-d-une-action [http://sdajce.forumactif.org/t5151-galadhrim-weaver-une-tres-bonne-histoire-timing-reponse-et-resolution-d-une-action]\n\nWow...
