One of the things that I thought was best about Shadow of Mordor was the way they handled the area around the Sea of Nurn. It actually directly explained how Sauron's armies are fed and housed which was fairly interesting. If this game (LCG) were to do something somewhat similar with that part of Mordor (more green and lush than originally thought, source of food and slaves for the armies of Mordor, actually fairly populated by Men albeit either Slaves or Black Numenorians) I definitely wouldn't be upset. It makes sense for Sauron to have a portion of Mordor actually usable for food and whatnot and we have very little concrete info about that part of Mordor. \n\nI do have to say that I strongly disagree re the LCG playing with ideas not mentioned by Tolkien more than Shadow of Mordor.\n\nEverything the LCG does is either based directly off the books or at least draws inspiration from the books. Even when inventing new places and enemies it uses the same languages, themes and ideas. Alternatively it will use names or concepts that are in the books but just never fleshed out or fully explained (Dwimmerlaik, Nekker Brekkers, Nameless things etc etc etc).\n\nAny content that is completely new is at least made so that it fits the world it is set in and is feasibly possible within Middle Earth. Shadow of Mordor has created its own weird version of what happens to the Elven Fea after death and has twisted how wraiths, the ring of power and Sauron work within that world. Celebrimbor never wore or used the one ring, never raised an army of his own in Mordor and most definitely did not return to Middle Earth after his death. The core parts of Shadow of Mordor and how Celebrimbor and Talion came to be directly conflicts with how wraiths, the afterlife and the spirit world works in Middle Earth.\n\nThe LCG may expand Tolkien's work more but does so in a way in which it fits perfectly into the world it is set in and only furthers Tolkien's original vision rather than changing it. \n\n \n\nEdited August 10, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226924-characters-we-havent-seen-yet/?do=findComment&comment=2356863","commentId":2356863,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1470816564,"content":"> That would be god awful.... that game whilst an amazing game completely butchers the lore and creates its own version of Middle Earth.

I know LoV gets around this but just on his own as a card he is fairly thematic as he raises threat (gaining the attention and focus of the enemy) just by simply being around and partaking in the quest at hand at all.\nMy decks focus on several strong characters with multiple attachments and multiple readying effects. I don't run that many weaker allies and those that I do serve very specific functions. Yes many decks focus on ally swarming but there are all sorts of powerful decks including many that do not use a horde of weak characters and instead focus on several key characters becoming absolute beasts or even just one (Boromir and Gandalf).\nEven with strong buffed up characters you do need to use multiple attackers to take out stronger foes but that is just sort of the nature of a card game like this one. If our characters were beasts and had similar stats to enemies at the start of a quest there would be no challenge. Once you get an attachment heavy deck going however you can easily use a single hero to defend against or destroy multiple enemies per turn which is extremely satisfying and a bit more thematic.\nI do see where you are coming from and somewhat agree in regards to some of the art we get as well as the horde of weak characters argument however it is inevitable that the art is at least somewhat influenced by the movies and you can easily use decks that avoid swarms of allies but are still strong. I think that most of the things that can make gameplay seem unthematic can easily be avoided with the right decks.

In this system, for balance reasons your average Orc needs to be stronger than your average character, because the player can (if they choose) easily control more characters on the board than the encounter deck can provide.\n\n \n\nNow everyone knows all but the most exceptional Orcs in the LotR are weak, malnourished fodder for mighty heroes like Aragorn, Boromir and Sam. Even the biggest breeds are \"almost man-high\", not the muscle-bound creatures of your Skyrim or WoW. The Orcs considered killing Boromir while losing dozens of their number to him alone a big accomplishment.\n\n \n\nEnemies like Ringwraiths aren't deadly combatants, either.
