So you can pay with your new sphere (i.e. a Tactics hero with Song of Wisdom) the cost of A Burning Brand (hence you pass the Resource Match -page 12 of LOTR rules, phase 2 - ) and put it in a Lore hero (the Tactics hero of the example above is now a Tactics/Lore hero, so he can use it)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51362-song-of-wisdom-burning-brand/?do=findComment&comment=512903","commentId":512903,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1313054802,"content":"I agree that you can play it on a hero with Song of Wisdom since it give that characte a Lore icon.

They also indicate to which sphere(s) the hero card itself belongs.”\n\n * Song of Wisdom states, “Attached hero gains a [Lore] resource icon.”\n\n* A Burning Brand states, “Attach to a [Lore] character.”\n\nGiven that a Leadership character such as Aragorn belongs to the Leadership sphere only because he has a Leadership resource icon, if you were to grant him another resource icon, Lore (through Song of Wisdom), he would in turn belong to the Lore sphere as well, thus becoming a Leadership/Lore character and therefore an eligible target for A Burning Brand. Likewise, his resources would also belong to both spheres, so he could be the hero with the resource match used to pay for A Burning Brand."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51362-song-of-wisdom-burning-brand/?do=findComment&comment=513115","commentId":513115,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1313076189,"content":"What if you later lose the Song of Wisdom?\n\nDiscard A Burning Brand, or is the restriction applicable only \"when you play\" the card, and not afterward?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51362-song-of-wisdom-burning-brand/?do=findComment&comment=513119","commentId":513119,"userName":"Jekzer","timestamp":1313077051,"content":"SiCK_Boy said:\n\nWhat if you later lose the Song of Wisdom?\n\nDiscard A Burning Brand, or is the restriction applicable only \"when you play\" the card, and not afterward?\n\n\n\n \n\nAnother question for the FAQ :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png].

The former's requirement applies when attaching it, whilst the latter's bonus applies any time. So I conclude that you only need a Lore hero when you play A Burning Brand but you only get the bonus out of Dwarven Axe when attached hero is a Dwarf. This will probably never happen but if there were a card giving a Dwarf trait which the hero would have later lost, he would not longer be getting the +2 but only +1 instead.
