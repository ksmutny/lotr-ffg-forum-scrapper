For instance, shadow cancellation or discard is in many colors and colors other than green can draw cards in different was (foe hammer, ancient mathom). Sometimes the color identity just means that one color is better than others or the effect in question must be tied to a certain area (like combat for red).\n\nIt seems to me that red is also allowed to do resource generation with cards like the Horn or Mablung. Red is just not as good as purple and, like all things red, it needs a connection to combat in some way. Spirit, however, should not have resource generation, in my opinion. If it did it would be a card like ranger supplies, but that still feels better in purple IMO."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907374","commentId":1907374,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1448465134,"content":"Maybe it's as simple as Arwen gives one Noldor character +1 attack and another Noldor character +1 defense."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907377","commentId":1907377,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1448465326,"content":"I still think it will have something to do with discard though as this was hinted at in the video."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907393","commentId":1907393,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1448465923,"content":"Have you heard of Zigil Miner?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1907521","commentId":1907521,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1448471765,"content":"I think Zigil Miner is a poorly designed card in terms of flavor.

For instance, I agree that ready effects are fine in Spirit, but I draw a distinction between a character readying himself (or herself with Idrean) and an outside effect readying a character. When the ready effect is internal it exemplifies spirit. When an outside force ready that signifies leadership. Now by this UC is perfectly within flavor, so I my problem with it is more that it is too cheap (should probably cost 3) or should be limited to blue heroes. Those kind of limits don't apply to purple IMO. That being said, I also love the flavor of food having a ready effect (cram, lembas). All such comments from me are in the tone of \"if I designed LOTR\" and not meant as an criticism of the actual game :-)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1909150","commentId":1909150,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1448584735,"content":"I think that Spirit is mostly good for questing boost and threat reduction.\n\n \n\nLeadership is mostly good for readying effects and for resources."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194296-dinner-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=1909261","commentId":1909261,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1448598066,"content":"In addition to readying and resource acceleration, Leadership has stat-boosting as a sub-theme.
