If you think that's bad, prepare to weep as you enter Khazad-Dum (Sudden Pitfall: \"Shadow: Discard the defending character from play.\", bam, could easily be two heroes lost) and Road to Rivendell (infamous Sleeping Sentry: \"Shadow: Defending player must discard all exhausted characters he controls.\").
