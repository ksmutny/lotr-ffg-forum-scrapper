I havent tried using 3 spheres but I imagine the difficulty someone gives themself when using 3 spheres...You gotta wait few turns before getting enough resources for 'high-cost cards' or use 'low-cost' cards to at least get something going early!\n\nI always put in one of the song cards to switch the resource produced(In the adventure packs). So my strategy so far is use 2 hero of same sphere...include some 'high-cost' cards with that sphere. The other hero will include 'low-cost' cards with his/her sphere only.

Spirit and Lore is by far the strongest spheres in the core set and arguably the strongest spheres in the game still, so I think you should be looking at them for the most part. Then splash leadership. This seams to me to be the strongest deck for people running a single copy of core.\n\nIf you are running 3 spheres then you need mana fixing, and the best way to glue a deck together at this point in the card pool is Theodred. He has a Leadership icon, so allows you to cast Leadership spells, but you want his ability to send resources to the other 2 spheres, lore and spirit. He allows you to basically draw 2 resources of lore or spirit a turn (just remember to collect the resource you must go questing with him) So only add cheap 1, or at a stretch 2 cost leadership stuff. Scouts for example, steward for resource collection, and sneak attack.So we are already at 8/50 card for leadership right there.\n\nWith a single copy of core the choices are very limited, and it is very hard to get into, witch i believe, is the best part of this game.. the deck building. Once you get to owning the other sets you can splash a lot easier using songs, lucky?/by design the strongest spheres are lore and spirit, so splashing tactics and/or leadership gets easier and easier due to most people running lore and having the Minstrel song fetch spell at hand... so you have a 2 power quester + a fetch song, so Theodred becomes less and less needed to glue these things together.\n\nOnce you get Khaz, Ziggy allows you to run 4 sphere decks with no problem at all. You can even run single hero deck with 4 spheres no problem..."}]}
