Then you have quest and other encounter cards that add victory conditions or prevent victory.\n\n \n\nKilling all enemies is part of the second core set's scenario, and I think there is one or two other quest that have it, but it is always writen somewhere."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97582-rules-question-about-quest-progressing/?do=findComment&comment=961748","commentId":961748,"userName":"dims","timestamp":1390427004,"content":"cool, thanks"}]}
