The rule book seems somewhat disambiguous about it. \n\nFor example, can Foe-Hammer or Blood of Numenor be used in decks that don't run a respective tactics or spirit hero?

Similar question.\n\nWhen playing Escape from Dol Goldur, if the hero captured is the only hero with that sphere of influence, can you still play 0 cost cards from your hand that matches that influence?\n\nAs the hero doesn't collect resources it is the only cards from that sphere that I can play.\n\nHowever, technically that hero is not considered in play, therefore does that remove him from my control and ultimately the cardsof that sphere that I can play?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nLee"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75110-no-cost-player-cards-being-played-by-heroes-of-a-different-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=732162","commentId":732162,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1355127502,"content":"No, you can't play cards with the sphere of influence of the only hero who is captured in Escape from Dol Goldur"}]}
