A little more cartoony than her stuff but still really cool I reckon, especially the ornate door behind the courier!!!!\n\nAwesome new Silvan allies, both very useful, both extremely bouncable. The spirit one can be used consistently with bounce effects to get bonus stats from Celeborn each time and place progress each time it is played. The tactics one similarly can weaken an enemies defense each time it is played. Pretty **** good cards if you ask me... \n\n \n\nThe only issue with the tactics ally is how much better it seems to be than Mithlond Sea-watcher which makes me sad. It costs a single additional tactics resource and simply ALWAYS has 3 attack and ranged rather than only when the top card of your discard pile is an ally.... \n\nYes the Noldor ally has 1 willpower which the Silvan one does not but they both have 2 hp and not only does the Silvan always have 3 attack and ranged but it has a completely additional ability... yes most noldor discard decks will almost always have a way to get an ally on the top of your discard pile, yes Lords of the Eldar only boosts the Noldor ally and yes he has that one point of willpower as well but I honestly feel like they both fill the same niche and even though my decks are focused mainly on Noldor rather than Silvan I am really leaning towards including the Silvan ally rather than the Noldor one....\n\n1 more resource but you get the 3 attack and ranged permanently and not just under special circumstances and also get an additional ability to boot, AND even if you aren't playing Silvan encounter effects might put him back in your hand and you can then get multiple uses out of his secondary ability. I am sure there are decks in which each ally will perform better but I think this new Silvan ally trivialises the Noldor one except for in noldor discard decks... and even then there is still the potential for the silvan ally to be better... maybe I am just underestimating the value of paying 1 less resource hmmmmmmmmm"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201184-the-drowned-ruins/?do=findComment&comment=2029766","commentId":2029766,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1454482890,"content":"I actually don't care for Magali art. I would actually prefer more Elven art like thes ones Mithlond See-watcher, Galadriel ally, Lore Glorfindel, etc. More \"etheral\"/\"dreamy\" stuff. Less Peterjacksony stuff.\n\n \n\nBack on topic, am I the only one finding the Marksman of Lorien is waaaaaaay to powerful? The only other non-unique ally with 3 attack is the Knight of Minas Tirith, and this one does not have an ability unless you fullfill the mono-Tactics condition, whereas you may trigger every single time the Marksman's ability.\n\n \n\nHis attack value is even bumped to 4 by Celeborn. You could say the same about the Knight and Leadership Boromir, but obviously you won't be playing Leadership Boromir in a mono-tactics deck, whereas you use Celeborn a lot (most of the time, if not all) when playing Silvan.\n\n \n\nConsidering this ally can cost you only 2 resources using O Lorien, this is getting a 4 attack (then 3) for 2 cost. Which is overpowered. Especially when you compare this card to other 3-cost Tactics allly like... Horseback Archer? (Arguably this one can only be played for 2 with Théoden, but he does not have any ability other than Ranged).

In a certain light, the cloaks may appear to be green and/or brown. So is there any reason why we shouldn't think \"Maybe the elves in that artwork are standing under just that sort of light\" as opposed to \"Those elves are wearing the wrong clothes\" ?\n\nOn top of which, given again that the cloaks are supposed to be good camouflage, and that their colours seem to shift, perhaps the reason they're described repeatedly as grey is because their colours shift that way in twilight and in winter (as the forest itself is more grey at those times). Who's to say they don't look rather different in spring and summer?\n\nAlternatively, if you don't buy the colour-shifting interpretation, who's to say the elves of Lorien don't dress differently in different seasons, again for reasons of camouflage?

To suggest that all Lorien elves only ever wear grey at all times is a pretty big assumption given the very low number of examples we meet in the books.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the day, the artist was asked for an elf, and they drew/painted an elf, based on what they imagined such an elf would look like based on all sorts of inspirations.

So i guess we will have 2 tactics heroes in a row !\n\n \n\nThere's also a chance Tactics will only get 1 hero this cycle and perhaps Spirit will get two. Ignoring saga expansions (which the designers might be treating a a self-contained card pool, and which would require 1 Leadership, 1 Spirit and 2 Tactics heroes in the last two expansions to balance out the spheres), we currently have 12 Leadership, 13 Tactics, 12 Spirit, and 13 Lore heroes. Every deluxe + cycle since Heirs of Númenor has given us 2 heroes of each sphere. Shadows of Mirkwood + Khazad-dûm also does this, but Dwarrowdelf created an imbalance in favour of Tactics and Lore. We might get two same-sphere heroes in a row, but the only time that happened before was in Shadows of Mirkwood (Brand and Boromir). So they might be changing the non-Saga hero sphere balance to favour Spirit instead of Tactics (I doubt we'll get three Leadership heroes in the same cycle, but we already have three same-sphere in a deluxe + cycle: Bifur, Aragorn and Elrond). Spirit also has several of the generally acknowledged weaker heroes (Dunhere, Dwalin, Pippin, Fatty), so that shift wouldn't surprise me.\n\n \n\nFor The Drowned Ruins hero, Legolas is also a distinct possibility. We've been waiting for another hero version of Legolas since Core set, and Lore would fit. I think the next deluxe expansion has a good chance of being somewhere around Erebor, and Gimli, Legolas, and Thranduil are all possibilities for sometime near then. Most of the Silvan allies are Lórien themed, and it might be slightly odd to get Thranduil in the same pack as Marksman of Lórien, rather than some Mirkwood themed allies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201184-the-drowned-ruins/?do=findComment&comment=2031113","commentId":2031113,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1454528200,"content":"> Fallow fields by night aren't brown.

People in that game seem to wear much lighter clothes that are actually comfortable, like robes and tunics, as opposed to this where everyone wears lots of belts and buckles, which arguably are better for exploring or fighting, but why does Galadriel need a breastplate?

Contrast directly with Saruman's cloak of many colours.\n\nAnd the cloaks provide camouflage and blend into natural surroundings... even when the natural surroundings are GREEN.\n\n \n\nIt's a fair point that a silvan elf dressed in green and brown would be a better match for Mirkwood (Legolas is dressed in green and brown), than Lorien (Elves described there are in grey and white).  But the text does explicitly say the grey cloaks can appear green (and brown), and it shows it hiding them from the rohirrim on green grass.  Also, the few elves we see described in Lorien use two differing colors (grey and white) and nowhere does it prohibit them from wearing any colors beside these two.  (Nimrodel actually adds gold to the color mix in Legolas' song, and Appendix A has Galadriel clothing Aragorn in silver and white, with a cloak of elven grey and a bright gem.  At the wedding the fair folk of Lorien again have grey cloaks and white gems in their hair, but their clothes are not described.)\n\n \n\nIn the card in question, I think the green and brown appear muted enough and similar enough to the background to (I think) pass a basic plausibility test, though for an elf of Lorien a grey cloak would certainly be the best choice.  But you know, we've got a lot of Lorien associated cards:\n\n \n\nSilverlode Archer\n\nLorien Guide\n\nDaughter of Nimrodel\n\nHaldir of Lorien (ally)\n\nCeleborn\n\nNaith Guide\n\nRumil\n\nHaldir of Lorien (hero)\n\nGaladhrim Minstrel\n\nDefender of the Naith\n\nGaladhon Archer\n\nOrophin\n\nGaladriel's Handmaiden\n\nCloak of Lorien\n\nRossiel\n\nGaladhrim Weaver\n\nGaladhrim Healer\n\n \n\nCeleborn should be dressed in white and isn't, and while the rest should in reality *most likely* be dressed in \"elven grey\", I don't think any of them really are, including the card for the actual Cloak of Lorien.  Green and Brown appear frequently, but other colors also appear.  (Galadriel, not listed, is at least depicted in white.)  To the extent that there's a problem here, it neither began with this card nor is this card remarkable in any way as an offender.\n\n \n\nI don't blame Peter Jackson for how Elves are depicted.  The stereotypical high fantasy elvish \"look\" was established decades before Jackson's movies, and for better or worse that stereotypical elf was inspired directly by Tolkien."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201184-the-drowned-ruins/?do=findComment&comment=2032304","commentId":2032304,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1454581212,"content":"Manchester United wore a grey kit once in the nineties.

We didn't have a great record there anyway, but this game went really badly - we were a goal down pretty quickly, and three behind by half-time. Obviously something had to change.\n\n \n\nI'm not sure if any of the players mentioned the kit. Personally I felt that we were playing really poorly, and that we couldn't really blame anything or anyone but ourselves. Having said that, it was a bit tricky to see players. It was all right if you had a bit of time to look up and see what was happening, but you didn't see much if you only had time to glance. I think the weather had something to do with it too - the fact that it was so bright made our dull grey harder to make out.\n\n \n\nAnyway, I don't think anyone had time to complain. The manager just stormed in and said: \"Get that kit off, you're getting changed.\" Those were the first words he said at half-time. I don't think he liked the shirt anyway - our results had been poor whenever we wore it, and we certainly never played in it again.\n\n \n\nIt seems a bit strange that we were ready with a totally different kit to change into, but maybe it's because someone thought that the grey kit might be confused with Southampton's - although given that they wear red and white stripes it doesn't seem very likely. We wore blue and white in the second half, and played a bit better. I'd probably put it down to a mixture of the new kit and the manager's hairdryer treatment at half-time. We didn't let any more in and Ryan Giggs scored towards the end.\n\n---\n\nNote that it's the brightness, not the pitch color, that he attributes to making it difficult to see.  But is the effect comparable to the Riders of Rohan \"moving through a field that they assumed was empty\"?\n\n \n\nNot at all, IMO.  Unlike the soccer player having trouble when he takes a quick glance, the Riders had plenty of time to react.  Unlike the players, there were 105 of them to react.  Unlike the players, they were warriors who had recently fought a battle and were on high alert for further orcs.  Ugluk certainly had a high opinion of their skills of observation:\n\n \n\n\"But these Whiteskins have better night-eyes than most Men, from all I've heard, and don't forget their horses!  They can see the night-breeze, or so it's said.\"\n\n \n\nGrishnakh would probably share that opinion, given that he was detected by a faint ring and a small glint, at night, lying on the ground, in a wide open space with only one fire, and was hit by an arrow immediately and was quickly ridden down.\n\nHere's where the companions, sitting on the ground in their cloaks and waiting for the Rohirrim to notice them encountered the line of riders:\n\n \n\n\"In pairs they galloped by.  And though every now and then one rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side, they appeared not to perceive the three strangers sitting silently and watching them.  The host had almost passed when suddenly Aragorn stood up, and called in a loud voice:  'What news from the North, Riders of Rohan?'\n\n \n\nWith astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, and came charging round...\"\n\n \n\nAnd Eomer asks:  \"And strange too is your raiment.  Have you sprung out of the grass?  How did you escape our sight?  Are you elvish folk?\"\n\n \n\nThis clearly is not your garden variety camo.  You say that grey doesn't need to \"look green\" to be difficult to pick out against green, and I'll grant that may be true.  BUT -- the text of the Fellowship of the Ring clearly establishes that the cloaks, in fact, CAN look green.  Man United's lame/legitimate/superstitious (pick one) excuse about the poor visibility of their grey kit doesn't include the slightest hint that the cause is the grey looking green, but Tolkien explicitly says that the cloaks can look green when they are introduced.\n\n \n\nI don't get why you would criticize on thematic grounds, yet reject the text.\n\nEdited February 4, 2016 by dalestephenson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201184-the-drowned-ruins/?do=findComment&comment=2033130","commentId":2033130,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1454606233,"content":"> Can this argument get any more ridiculous?\n\nObviously it can!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201184-the-drowned-ruins/?do=findComment&comment=2033157","commentId":2033157,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1454607038,"content":"\"The green of shadowed leaves\" is not a generic grass green.
