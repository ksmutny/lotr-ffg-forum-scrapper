Their win/loss ratio was calculated, as was their total score (adding up all points from wins) and average score (total score / # of wins).\n\n \n\nThe total loss % for all players combined was also calculated on a per quest basis. The difficulty was then assigned based on this percentage. So if players lost the quest 0-9% of the time it would get Difficulty 1, 10-19% = Difficulty 2, etc.\n\n \n\nI think it's a brilliant idea and sounds like a good way to get the \"effective\" difficulty for a quest. I'd love if someone started it here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196076-2nd-leage-in-spanish-blog-susurros-del-bosque-viejo/?do=findComment&comment=1940989","commentId":1940989,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1450366205,"content":"Thanks Seastan, i really can't understand how points were given.

Your final scoring is the sumatory of all the scores in all scenarios for the event.\n\n \n\nThe considered parameters are:\n\n \n\n1. Your ratio of wins in that scenario\n\n2. Your best score.\n\n3. All of them, are modified by the calculated difficult of the scenario. (F.ex., if you win your 3 attempts in a scenario with a difficult 10, you'll get a bigger bonus that doing the same in a difficult 2 scenario).\n\n \n\nAnyway, I just \"copied\" the formulas, who made it was another user of the community, so I don't remember it at 100%.\n\nEdited December 17, 2015 by wehehe"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196076-2nd-leage-in-spanish-blog-susurros-del-bosque-viejo/?do=findComment&comment=1941111","commentId":1941111,"userName":"wehehe","timestamp":1450370315,"content":"Also, dear Beorn, if you remember, it was for that web which I asked your permission to use links to images on your website."}]}
