I once watched a tv interview of her where she genuinely said that while she didnt invent the creature of Hypogryph, as it was from myths and legends, that there was nothing at all written about them and so she had to make up a lot about them and she was the first to do this. I watched this while looking over at my shelf of D&D books, Fighting Fantasy books, Warhammer books and countless others full of fictional/mythic information about Hypogryphs. It just made me angry she said she was the first.\n\nIve also seen her claim so much originality in her setting without any mention of Diana Wyne Jones' Christomanci series or Jill Murphy's Worst Witch series. It just rubs me up the wrong way.\n\nSorry, soapbox moment.\n\nGetting kids reading is awesome though and I cant take that away from her."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220907-paging-jsbingly/?do=findComment&comment=2236333","commentId":2236333,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1464285238,"content":"Meh, get the other Harry - Harry Dresden."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220907-paging-jsbingly/?do=findComment&comment=2236343","commentId":2236343,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1464285596,"content":"> Meh, get the other Harry - Harry Dresden.\n\n \n\nTo hi-jack the thread more, did you see the kickstarter for the game for this?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220907-paging-jsbingly/?do=findComment&comment=2236353","commentId":2236353,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1464285967,"content":"Yeah, I get frequent e-mail updates from Evil Hat :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited May 26, 2016 by evilidler"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220907-paging-jsbingly/?do=findComment&comment=2236545","commentId":2236545,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1464291811,"content":"A Dresden Files Co-Op LCG I would be very on-board with!!\n\nJust finished Cold Days this very day!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220907-paging-jsbingly/?do=findComment&comment=2236591","commentId":2236591,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1464293118,"content":"Jim Butcher seems very approachable and friendly, so it could happen.

Tangential relation: Jim was inspired by Tolkien's works to become a writer.\n\n \n\nI wonder how close to CoC they would make it in structure, if this AH LCG were a real thing. There could be something like the spheres of LotR, but it would probably be called something like \"expertise\" (practical, martial, arcane, mythos knowledge?) or some other less mystical name. The theme and setting would probably be much like the other post-CoC Arkham products, in that you play the \"good guys\", or the ones who think they are anyway. So there would be independent investigators, law enforcement, scholars and even some sorcerers from The Order as the obvious choices. No cultists, as they'd belong in the encounter decks.\n\n \n\nIt would serve them well to bring over the general structure of LotR, with encounter decks created from different sets of cards for more variety in scenarios. I'd also hope for a campaign format where each scenario has a reward to bring with you to the next (saga style). Maybe also a sanity mechanic, with a hard difficulty where that doesn't regenerate in campaigns.\n\n \n\nAlthough in the general Cthulhu Mythos survival is often the best reward you could hope for :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220907-paging-jsbingly/?do=findComment&comment=2236638","commentId":2236638,"userName":"FetaCheese","timestamp":1464294611,"content":"I still can't find the source of the original pic and its poster hasn't replied.

Last year FFG announced Five Rings for this year. I think it's entirely plausible that they would announce AH LCG for next year. If it is a year away I wouldn't expect too many details. I hope they ask for playtesters though...\n\nIf this is a hoax - at some level, I'm not accusing Bingly because I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt - it's pretty well executed. I think it's possible that FFG planted this to see the reaction, but it's equally likely that they saw the reaction and decided to make an official no comment reaction and are now deciding if they want to run with it.\n\nI hope they run with it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220907-paging-jsbingly/?do=findComment&comment=2237203","commentId":2237203,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1464322661,"content":"Would that mean that LOTR LCG would end though?

Why have 1 top selling game when you can have two? After all, just because its coop doesnt mean it has too be a copy-pasted version of LoTR. Like netrunner vs AGot2.0 there is room to appreciate both.\n\nRemember that the only LCGs they've shut down so far have been dwindling in popularity for years and L5R which will be coming out soon won't be replacing another LCG.\n\n1 LCG doesn't have to die for another to live. In AH LCG case it might have been CoC LCG anyway.\n\nPeople need to stop thinking that just because we are getting the last Saga expansion the game will end. Its not a board game. Its original premise is that it takes place before the books specifically so that the game will have longevity."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220907-paging-jsbingly/?do=findComment&comment=2237368","commentId":2237368,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1464336392,"content":"> I'm sorry guys.\n\nAt least we're speculating the hell out of things, so we're getting some entertainment out of it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n> I really want to get a job from FFG if I live in the US, it may save a lot of money which spend on LCGs\n\nWouldn't that be the dream, right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220907-paging-jsbingly/?do=findComment&comment=2237547","commentId":2237547,"userName":"Supertoe","timestamp":1464351371,"content":"All right, I'll give Bingly the benefit of the doubt.

So, yeah, having one more doesn't imply one line has to die.\n\n \n\nThis said, everything's really \"shoulda coulda woulda\", time will tell. But in any case LotR is still selling a lot, so, why stop milking a good cow?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220907-paging-jsbingly/?do=findComment&comment=2237916","commentId":2237916,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1464364375,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > >  \n> > > \n> > > > Since your thread devolved through no fault of yours I wanted to start a new one.\n> > > > \n> > > > How did you find that image of the Arkham Horror LCG?\n> > > \n> > > I'm with Jhaleen now.
