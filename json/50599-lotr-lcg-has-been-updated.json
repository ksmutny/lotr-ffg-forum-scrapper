I've been using your site a bunch the last few weeks both on my computer and on my droid phone as it's a great, quick way to reference every card.\n\nThanks for making it and keeping it updated!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50599-lotr-lcg-has-been-updated/?do=findComment&comment=505721","commentId":505721,"userName":"Veybo","timestamp":1311886988,"content":"I also reference this site (http://lotrlcg.com/ [http://lotrlcg.com/]) often for card analysis and find it of great use.\n\nIt's also very beneficial to be able to see all the Hunt for Gollum cards in advance seeing as it is still not yet available here at my retailer in Australia.\n\nPS - not sure if you are interested in card text issues but for \"The Eagles are Coming!\" it's missing the word hand.  Also the text on \"Old Wives' Tale\" is missing a lot of text too.\n\nCheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50599-lotr-lcg-has-been-updated/?do=findComment&comment=505754","commentId":505754,"userName":"mason240","timestamp":1311893306,"content":"I am very interested in accuracy; let me know of any typos, no matter how minor. \n\nMy brain must have shut off when I was entering the last card...\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50599-lotr-lcg-has-been-updated/?do=findComment&comment=505804","commentId":505804,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1311905650,"content":"LotrLCG is indeed a good reference.
