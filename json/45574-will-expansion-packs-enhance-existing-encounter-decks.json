I don't see why the difficulty of the older encounter decks could not be increased so as to keep up with the increasing options that player decks will have on a monthly basis. I think, otherwise, the old encounter decks may become outdated fairly quickly. However, from reading the descriptions, it seems that the packs are adding new quests and it would then seem logical that they have new encounter decks.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45574-will-expansion-packs-enhance-existing-encounter-decks/?do=findComment&comment=457199","commentId":457199,"userName":"pwvogt","timestamp":1303402174,"content":"Darksbane said:\n\nI don't know this for sure but I'm expecting them not to expand existing ones but to add new encounter sets and then through quest cards use the Core Set encounter sets with the new ones.  If they expanded existing encounter sets it would change the difficulty they specify for the encounters of the rule books.\n\n\n\nThis is exactly what I'm picturing as well. It will be interesting to see the exact make-up of the adventure packs considering we're not going to get 3x of each card included like all the other LCG's. THere's no reason to have 3 of any hero or quest card for one adventure pack. I expect 3x of each player deck card, one of th ehero, the three quest cards, and then odd numbers of each encounter card to balance the difficulty of the encounter deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45574-will-expansion-packs-enhance-existing-encounter-decks/?do=findComment&comment=457229","commentId":457229,"userName":"alessandro5","timestamp":1303405518,"content":"I think that the packs are adding mew encounter decks.

Not sure if they will add any special rule for this, but would be very nice if they do. Since we will have more heroes of each sphere to choose from, maybe the possibility of bringing replacements for your defeated heroes from the same sphere for next quests?"}]}
