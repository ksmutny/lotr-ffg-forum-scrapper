But I don't see anything in the card that strictly forbids the return of a neutral card. The part about an ally belonging to any sphere is only a clarification to show that the card can be used to bring back a tactics ally, for example. The wording is that an ally can be from any sphere, not that is has to be from a sphere. It should not preclude the return of a neutral ally as neutral allies can be played by any sphere. Fortunately, I have not used this card too much to return Gandalf, so it won't be that much of a blow.\n\nThe one part that really annoys me is that this is a well known combo that players have been using from the beginning. Yet, FFG has not bothered to put out the clarification to stop this error. In fact, if the person who started this thread would not have been kind enough to share it here, those of us who don't go on that site, would never know.

At least not as far as I interpret the phase structure. This makes Aragorn slightly less powerful as he cannot be used in combo with unexpected courage to effectively take part in all the main phases of the game. I thought that this combo really suited him but the phases flow chart expressly states that actions are played after shadow cards are dealt to enemies, then all of combat is resolved, then actions can be played again after combat has fully been resolved.\n\nA bit off topic but I have to say that for this game to find a viable organized play niche FFG and the designers need to clarify alot of glaring rules inconsistencies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/?do=findComment&comment=526895","commentId":526895,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1315780440,"content":"The Strolling Bones said:\n\n flow chart expressly states that actions are played after shadow cards are dealt to enemies, then all of combat is resolved, then actions can be played again after combat has fully been resolved.\n\n\n\n \n\nI agree with a lot of your main points.  However, the rulebook explicitly states that actions may be played between combat phases, so by not allowing this you are restricting yourself needlessly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/?do=findComment&comment=526971","commentId":526971,"userName":"LovingAngel","timestamp":1315803413,"content":"dbeman said:\n\nIf it were an errata then the text on the card would have changed.

The card text reads \"Action: Choose an ally with a printed cost of X in any player's discard pile. Put that ally into play under your control.

All we got was the intended interpretation from the Lead Designer. However, it should become an official errata, because the card is indeed poorly worded and it does not readily forbid it's use to return neutral allies. The fact that, for months, the consensus on these forums was that it could, should prove that it is misleading. It simply asks for quite a leap of deduction to figure out that \"can belong to any sphere\" should also be interpreted as \"must belong to a sphere\".  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/?do=findComment&comment=549361","commentId":549361,"userName":"player728697","timestamp":1319997454,"content":"Dwnhmcntryboy said:\n\n \n\n As there are only 4 spheres of influence in the game and Gandalf does not belong to any sphere Stand and Fight is worded perfectly. It is less an errata and more clearfication. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the English language, parentheses are used to add supplementary information. When used correctly, a reader should be able to ignore material enclosed in parentheses without changing the logical meaning of the content. So, if there were somewhere in the rulebook that said you can only target ally cards in the discard pile if they belonged to a sphere of influence, then we would agree with you, but it does not say that.\n\nFurther, the word \"may\" is permissive, not preventative, so even without the parentheses, the language does not match the ruling.\n\nFinally, if the card had been printed with the anti-Gandalf intention in mind, the author would not have even needed to add the last sentence. Instead, it would read:\n\nAction: Choose a non-neutral ally with a printed cost of X in any player's discard pile. Put that ally into play under your control.\n\nSo regardless of whether you try to read it through strict interpretation of English or by the writer's intentions, you would reach the conclusion that neutral cards are permitted. Therefore, this ruling is in fact errata, not clarification.\n\nIncidentally, I'm very disappointed Fantasy Flight has not shown any willingness to offer corrections for their errors. This is not a CCG, so I see no excuse not to offer reprints. I have contacted them twice, using two different methods, a month apart, politely inquiring if they would print a correction for the Nazgul of Dol Guldur, and they have not even been polite enough to respond.\n\nTo contrast, Czech Games Edition, a much smaller company, mailed me a corrected card, with a less significant error, all the way from the Czech Republic.\n\nSo I am now boycotting all Fantasy Flight products, which has at least cost them a few hundred dollars in sales so far."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/?do=findComment&comment=549453","commentId":549453,"userName":"Dwnhmcntryboy","timestamp":1320016746,"content":" Meh I still play stand and fight with Gandalf until the FAQ comes out.

It's hard to understate how much the rules were cleared up by the global incorporation of the stack - the days before that of duelling interrupts (not instants) were terribly difficult to understand.

I would say the first point above is probably the most important one in understanding why they do not work quite the same.

Secon big set:Two towers  was awful and many players stop to play game cose of this.\n\nI hope they can fix every thing cose i love  the game and enjoy art of the cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/?do=findComment&comment=551007","commentId":551007,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1320284995,"content":"Svenn said:\n\nsilverhand77 said:\n\n \n\n\n \n\nThere are a couple major differences.\n\n1) Eleanor's effect is a \"Response\" and Thalin's ability is a constant effect.\n\n2) Eleanor's effect says to cancel the When Revealed specifically and then replace the card. Thalin's ability instantly destroys the card as it enters play.\n\n3) Eleanor's effect is on Treachery cards while Thalin's ability is on creatures.\n\nThey are definitely similar in that the end result is a card leaving play, but outside of that there are many reasons why these do not function the same. I would say the first point above is probably the most important one in understanding why they do not work quite the same. Maybe if Thalin's ability was \"Response: When Thalin is questing and a creature is revealed from the encounter deck, deal 1 damage to that creature.\" it would be a different case...\n\n\n\nI am aware of these differences, but I don't see how Thalin's ability being a constant effect changes anything about what happens to the keywords. The effects occur at the same time, because in order for Thalin's ability to happen, a card has to be revealed from the encounter deck. Once the card is revealed, the keyword triggers and Thalin's ability takes effect in the case of the crows, the creature dies and the keyword resolves.\n\nThalin's ability does not destroy the card, it kills the creature in the case of crows. I still have found any evidence to suggest that a card effect ceases to exist just because the card leaves play.  Eleanor's effect is not restricted just to treachery cards, there are also creatures with when revealed effects on them,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52971-stand-and-fight-gandalf-illegal-play/?do=findComment&comment=551012","commentId":551012,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1320286871,"content":"Although it is not clearly stated in the rules.

Once you kill the Witch King it is removed from the staging area thus, its ability ceases to be in effect. However a triggered ability such as a keyword only requires the card to be revealed to trigger and resolve. All I'm saying is that I can't find a ruling that says it is cancelled if the card bearing it  is discarded, and if the ruling on Eleanor is anything to go off, it would seem that keyword effects once triggered are independant of their source.

Fair enough, it seems to have worked well for Magic. But there it does not seem to be a stack. As far as I understand, it looks it works more like a queue of events and keywords (if we can make another computing analogy), which can then be interrupted by the resolution of various effects. According to the rules, we resolve \"When revealed\" first, then Doomed and Surge.\n\nThus, Thalin constant effect applies immediately after the card is revealed, thus may interrupt an enemy with only 1HP.\n\nEleanor does not, because she only cancels the \"When revealed\" part. So the card is revealed -> skip When revealed -> Doomed and Surge.\n\nI agree we could benefit greatly from a very precise, rigorous, definition of the sequence of events, especially where each effect/keyword takes place (e.g. if in sequence).

It seems strange because - a priori - a card is either revealed or not. What would be a real clarification would be to give a precise sequence of event resolution. It seems clear that they are resolved as a queue, which can be interrupted if a card is killed (Thalin and 1HP cards), or where some steps are simply skipped (Eleanor's ability). For instance, we could have: constant effects (when conditions are met)->actions->responses->forced effects (when conditions are met)->when revealed->doomed->guarded->surge. Now the authors would need to check that such a sequence is compatible with all the cards (at this stage, there are not that many, so it is feasible), but that would make everyone happy. But maybe I am too anal there? Because honestly, I have not encountered any problem so far, once Thalin and Eleanor's abilities have been clarified.\n\n "}]}
