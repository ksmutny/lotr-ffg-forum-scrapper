Switch that location with a location in the staging area. Shuffle the encounter deck.\n\nThe location from the staging area leaves play, but hasn't been explored or made active. As written, that means it doesn't trigger the grapple effect of being flipped. Since the grapple card is actingas an attachment it should thus be discarded when the thing it's attached to is gone.\n\nA rules lawyer looking for a soft game experience would thus discard the card.\n\nFairer responses would be to do a real switch and attach the grapple to new location. Or to have the Grapple keyword trigger when the location leaves play - regardless of why.\n\nI think the second one is the most likely result of an FAQ adjustment.\n\n \n\nEdited March 19, 2017 by RichardPlunkett"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/245183-grapple-keyword-vs-mariners-compass/?do=findComment&comment=2692712","commentId":2692712,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1489902198,"content":"> 59 minutes ago, RichardPlunkett said:\n> \n> A rules lawyer looking for a soft consistent and precise game experience would thus discard the card.\n> \n> Fairer More subjective responses would be to do a real switch and attach the grapple to new location.

Nevertheless we were able to save the storm caller. I hope this specific question is addressed in a new FAQ. I will also email Caleb in regards to it to find out for sure. thanks again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
