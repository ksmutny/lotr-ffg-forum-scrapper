No more than 3 progress can be placed on attached location each round.” If three or less progress tokens would fully explore the location that ‘Snowdrifts’ is attached to, so that the location is removed, would the additional progress carry over to the quest like normal? Or would one lose the carryover the same as if the progress added did not explore and eliminate the location with ‘Snowdrifts’ attached?\n\n \n\nThank You"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229484-the-road-darkens-%E2%80%98snowdrifts%E2%80%99/?do=findComment&comment=2402903","commentId":2402903,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1473211399,"content":"It'll carry over!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229484-the-road-darkens-%E2%80%98snowdrifts%E2%80%99/?do=findComment&comment=2404082","commentId":2404082,"userName":"autumnB","timestamp":1473272813,"content":"Thank you.
