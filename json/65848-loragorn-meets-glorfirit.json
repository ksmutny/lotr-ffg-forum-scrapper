Going back to some older quests with new decks can be quite a bit easier. Even Anduin isn't so terrifying with some new style decks. Personally I'm having huge trouble with WiW, but I think it's because a) I misread the tentacle cards, and didn't realise they are the attachment if they attach and b) the deck I tried with had no scrying, and wasn't killy enough to kill the Watcher. Not sure what my point was with that ramble…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65848-loragorn-meets-glorfirit/?do=findComment&comment=643564","commentId":643564,"userName":"Cotillion37","timestamp":1339504636,"content":"Why not just rename the original Glorfindel in to Corefindel?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65848-loragorn-meets-glorfirit/?do=findComment&comment=643582","commentId":643582,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1339508262,"content":"Cotillion37 said:\n\nWhy not just rename the original Glorfindel in to Corefindel?\n\n\n\nBrilliant!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65848-loragorn-meets-glorfirit/?do=findComment&comment=643594","commentId":643594,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1339510033,"content":"/grimace……………….lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65848-loragorn-meets-glorfirit/?do=findComment&comment=643612","commentId":643612,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1339512491,"content":"Cotillion37 said:\n\nWhy not just rename the original Glorfindel in to Corefindel?\n\n\n\n \n\nWinner."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65848-loragorn-meets-glorfirit/?do=findComment&comment=643669","commentId":643669,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1339521495,"content":" I like Lorefindel better for the core model."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65848-loragorn-meets-glorfirit/?do=findComment&comment=643702","commentId":643702,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1339526028,"content":"Bullroarer Took said:\n\n I like Lorefindel better for the core model.\n\n\n\nNew winner. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65848-loragorn-meets-glorfirit/?do=findComment&comment=643718","commentId":643718,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1339528683,"content":"Mattr0polis said:\n\nBullroarer Took said:\n\n \n\n I like Lorefindel better for the core model.\n\n \n\n \n\nNew winner. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]\n\n\n\n \n\nYup.  The beauty of \"Loragorn\" was that it didn't change the basic \"sound\" of his name.  Glorfirit or Spindel are vastly different sounding than Glorfindel.  Corefindel or Lorefindel keep the same basic phonetics.  Lorefindel has the same pattern of using the sphere.  Either sound great!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65848-loragorn-meets-glorfirit/?do=findComment&comment=643726","commentId":643726,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1339530972,"content":"Does that mean you like Sporifindel too?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65848-loragorn-meets-glorfirit/?do=findComment&comment=643861","commentId":643861,"userName":"Quit2","timestamp":1339563505,"content":"benhanses said:\n\nMattr0polis said:\n\n \n\nBullroarer Took said:\n\n \n\n I like Lorefindel better for the core model.\n\n \n\n \n\nNew winner. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYup.  The beauty of \"Loragorn\" was that it didn't change the basic \"sound\" of his name.  Glorfirit or Spindel are vastly different sounding than Glorfindel.  Corefindel or Lorefindel keep the same basic phonetics.  Lorefindel has the same pattern of using the sphere.  Either sound great!\n\n\n\nBased on what you say, Spirfindel should work for the new one.\n\nIn any case, it's better than Spindel or Glorfirit"}]}
