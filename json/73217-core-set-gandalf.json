It does NOT say that each deck can have only 1 copy of him in the deck, though. Can I put more than 1 (up to 3) copy of him in my deck? I'm getting real sick of that little wizard hiding deep down near the bottom of my deck every game!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73217-core-set-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=714118","commentId":714118,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1351030229,"content":"Yes, you can put any card (including Gandalf, by title) up to 3 copies in your deck when you build your won customized deck.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73217-core-set-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=714142","commentId":714142,"userName":"sammann11","timestamp":1351033427,"content":"Cool. Thanks for the confirmation. Just did that - and drew Gandalf on the second turn - and easily whupped Journey down the Anduin (Plus, the drawfrom the encounter deck seemed nice for once). No dead Heros, both hands finishing with a threat of 35 or less. Thanks Gandalf! (and Angus Lee!)"}]}
