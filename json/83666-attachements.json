Thus, for instance, a \"\"Spirit\" Hero could equip an Armour card just being activated by a \"Tactics\" Hero who gives the item to the \"Spirit\" Hero who could not spend Resources over that item. I'm playing according to a \"no borrowing\" rule, otherwise any Hero could just as well directly spend his/her own Resources over any Attachements, I'm still a little doubtful, anyway…Thanks for any advice.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83666-attachements/?do=findComment&comment=793953","commentId":793953,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1368163558,"content":"sure- as long as it doesnt say 'attatch to a tactics/ lore etc hero' then its fine\n\nand as long as all other requirements are met\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83666-attachements/?do=findComment&comment=2088090","commentId":2088090,"userName":"Paulohaka","timestamp":1457316673,"content":"Hi, i´m new to the game, and have some doubt about equipments.\n\n \n\nWell, on two players game, can a player equip an attachment on a hero of the other player?\n\n \n\nAnd when engaged on an enemy, at a new engagement fase, can the other player engage on a monster already engaged by other player? or the monster keeps engaged on always the same player?\n\n \n\ni think this is it =D"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83666-attachements/?do=findComment&comment=2088738","commentId":2088738,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1457362107,"content":"> 1.  Well, on two players game, can a player equip an attachment on a hero of the other player?\n> \n> \n> \n>  \n> \n> 2.  And when engaged on an enemy, at a new engagement fase, can the other player engage on a monster already engaged by other player? or the monster keeps engaged on always the same player?\n\n \n\n1.
