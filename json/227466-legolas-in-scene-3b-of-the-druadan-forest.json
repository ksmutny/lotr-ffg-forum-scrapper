Thank you cmabr002, no more doubts about the \"destroyed\" word. I consider this a full clear answer to my question.\n\n \n\nBut I still have doubt about destroyed/defeated to be fully synonymous. You say that in some circumstances (indistructible) you can defeat an enemy without destroying it.. how can they be fully synonymous?\n\n \n\nThe word defeat is also used for scenarios, and we can't think about destroying a scenario.\n\n \n\nIn Shadow and Flame the word defeat is not used, but the durin's bane is also indistructible and you can't destroy it but you can let him fall into the dark pit. I would call this defeat the enemy.\n\n \n\nSo when I said that i would have been worded Legolas with \"defeat\" is because I like to think about him as character who get satisfaction defeating an enemy without necessarily kill or destroying it.\n\nBut this is offtopic and simply my opinion,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227466-legolas-in-scene-3b-of-the-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=2363335","commentId":2363335,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1471084040,"content":"cmabr002 is saying that Defeated and Destroyed must mean the same thing, because if they didn't mean the same thing then you could Defeat an Indestructible enemy.
