Am I right to assume that since this occurs \"at the beginning of the quest phase\", I will not have the opportunity to commit a hero or character to the quest?\n\nÂ \n\nThe example I currently have in front of me is Thalin could commit to the quest and damage an enemy when revealed but I think he wont commit until after this card comes out so the opportunity for a \"free\" point of damage will be missed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238810-hunt-for-gollum-2b-specifics/?do=findComment&comment=2573165","commentId":2573165,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1483646814,"content":"Yes, this happens before characters are committed to the quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238810-hunt-for-gollum-2b-specifics/?do=findComment&comment=2574902","commentId":2574902,"userName":"Randyman","timestamp":1483732762,"content":"Thanks, Nathan !"}]}
