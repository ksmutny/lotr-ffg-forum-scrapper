We change teams between each scenario. We made a pairing so that the players does not meet twice (only two players meet twice).\n\nEach game was limited to 1:45. If the players win, they scored 5 points. The first winner team had 2 points bonus. Second team 1 point and third 0.5 points.\nThe losers must note the number of rounds and the stage if players have lost all their games.\n\nThe players were satisfied with the format.
