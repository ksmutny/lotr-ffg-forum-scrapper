Just running through the rules and have a couple of noob questions, I hope that is OK.\n\n \n\n1-\n\nI can see that to play a four player game you would need two core sets to get 4 trackers and more tokens but as there are 12 heroes and 4 player decks in one core set why, apart from these bits do we need two sets to play ?. \n\n \n\n2-\n\nRelated to the above really. I can see no mention of a \"different\" setup for either the solo or the 4 player game so do the card mechanics scale the game to the number of players or am I missing something.\n\n \n\nLooks like a great game and these Forums are REALLY helpful.\n\n \n\nCheers Guys N Gals"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46186-solo-and-4-player-game-setup/?do=findComment&comment=462791","commentId":462791,"userName":"weebaldy","timestamp":1304418080,"content":" Opps I dont know how this double posted, sorry, can the admins delete this one please"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46186-solo-and-4-player-game-setup/?do=findComment&comment=462792","commentId":462792,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1304418121,"content":"1) The reason it says two core sets is for a 4 player game with full size decks you would need two. You can play with 4 players with one core set and use the smaller 30 card decks\n\n2) Setup is the same no matter the players, its the amount of encounter deck cards that changes during the quest phase. 1 per player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46186-solo-and-4-player-game-setup/?do=findComment&comment=462820","commentId":462820,"userName":"weebaldy","timestamp":1304421154,"content":" Excellent  Toqamish, that males sense now\n\nCheers"}]}
