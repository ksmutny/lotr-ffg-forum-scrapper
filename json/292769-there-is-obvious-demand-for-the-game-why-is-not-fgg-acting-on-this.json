Been spending more time and money on this than anything else for the past few months. I'm hooked.\nIt is apparent howeverÂ that the game is hard to get a hold of. I'm from Scandinavia and I believe it could be even harder here than anywhere else - USA is far away, we don't have a local translation and we aint a lot of people.\nDuring my time with the game, I've not been able to grab a single big expansion until recently, when a medium sized online store for board games got a decently sized shipment from FGG.\nMountain of Fire, which they had about 20 of, sold out in 5 hours.\nLand of shadow, Treason of Saruman and On the Doorstep sold out in 1 day.\nBlack riders and Heirs of Numenor sold out in 3Â days.\nSeveral AP's were sold out in a few days as well.\n\nAnd now we're back to having close to no stock again. I bought most of the expansions mentioned above, so I ain't mad about missing out on those.\nI just think it is odd that FGG is not acting on the obvious demand for this game - are they purposefully choking the game out?\nThe fact that ebay auctions go for 2-4 times the original price, just hows how in-demand the products are, and it's not just in my country.\n\nIt is quite apparent to me that these products are still popular, even after 9-10 years - so congrats on making a successful game!\nBut what's up with most of the products being out of stock and barely getting reprinted? Especially the older exps and APs, those areÂ really hard to find. What is the goal here? Making us pay tripple prices through ebay won't give FGG any money.\n\nEdited March 25, 2019 by player4036658"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292769-there-is-obvious-demand-for-the-game-why-is-not-fgg-acting-on-this/?do=findComment&comment=3656912","commentId":3656912,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1553522906,"content":"I really don't know.

So sure, they could sell a lot of product if they prioritized our beloved LCG. But if printing new KeyForge decks is more profitable than LOTR reprints (news flash: newÂ anythingÂ is probably more profitable than reprints of almost any game; new stuff just draws in more players), then they certainly aren't making poor business decisions by not prioritizing reprints.\n\nNow, it would be nice if they could upgrade printer capacity to meet demand, so that they could do reprints in addition to the new stuff, but without seeing their finances and cash flow, it's hard to say categorically that they are making poor business decisions. It could very well be that the cost of acquiring new printing capacity (probably through new contracts with new Chinese manufacturers, with all of the timeÂ and money that making sure the new company matches up to existing standards implies) is more than could be recouped by a faster reprint schedule.\n\nAnother consideration is that FFG was just blindsided by the demand for the game. The recent reprints disappeared remarkably fast, and it could very well be that they are planning to increase the schedule moving forward since the demonstrated demand for the game is more than they expected."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292769-there-is-obvious-demand-for-the-game-why-is-not-fgg-acting-on-this/?do=findComment&comment=3657388","commentId":3657388,"userName":"player4036658","timestamp":1553545811,"content":"> 31 minutes ago, Onidsen said:\n> \n> it could very well be that they are planning to increase the schedule moving forward since the demonstrated demand for the game is more than they expected.\n\nI really hope so. Like you said, either printers running hot at all times or \"warehouse too full\" seems to be the only logical explanations here.\nI've yet to find aÂ Khazad Dum expansion for a reasonable price, soÂ would love to see that one being reprinted sometime.

I basically went into a frenzy, and I'm sure you could make a lot of Gollum/Precious parallels to my sudden purchasing habits of everything LOTR LCG. I guess I had always hoped to gradually expand my collection like I did with the first two cycles years ago.\n\nThe unique nature of a cooperative LCG sets it up for continuous growth. Even now, knowing how rarely it is made available, I have a list of people at my LGS who want me to demo the game with them.

The Fighter Pack I's (a critical expansion) were just reprinted after being out of stock for nearly a year if my memory serves. When the reprints hit, they sold out in less than 5 hours! And the game isn't dead on FFG's side either, It's getting the largest expansion in FFG history! So while I'm disappointed that I likely won't see The Dread Realm, The Steward's Fear, or Druadin Forest for months to years, I'm really happy with how well they've been doing with reprints this year!
