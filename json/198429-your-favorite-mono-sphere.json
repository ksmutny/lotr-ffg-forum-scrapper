It is obviously good in multiplayer, but I think it is also a great challenge in solo. Of all the colors my personal favorite is mono spirit.\n\nThe most important aspect of the game, to this day, is questing, and mono spirit absolutely crushes that part of the game. The pelargir shipwright alone makes mono spirit a questing beast. The second most important part of the game is threat level, which is basically your life as a player. Only blue can consistently lower threat, and most mono spirit decks can end the game with 0 threat if you want to. Lowering threat can enable secrecy, OHUH Gandalf, or the Palantir. Blue doesn't have as much variety as green, but you can still go in many different directions, including Rohan, Idrean location control, Caldara combo, Hobbit secrecy with OHUH Gandalf, Palantir support for multiplayer, and so on.\n\nMy second favorite mono color is green for the variety. The color really smashes at healing and card draw.\n\nMy third favorite is tactics for battle and/or siege quests (obviously) or for range/sentinel combat support in multiplayer. In that context Beregond proves why he finished so high in the hero voting.\n\nLast, but still amazing and fun, is Leadership. Purple has the least variety but the highest ceiling of power. In mono form it can seriously suffer from lack of healing and lack of threattach reduction, especially in solo. I am hoping that newer cards like reinforcements and blessings of the valar will allow purple to use valour bonus cards to expand the power and variety of mono purple decks. I think we just haven't had enough time to explore the possibilities yet.\n\nEdited January 10, 2016 by DukeWellington"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/198429-your-favorite-mono-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1981558","commentId":1981558,"userName":"DurinVoronwe","timestamp":1452435599,"content":"Tactic is the most funny, becouse all heroes with 2 wp or more needs to quest together with all wp allies (and those are very overcosted if they only quest).
