I treat glaucoma,  do minor surgical procedures, manage traumatic brain injury therapy, practice orthokeratology, have 10 employees , have to keep the federal and state government happy meeting all their regulations. I see about 45 patients a day,  get to the office by 645am every morning, rarely leave before 6 pm, then I get to go home, finish all my medical records, make sure the practices bills are paid, make sure any correspondence to referring doctors is done, keep on top on payroll , try to keep on on all my profession reading and continuing education,  and about 50 other things I am too tired to type out.   You see, if I had just a job, I'd likely work 40 hours like anyone, since I own and run a business, I have to do all that OTHER administrative stuff when I'm done seeing my patients.   \n\n \n\nOh, and I do prescribe glasses, but that's maybe 1/3 of my practice.  I add that since that's all you seem to think my profession is, but you are wildly incorrect.  As for the last pack, I had it on pre-order weeks before I decided  to sell my stuff.\n\n \n\nI am quite certain you know a lot more about LOTR LCG than I do.\n\n \n\nAs for my profession or the demands on my time, you are well off the mark. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126752-sadly-im-selling/?do=findComment&comment=1331350","commentId":1331350,"userName":"FetaCheese","timestamp":1415762764,"content":"I...I get up at 11 am and p-play League of Legends all day....~\n\n \n\nEdit: Sempai-Grandspleen has finally noticed me!\n\nEdited November 12, 2014 by FetaCheese"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126752-sadly-im-selling/?do=findComment&comment=1331380","commentId":1331380,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1415764744,"content":"I'll Like your post, FetaCheese.  I'll Like it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126752-sadly-im-selling/?do=findComment&comment=1331592","commentId":1331592,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1415785209,"content":"Strange how he just wanted us to know about the opportunity to buy off a whole collection and then suddenly had to defend himself regarding as to 1) why he sells the collection, 2) why he bought it in the first place and 3) why he is busy at work.\n\n \n\nI mean seriously guys, give him a break.
