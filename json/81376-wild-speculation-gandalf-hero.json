Here's why:\n\n1)  The lengthy explanation of the rules concerning the use of heroes and allies with the same title in the Heirs of Numenor insert. Admittedly, this could apply to any hero/ally with the same name -there were many in the second hobbit set- but who comes in and out of play more often then Gandalf?\n\n2) The set has a distinct Return of the King flavour to it. It features Pippin, we know, and frequently the news articles refer to Gondor's greatest heroes. With regard to the War of the Ring who is a greater hero of Gondor then Gandalf the White?\n\n3) Ending the cycle with appropriate scale. The last hero in a cycle is generally the biggest. Which character could possibly be more climatic then Gandalf?\n\n4) The Elven Rings. The final hero in the dwarrowdelf cycle was Elrond, of course, with the powerful Elven Ring Vilya. Maybe FFG are planning a kind of Elven Ring trilogy. Gandalf and Narya in Against the Shadow and Galadriel and Nenya at the end of the next cycle?\n\nProbably all nonsense of course, but just thought I'd open the discussion. What do people think?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81376-wild-speculation-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=778116","commentId":778116,"userName":"bollywongaloid","timestamp":1364289383,"content":"Hmmm interesting thought.  Having a Gandalf Hero would also stop people including him as an ally in every deck that they build (even though the old Sneak Attack-Gandalf -combo is still one of my favourite plays). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81376-wild-speculation-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=778129","commentId":778129,"userName":"NotAZombie","timestamp":1364292340,"content":"It would be interesting for sure, but I think Denethor is much more likely. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81376-wild-speculation-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=778149","commentId":778149,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1364297290,"content":"I believe we will never see Gandalf as a hero.\n\n \n\nFirst, because of his own nature in the tolkien stories, he is always showing and then disapearing….\n\n \n\nAnd that is a impossible to do with an hero (unless some \"game- breaking\" rule change);\n\n \n\nSecond, while i would like to see the ring Narya, I belive that there we are going to see this ring with Cirdan (his rightfull owner);\n\n \n\n \n\nAs to the final hero on Against the Shadow cycle, I believe we either will see another Denethor or Faramir…\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81376-wild-speculation-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=778246","commentId":778246,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1364313675,"content":"CJMatos said:\n\nI believe we will never see Gandalf as a hero.\n\nFirst, because of his own nature in the tolkien stories, he is always showing and then disapearing….\n\nAnd that is a impossible to do with an hero (unless some \"game- breaking\" rule change);\n\nSecond, while i would like to see the ring Narya, I belive that there we are going to see this ring with Cirdan (his rightfull owner);\n\nAs to the final hero on Against the Shadow cycle, I believe we either will see another Denethor or Faramir…\n\n\n\n \n\nI agree, Narya with Cirdan, please.\n\nAs to final hero, I don't think Denethor or Faramir, I expect Denethor earlier in the cycle (AP1, 2, or 3, I mean obviously not the one with Pippin, I forget which that is though), and Faramir in AP4.

I guess what gizlivadi said is true. I'm not sure of the exact time this cycle is set in, but it's obviously prior to the War of the Ring, meaning Gandalf is still very much grey. Having said that I do think we will see a Gandalf hero sooner or later, like bollywongaloid said, it would really shake up everyone's strategies. And when/if the fellowship saga expansion comes presumably we will receive shiny new versions of a lot of the fellowship members anyway. Which leaves the question of who it might be? Denethor I think is a safe choice, but maybe too obvious? I guess we will see.\n\nOn an unrelated note, I'd really like to see Aragorn get some attention this cycle. Don't get me wrong his existing two versions are great, but combat wise I'd really like to see him brought up to the standard of recent super heroes (Glorfindel, Bard.) Maybe not a new version, as we already have two, but maybe an attachment that would have specific benefit if played on him. Anduril?

Maybe I'm biased because of my love for the character, but I find it a bit frustrating to have a Gondor cycle, and have so many synergies for the Gondor trait that Aragorn can't be a part of. Especially now the new Steed of the Mark card can give any Gondor or Rohan Hero Core Aragorn's ability. In some way or form I'd love to see Thorongil represented, with a combat ability matching the best of the other heroes. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81376-wild-speculation-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=780575","commentId":780575,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1364917080,"content":"Kcall07 said:\n\nI understand how you feel.
