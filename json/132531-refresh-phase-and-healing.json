This way you also ready them almost immediately after using their ability leaving them ready for when it matters or for an emergency during staging etc.\n\nEdited January 20, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132531-refresh-phase-and-healing/?do=findComment&comment=1413752","commentId":1413752,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1421741730,"content":"You assume correctly that it is wrong; characters only ready once during the refresh phase.

In some quests you pretty much have to use healers during staging rather than after questing or after combat or your heroes will perish, at other times (most of the time really) it is safer to save healing for later in the turn to protect your healers from nasty effects."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132531-refresh-phase-and-healing/?do=findComment&comment=1413936","commentId":1413936,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1421759888,"content":"> you pretty much have to use healers during staging \n\nThere is no action-window to use healers during staging, as I understand it. Unless, for instance, an enemy makes an attack, at which point there are action-windows of the normal enemy-attack framework."}]}
