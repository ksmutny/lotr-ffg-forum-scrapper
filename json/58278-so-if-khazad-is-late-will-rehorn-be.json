Unless you play with 3+ players and prepare decks especially for each scenario your odds are long.

With good deckbuilding skills and with good play, you should be able to win solo most of the scenarios easily. And you will not need a perfect draw from your deck and/or encounter deck. Just play more and study the game. Of course, some scenarios will be still very hard, for example Dol Guldur or Return To Mirkwood are rated as very hard for solo players. But quests like Anduin, Carrock, Hunt, Marshes, Emyn Muil are beatable easily with one, same deck.\n\nBottom line: FFG needs to create both easy and hard quests. Right now they are doing good job judging from my solo experience. There are 5 easy quests and 4 hard quests. And the best one by far is Return To Mirkwood.
