I just started playing black riders and i'm wondering if i can use ability of 3rd adventure card to place tokens on active location. Also, in order to win (in any other scenario) do i have to satisfy victory conditions + place tokens on adventure card only or do i have to clear active location as well?\n\n \n\nAnd second one - do i have to do a hide test for a Black Rider revealed during setup? If the answer is yes, this quest is insane :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png] . \n\nEdited August 31, 2016 by Zura"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228980-active-location-and-black-riders/?do=findComment&comment=2393104","commentId":2393104,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1472648093,"content":"1) Active locations are in play.\n\n \n\n2) If the Black Rider had been \"revealed\" during setup, the hide test would trigger.  However, the card says to \"Add\" 1 Black Rider to the staging area.  Cards that are added are not revealed, and the \"when revealed\" text is ignored."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228980-active-location-and-black-riders/?do=findComment&comment=2393289","commentId":2393289,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1472656287,"content":">  Also, in order to win (in any other scenario) do i have to satisfy victory conditions + place tokens on adventure card only or do i have to clear active location as well?\n\n \n\nMost of the time, it is just whatever victory conditions + the tokens on the adventure card.  Some enemy cards will have conditions, such as you cannot win unless the card is in the Victory display.  "}]}
