Following catagories:\n\n1: Hardest standard quest to-date\n\n2: Hardest standard quest to-date progression-style\n\n3: Hardest Nightmare quest to-date\n\n4: Hardest Nightmare quest to-date progression-style\n\n \n\nFeel free to add some runners-up to any category you wish.\n\n \n\n \n\nFor me, I only play progression and have not yet touched Nightmare, so:\n\nCategory 2: (In order so-far) Battle of Laketown, Peril in Pelargir, Siege of Cair Andros (Honourable mention for Escape From Dol Guldur which was really hard but I only had a couple of goes before moving on).\n\n \n\nCurious in peoples thoughts :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/256699-hardest-quests-up-to-date/?do=findComment&comment=2937928","commentId":2937928,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1503163174,"content":"I think you'll have to break it up in terms of solo and multiplayer to get a sensible ranking. For instance, nightmare Blood of Gondor is not too difficult in solo, but in 4 player it becomes so insane it basically breaks.\n\nHere's my solo ranking:\n\n1: Hardest standard quest to-date\n\n * Escape from Dol Guldur\n\n2: Hardest standard quest to-date progression-style\n\n * Escape from Dol Guldur\n\n3: Hardest Nightmare quest to-date\n\n * Escape from Dol Guldur\n\n4: Hardest Nightmare quest to-date progression-style\n\n * Escape from Dol Guldur\n\nKinda boring isn't it? In solo, due to the captured hero, it's super hard to get anything above a 33% win rate. Any other quest, if you build specifically for it, can be beaten more consistently and with a wider variety of decks.\n\nI guess what would be more interesting is if I shared my #2 solo picks:\n\n1: 2nd Hardest standard quest to-date\n\n * Siege of Annuminas (Non-POD goes to The Battle of Carn Dum)\n\n2: 2nd Hardest standard quest to-date progression-style\n\n * Siege of Annuminas (Non-POD goes to The Battle of Carn Dum)\n\n3: 2nd Hardest Nightmare quest to-date\n\n * The Battle of the Five Armies\n\n4: 2nd Hardest Nightmare quest to-date progression-style\n\n * Return to Mirkwood\n\n \n\nFor multiplayer, there are too many variables to consider, like number of players and whether the decks are built to synergize or not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/256699-hardest-quests-up-to-date/?do=findComment&comment=2938080","commentId":2938080,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1503171156,"content":"As Seastan says Escape from Dol Guldur take it all.

I do use the house rule that I get to choose the captive hero (so a max win rate of 33% ) even with my mid-size cardpool Escape from Dol Guldur has become manageable. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/256699-hardest-quests-up-to-date/?do=findComment&comment=2962365","commentId":2962365,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1504193102,"content":"I admit I do not really go back to Escape from Dol Guldur (normal mode) with the full current card pool very often. I'm sure it's possible now with all our hero choices to build a deck that is not reliant on a specific captured hero. \n\nBut with a power deck (Outlands, Caldara, Elrond/Vilya) or the right gimmicky deck (traps) you can achieve an incredibly high win rate against Carn Dum. Escape from Dol Guldur offers much more resistance to being \"solved\".\n\nAgain, this is for solo. For 2 player and up Carn Dum is harder, no question.\n\nEdited August 31, 2017 by Seastan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/256699-hardest-quests-up-to-date/?do=findComment&comment=2962392","commentId":2962392,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1504194336,"content":"I've been playing LoTR LCG for 6 years and I've never beaten Dol Guldur solo.
