My inclination is the say you would not be able to gain any progress whatsoever as the location does not specify that you are able to bypass it (as other cards have). This seems in line with the new FAQ 1.27 as well. Just wanted to see what everyone else around here thought.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68984-second-deep-saf-location/?do=findComment&comment=672536","commentId":672536,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1344764022,"content":"Correct. If DB isn't damaged, those progress tokens just fizzle. It's similar to the effects on Twisting Passage (TLD) and Perilous Swamp (TWitW) in that regard. \n\nTravel with caution."}]}
