Game over.\n\n \n\nBut I know what you meant  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] , so let's actually answer your question.\n\n \n\n> ... and put Long Defeat on the fists stage, will response trigger before second stage is in effect, so using its effect to heal Wilyador will not make Long Defeat discarded from play? Or it get discarded?\n\n \nWhen you fulfill a quest card's conditions (usually by placing enough progress on it, and sometimes by accomplishing other tasks as well), you progress immediately to the next stage of the quest. Any \"After\" effects, like Long Defeat (\"After attached quest card is defeated ...\") will resolve once you've finished setting out the new card (and fulfilling its \"When Revealed\" effect, if any).\n \nTherefore, if you use The Long Defeat's ability to heal Wilyador, it will be removed from the game (not just discarded) because by the time it triggers, stage 2's effect is in play. It's still a good idea, though -- five points of healing is like getting a free Athelas."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229064-long-defeat-on-first-stage-of-journey-to-rhosgobel/?do=findComment&comment=2394521","commentId":2394521,"userName":"DarkPhoenix","timestamp":1472732802,"content":"Is see.
