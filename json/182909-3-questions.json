If I declare Gondorian Spearman the defender and use his response of 1 damage to the attacking enemy which in this case kills it does the shadow card get discarded without reveal?\n\n \n\n2. Can I play allies onto another player?\n\n \n\n3. Can I play swift strike when another player declares a character as a defender to attack that players attacking enemy?\n\n \n\nThanks,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182909-3-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1698433","commentId":1698433,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1437428577,"content":"1 - Simply... Yes... By killing the enemy before the phase where you reveal shadow cards, that shadow card isn't revealed.\n\n \n\n2 - No... You can't play an ally and give him to other player....

I think that to be able to use this event, the defending character must be controlled by the player who plays the event."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182909-3-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1698443","commentId":1698443,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1437429301,"content":"You can use swift strike when someone else is defending.  It just says \"after a character is declared as a defender...\"  Some other cards (like Quick Strike, for example) include \"a character you control...\" or something like that.\n\nEdited July 20, 2015 by Teamjimby"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182909-3-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1698449","commentId":1698449,"userName":"Dsbessie","timestamp":1437429616,"content":"Thanks guys.
