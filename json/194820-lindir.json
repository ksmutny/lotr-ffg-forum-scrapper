Even in a full-power Erestor deck, I rarely get down to 1 or 2 cards during the planning phase. The cost is a little much for the stats alone.

One of them is Lindir. You play two of them, then play Lindir (thus you have played three) and draw three more card to have at your hand for the rest of the round. It does seem good to me at least"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194820-lindir/?do=findComment&comment=1915447","commentId":1915447,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1449036779,"content":"He feels to me more like an outside-of-Erestor card.
