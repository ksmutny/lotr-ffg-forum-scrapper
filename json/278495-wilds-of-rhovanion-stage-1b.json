Of course, that probably means your threat grows, but that's the balancing act."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278495-wilds-of-rhovanion-stage-1b/?do=findComment&comment=3389284","commentId":3389284,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1530238031,"content":"That's why Side Quests are great in this quest (I assume you're talking about Journey up the Anduin)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278495-wilds-of-rhovanion-stage-1b/?do=findComment&comment=3395322","commentId":3395322,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1530804354,"content":"Keep in mind that you progress any time you meet a quest stages criteria for moving forward so with ten or more progress on Stage 1 so long as you can kill any enemies that are from the evil creatures deck during combat you will immediately progress.
