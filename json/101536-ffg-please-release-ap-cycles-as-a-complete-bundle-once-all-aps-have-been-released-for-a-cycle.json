I'm guessing the MSRP for something like that would be around $100, but it would be absolutely WORTH IT to me, plus it would give new players coming into the game a new entry point that didn't require hunting the Interwebz to find expansions when they go out of print.\n\nEdited March 17, 2014 by FeloniusBard"}]}
