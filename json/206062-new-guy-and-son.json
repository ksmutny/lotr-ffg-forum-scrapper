Of Course you can to that by just using Cards released t that time (bulding decks with this specifics iss easy when you use an online deck builder that only Shows the Cards of specific packs), but for me me it was always sure I wouldn't have the discipline to go back and put all These new shiny Cards back^^\n\n \n\nShould you not care about Progression style I see Options: Start the Hobbit Saga, the Lotr Saga (what brings you campaign mode, Feelings about that mode are mixed I would say, personally I love it), pick up the mirkwood APs or get Khazad-Dum (this and the cycle work VERY well with both Hobbit boxes).\n\n \n\nIn my opinion you should NOT get anything from heirs of numenor, isengard and so on. The game got harder with the time and only having core + a later Expansion can easily cause Trouble."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206062-new-guy-and-son/?do=findComment&comment=2113752","commentId":2113752,"userName":"WillisRBC","timestamp":1458481881,"content":"Will I need a copy of everything for each player?

The Battle of Five Armies quest will probably be pretty difficult, but the rest of them should be pretty doable with a little elbow grease. The first Hobbit box has a lot of really good staple cards in it that form a good basis for a collection.\n\n \n\nYou might consider looking for a copy of the Across the Ettenmoors Adventure Pack too. You won't be able to play the quest yet (because it requires cards from the Lost Realm Deluxe pack) but the hero, Dori, would fit in well with the card pool you'd have with Hobbit + Core. He was really lambasted when he came out because he was already outclassed by some of the cards from a different expansion, but if he had come out earlier in the game's life (with the Hobbit boxes, for instance) I think he would have been really well received.\n\n \n\nAnyway, I think you'll be fine. Some of the quests will be hard, but there's fun to be had from that too!
