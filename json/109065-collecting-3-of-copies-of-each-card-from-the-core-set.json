People say they don't need multiple copies of core but many people do. I would say to truly get the most out of the game you need 2 copies and 3 if your a serious player.\n\nIf you proxy or whatever there are some great cards in core you want 3 off. Not a few but tons and not just UC or CStone. Things like test of will, gleowine.. Well, I'd be listing half the set before I'm done. The funny thing is many will say that you do not need but they themselves will own at least 2 and proxy for 3.\n\nThe good news is that as the game is older now there is a pretty steady stream of reselling going on. Keep an eye on BGG auctions, Card Game DB trades and eBay. You can usually grab a full copy of core for less than the price of a single Asylum Pack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109065-collecting-3-of-copies-of-each-card-from-the-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=1128121","commentId":1128121,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1403309419,"content":"I would encourage you to not buy extra copies.  If you are going to play with more than 2 people, then obviously get an extra set.  Otherwise, having extra copies of all the powerful cards like Unexpected Courage only restricts your deck building.  You will find that half of your deck is comprised of those same powerful cards that you would include in every deck.  If you only buy one core set, you have to fill in a lot more cards and it lets you use a wider variety of cards.\n\n \n\nIf this was a competitive game you would have to buy 3 sets.  The beauty of the co-op aspect is that having only 1 set just makes the game a little more challenging, which is a good thing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109065-collecting-3-of-copies-of-each-card-from-the-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=1128367","commentId":1128367,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1403337689,"content":"> Is there a way to collect 3 copies of every card from the core set without having to buy 3 core sets?
