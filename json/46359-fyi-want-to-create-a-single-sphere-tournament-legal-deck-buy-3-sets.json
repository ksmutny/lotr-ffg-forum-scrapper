With two sets and the first AP you might end up with one tournament-legal deck for each sphere:\n\nThe first AP would have to include three cards for Tactics and two cards for each of the other Spheres.\n\nMaybe I'll eventually get a second set - the price isn't too bad for 51 additional cards. But first I'd have to find someone to play regularly with, because solo play sucks (at least using a single deck)."}]}
