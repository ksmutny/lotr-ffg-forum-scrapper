The Black Riders looks fun, though. I have one question: Is it possible to play it with 2 players or more? Who takes control of Frodo? I'm thinking, since there is a limited number of hobbit heroes, that if 4 players want to take part, they all have to settle with one hero each. Is this correct? Thanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99550-the-black-riders-multiplayer/?do=findComment&comment=988300","commentId":988300,"userName":"Spurries","timestamp":1392734852,"content":"First Player gains control of Frodo.  Right, all players cant play all Hobbits, as there were not 17 Hobbits.  You do not have to only play with Hobbits, any hero is eligible. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99550-the-black-riders-multiplayer/?do=findComment&comment=988335","commentId":988335,"userName":"koriakin97","timestamp":1392736796,"content":"I played it two-player, it's fun and thematic with one player controling Sam, Merry and Pippin, and the other Glorfindel, Aragorn and Fatty.

Taking your initial one as an example: LotR LCG is designed to be a 1-4 player co-operative experience and every their product since the release never, never limited the amount of players, and it never will. Even more, Black Riders expansions introduces a Peril keyword which makes sense only in a multiplayer game. Just try to use common sense sometimes, it works wonders."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99550-the-black-riders-multiplayer/?do=findComment&comment=989313","commentId":989313,"userName":"Spurries","timestamp":1392820131,"content":"In this case I agree, reading the rulebooks is a good idea before coming to the forums."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99550-the-black-riders-multiplayer/?do=findComment&comment=991462","commentId":991462,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1392995417,"content":"Yeah but there's no need to go out of your way to make the guy feel bad. \nThese forums have a bad enough reputation as it is for being rude to people.\n\nLet's try to change this!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99550-the-black-riders-multiplayer/?do=findComment&comment=991474","commentId":991474,"userName":"KennedyHawk2","timestamp":1392996323,"content":"> Ah, I didn't know other heroes are allowed!
