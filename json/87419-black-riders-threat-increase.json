You dont need to rise your threat tis time.  \n\nI see like you have a pile of the dead hero and you must add to your starting threat + number of heroes in your dead pile.\n\n+ 1 if you just a change a hero. So is quite easy actually.\n\nI do it now with my own compaign through all Hobbits quests using  cards include a heroes only from the Core set and both Hobbits expansion. I lost Beorn on the first quest so my starting threat is up to 1.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87419-black-riders-threat-increase/?do=findComment&comment=827089","commentId":827089,"userName":"Alex6222","timestamp":1375225251,"content":"Thanks for the reply Glaurung, i think this will be a very good expansion. By the way if you are playing solo in your hobbit campaign try using thorin, ori and oin it´s quite powerful and i have beaten the 6 quests with the same heroes and without loosing any of them (although i did use cards from other expansions)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87419-black-riders-threat-increase/?do=findComment&comment=1869107","commentId":1869107,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1446069550,"content":"> 2.
