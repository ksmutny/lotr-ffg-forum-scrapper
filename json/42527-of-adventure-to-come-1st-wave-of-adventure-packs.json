In the example of the key, this gets added to the encounter deck, so as you collect \"all\" the cards that match the symbols on the first quest card, to prevent dilution problems with the key card, they can't really provide new cards that add to the quest deck going foward.\n\n2. I did think the the orc/goblin encounter cards (The chieftain and Dol Guldor orcs) are examples of those, could be used in a couple of the initial quests (and this still could be the case) including the final adventure in the tower itself, but as the magical stream also has that same icon (a goblins head) and it makes no sense to encounter a stream in a tower, that might not be the case, and so each card may only be used with one specific quest?\n\n3. The description of the expansion packs also says that the encounter cards are \"devoted\" to the quest. Doesn't neccessarily prevent them being used with other quests from other expansions or the core set, but again they'd need to deal with the card dilution issue somewhere.\n\nThe upside of this is that they can make the encounter deck very thematic and really match the quest being played but the downside is that you might get several cards that are effectively the same, but linked to different quests.\n\nI certainly think some cards can be used in more than one quest, even if just from the core set, as otherwise why would they give each quest several different symbols - if the quest had its only set of cards that were only ever used in that quest, they'd only ever be the need for one symbol per quest.\n\nOnly time will tell, and perhaps we'll get something in between - perhaps a x number of you orc icon encounter cards and add to the quest deck rather than \"all\"...? So that they can add cards with the same icon within expansions without causing any card dilution issues\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42527-of-adventure-to-come-1st-wave-of-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=432664","commentId":432664,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1299163797,"content":"TheDukester said:\n\nIt seems odd in the extreme to even think about expansion packs before there's any real evidence that the core set actually exists.\n\n\n\nI can't tell about the English version, but the German version of the core set definitely exists!

So the Carrock expansion will have it's special set of Carrock encounter cards but will then probably include the \"Wilderlands\" set and maybe the \"Dol Guldur Orcs\" set. It seems like each scenarios specific card are only used for that scenario but then, as said above, will include cards from the broader pool of badguys."}]}
