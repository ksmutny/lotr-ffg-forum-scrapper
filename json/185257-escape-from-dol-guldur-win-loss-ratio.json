All three defeats were very close calls (I lost the last one for 1 missing progress marker on the last stage), with the Nazgul being defeated every time, yet still I'm not happy. I found out the problem in the deck (not enough drawing cards so that it happens that at stage 3 I have plenty of resources but no cards in hand) and possibly fixed it by adding Ancient Mathom to the mix (I'm using 2x core sets and cards from the first cycle only, and I won't change this until I have 200 plays done), but this made me wonder about what makes you happy with this scenario\n\n \n\nThanks in advance for stories shared and comments :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nJULIA"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185257-escape-from-dol-guldur-win-loss-ratio/?do=findComment&comment=1738239","commentId":1738239,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1439724435,"content":"I'm probably going to be frowned upon for this, but I consider this scenario extremely poorly balanced. It's tough as nails to beat solo, but it's a simple cakewalk with more players.

The main problem is that I don't want help with my decks (unless I specifically ask for it): half of the fun of the game is learning the cards and what you can do with them, and reading comments like \"you should add this or that card\" kills the fun of discovery out of it. Not that I don't appreciate the knowledge, the skills and the willingness to help, but I like learning the hard way (but if anyone wants my deck, just PM me)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185257-escape-from-dol-guldur-win-loss-ratio/?do=findComment&comment=1746767","commentId":1746767,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1440110523,"content":"Played one more tonight, with Celeborn imprisoned. Opening turn seemed to be a disaster: I tried to push on progressing to stage 2 immediately, with Thalin, Eowyn, Elrond and Glorfy questing. Found Ungoliant Spawn as first revealed card, and Mountains of Mirkwood. Ugh. 0 progress markers placed on round 1, and Ungoliant Spawn arriving. Moving from stage 1 to stage 2 required some sort of eternity, and I managed to survive due to the Spawn being Forest-snared, and a couple of Feint played at the right time. Still, even with Thalin defeated during Stage 2, I passed to Stage 3 thanks to Legolas with Unexpected Courage and a double Blade of Gondolin. Last round I had the Nazgul engaged on the Lore / Spirit side, with 4 damages on him. Dawn take you all was enough to vanquish the riskier part of his attack, so that Northern Tracker took one for the group, and then Glorfy, Legolas and Horseback Archer finished off the guy, winning a game that seemed to be lost for how it had began.\n\n \n\nSo far 10 games played, 7 victories, 3 defeats at Dol-Guldur. Time to move to the next one :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185257-escape-from-dol-guldur-win-loss-ratio/?do=findComment&comment=1747887","commentId":1747887,"userName":"ppsantos","timestamp":1440174907,"content":"Using a single Core Set Spirit and Leadership 30-card starter decks, my brother and I played this tonite and won, on our first time to play as 2 players (we've played EFDG individually several times already).  I was surprised to see that we did not have much difficulty.  Did we get lucky, on our first attempt?"}]}
