Same number of stats and similar ability. Minstrel's willpower could actually be used every turn vs Forge-man whose ability is used every round and the 1 defense is practically useless even if you don't use his ability.\n\n \n\nIn general though, regardless of ability (even with the new Silvan cards who get the boost for a turn), number of stat points = cost x 2 with a potential to have + or - 1 stat point. There are enough exceptions though, that I'm not horribly bothered by it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112619-trouble-in-tharbad-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1187688","commentId":1187688,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1407431082,"content":"Nothing will beat Erebor Hammersmith.
