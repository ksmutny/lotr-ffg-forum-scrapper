Played first quest in the core set with only cards from it. I got some very lucky cards do and was curious what other players have gotten as their best setup hands without pulling a Mulligan. My cards where: 2 Gandalf, 1 The favor of the lady, 1 Celebrians Stone, 1 The Galadhrims Greeting, 1 sneak attack. After a couple off rounds i got another sneak attack and ended the Passage through Mirkwood scenario on 7threat ( really good for me, last time i won that scenario i had a threat in the 30s). I was playing with Theodred, Aragorn and Eowyn as my heroes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59820-best-setup-hand/?do=findComment&comment=587855","commentId":587855,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1328026538,"content":"Aggrak said:\n\nHi everone, new to this game having only owned and played it for about 2 weeks now.

I would have traded that Favor for A Test of Will anytime however (other nice replacements would have included Northern Tracker, Steward of Gondor and Unexpect Courage).\n\nI don't always like having 2 Gandalf to start with, especialy with your Sneak Attack. You'll rarely have enough resources to play 2 Gandalf back to back (at least, without having Steward of Gondor out) anyway, so it's better to draw them 2 turns apart (but hey, it beats not seeing the old geezer for a whole game!)"}]}
