Old Tom has to be around at the end of the round for his Forced effect to \"go off.\" The Brood's forced effect \"goes off\" when it engages.\n\n \n\nIt's not the \"Forced\" keyword itself that determines when the ability happens - the \"forced\" keyword simply \"forces\" you to trigger the ability when the ability itself specifies (at engagement, during questing, end of round, etc).\n\n \n\nin other words, different \"forced\" effects \"go off\" at different times in the game - one at the engagement step, one at the end of the round.\n\nEdited March 20, 2014 by Dain Ironfoot"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101809-ungoliants-brood/?do=findComment&comment=1020095","commentId":1020095,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1395338511,"content":"from the Core Set Rulebook:\n\n \n\nForced effects are initiated by specific occurrences throughout a game, and they occur automatically, whether the card’s controller wants them to or not.
