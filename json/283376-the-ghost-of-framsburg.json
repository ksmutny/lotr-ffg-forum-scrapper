compared to Beregond. Especially if no tactic access is available to gondorian shield him. Dain is more flexible too as he can attack for 2 when needed. And yes, defend for 6 out of the gate at the cost of something (discarding) which could turn into an upside you  build around it. However the cost of repetebly  discarding can be taxing on the long run. At least he is in spirit so I guess it means includong will of the West x 2/3 copies to counter the card trashing. I cannot wait to try him in a deck and see what he bring on the table.

Most builds don't drill down through the entire deck, right? There's often a good number of cards not drawn even at the end of a quest.\n\nSo, those (randomly chosen!) cards are in a sense no more useful to you than those discarded through mining. And in a mining deck, you are presumably getting some positive use out of the mining, e.g., boosting Spirit Dain's defense and/or hitting a Hidden Cache, so overall you shouldn't really worry about it that much\n\nAs ever, things are much more nuanced than the short summary, but I think the principle that mined cards are generally no worse than undrawn cards is good to keep in mind. Once you're mining way more cards than you would have had undrawn (which Dain might facilitate), the calculus starts to get complicated…\n\nEdited September 25, 2018 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283376-the-ghost-of-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3483036","commentId":3483036,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1537887659,"content":"> 1 hour ago, sappidus said:\n> \n> To expand on @player1683311 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/189558-player1683311/]'s point: I question whether Valiant Determination is worth playing in the situation where all you get out of it is 2 WP.

Dain's ability is available right from the start of the game without needing anything else in play. As far as the risk of losing useful cards, how often do you draw your entire deck in the course of a game? Because until you empty your deck those cards you discarded could just as easily have been the ones on the bottom of your deck which you just never drew. You don't get them either way. Except since Spirit also has cards like Dwarven Tomb and Stand and Fight, you can potentially pick the ones you want out of your discard pile, and this ends up being a lot easier than trying to actually draw all of them into your hand."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283376-the-ghost-of-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3483052","commentId":3483052,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1537888188,"content":"Thank you both ...
