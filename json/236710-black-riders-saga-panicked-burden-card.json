When I reveal this card, is my turn immediately ended? And what about my next turn? because all my characters are still exhausted. this would implicate that I will have difficulties to quest and fight this turn. Is this the correct resolution of this card?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236710-black-riders-saga-panicked-burden-card/?do=findComment&comment=2536620","commentId":2536620,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1481456151,"content":"The card just passes the first player token, it doesn't end the turn or do anything else. In a solo game, the next player doesn't exist so the first player token stays where it is. You just add 3 to your threat and carry on. In a multiplayer game, you just pass the token to the next player, they formally become the first player, and the turn carries on as normal."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236710-black-riders-saga-panicked-burden-card/?do=findComment&comment=2536743","commentId":2536743,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1481470505,"content":"There's even a player card called Follow Me! which moves the first player token.
