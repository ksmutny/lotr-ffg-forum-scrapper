(Cannot be cancelled.) Counts as a Condition attachment with the text: \"Attached hero cannot attack, defend, commit to a quest, trigger its effect, or collect resources.\"\n\nShadow: If attacking ennemy is a troll, resolve this card's \"when revealed\" effect.\n\n \n\n2 questions (basically, how would you rule it):\n\n- If Sacked! is revealed as a shadow card, can you cancel it with Hasty Stroke? The \"treachery\" portion (regular when revealed effect) can't be cancelled (no Eleanor nor A Test of Will), but the \"shadow\" needs to resolve first before you resolve the top portion of the card (\"when revealed\"). I'd rule that you can use Hasty Stroke to cancel it.\n\n- How would you resolve it if all heroes controlled by the first player already have Sacked! cards attached to them? Simply discard the just revealed card?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51029-sacked-faq-required-spoiler-for-catc/?do=findComment&comment=509634","commentId":509634,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1312575619,"content":"SiCK_Boy said:\n\n- How would you resolve it if all heroes controlled by the first player already have Sacked! cards attached to them?

You shouldn't be resolving anything but the shadow effect portion of any card that is revealed as a shadow card, unless some other effect specifies that you should. In that case, the can't be canceled portion never even comes into play here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51029-sacked-faq-required-spoiler-for-catc/?do=findComment&comment=510360","commentId":510360,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1312715013,"content":"The Shadow effect itself specifies it.

Following the strict order of things... the \"can't be canceled\" is part of the When Revealed, which doesn't take effect until the Shadow Effect resolves in this case. If the Shadow Effect is canceled then the When Revealed portion never comes into play, including the uncancelable portion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51029-sacked-faq-required-spoiler-for-catc/?do=findComment&comment=595872","commentId":595872,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1329612444,"content":" New question for \"Sacked!\": Does the \"(Cannot be cancelled).\" refer to the whole card?
