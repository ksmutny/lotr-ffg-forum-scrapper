For building the encounter deck , there is a mismatch between the information sheet and the quest cards.  The info sheet says to build the encounter deck with Fell Beasts, Lost in Wilderland and Hills of Wilderland, the quest cards all show the symbols for Fell Beasts, Gathering Gloom and Hills of Wilderland. I am assuming the sheet is correct - but does anyone know for sure?\n\nEdited October 23, 2018 by Boromore"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285020-roam-across-the-encounter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=3512220","commentId":3512220,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1540306848,"content":"This has happened before twice in the Dwarrowdelf cycle.

He also have the unique symbol in french. Some cards are fixed with the translation. What is a little bit sad is that sometime foreign version come out on the same time that the english version, with some correction. I understand that english cards were probably printed before the error was mentioned. But it could be better for us that FFG ask for translation before printing the products, so they can have a feedback."}]}
