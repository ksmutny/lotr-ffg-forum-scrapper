You can put what you'd like to see and/or what you expect seeing.\n\nI'd like something like this:\n\nBoromir\n\nLeadership Sphere\n\nGondor, Noble, Warrior\n\nThreat Cost 11\n\nWill Power 1\n\nAttack 3\n\nDefense 2\n\nHit Points 5\n\nBoromir can be assigned as a defender to any number of engaged enemies.\n\nIf you attach Horn of Gondor to Boromir, he gains a Tactics resource icon.\n\nI realize it seems quite too strong but I'd like that. It would give Horn of Gondor a much better use, as it is sort of weak right now. I'll be happy if Boromir is Leadership and not Tactics, it makes more sense to me when you already have Theodred and Faramir in the sphere, as opposed to having Legolas and Gimli in the Tactics.\n\nPS I expect something different although all the (5) numbers are hard to imagine differently. And the defending thing is quite thematic, I believe."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48060-boromir/?do=findComment&comment=482151","commentId":482151,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1307514491,"content":"I'd make him Tactics, with gaining a Leadership icon once he gets the Horn of Gondor (so that you can logically play him and the Horn in the same deck).\n\nMake him able to block an additional ennemy instead, if you think he's currently too strong.

He'd be able to produce the resource for which he'd play the Horn and then gain the Leadership icon. My way would require to have a Tactics hero already - not great. Thematicaly though, I find it more fit that he'd be Leadership and Horn would grant Tactics. But I think they will use neither, it will make Aragorn's ability less special perhaps. Although he may seem too strong compared to others now - and the cost does not really drawback too much.\n\nTo ready after attack is also a nice idea. Blocking more than 1 enemy is again very thematic perhaps but in playing terms it could mean a probable death."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48060-boromir/?do=findComment&comment=482182","commentId":482182,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1307519441,"content":"ClydeCloggie said:\n\n \n\nIf it is Boromir, I agree he should be a Tactics hero as his Horn is in Tactics as well.\n\nBut the 'dramatic scene' of Boromir's death is actually not in Fellowship but in Two Towers, unless FFG have messed up in their description and were thinking of the movies...\n\n \n\n \n\nHis death yes but the dramatic scene with Frodo is indeed at the end of the Fellowship.\n\nThey may have got confused though by the film experience.\n\nI really cannot think of another character (that has not been published yet) that would fit their description.

Other than Pippin's stupidity and Merry's cleverness in Moria, there's not too much dramatic stuff going on with either of the three in Fellowship; for them it all happens later. So Boromir does seem like the best bet. For me, the most dramatic scene of Fellowship is with the river horses where Glorfindel conjures up white horses from the river to stop the Nazgul from crossing. in MECCG, Gandalf got the credits with the Wizard's River-horses card, in the films it was Arwen, and of course we've already got Glorfindel in this game.
