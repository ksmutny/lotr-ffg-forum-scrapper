The wording caused this issue a bit,.because it is not exactly the same like say Abandoned Tools or Legolas but also not very different either. Thus I took the privilige of asking you guys for answers.\n\nThanks for any help!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125050-nm-into-the-pit-goblin-ambush-2b/?do=findComment&comment=1303849","commentId":1303849,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1413635882,"content":"Nobody any thoughts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125050-nm-into-the-pit-goblin-ambush-2b/?do=findComment&comment=1304188","commentId":1304188,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1413681452,"content":"\"Forced: After an enemy is defeated, place 1 progress on this stage.
