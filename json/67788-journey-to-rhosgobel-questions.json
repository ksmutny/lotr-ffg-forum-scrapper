The first player gains control of the eagle the moment he comes into play ( aka from the start on ). He changes control with the first player token.\n\n2. No you cannot move them. It the hero dies they are discarded.\n\n3. Yes, Glorfindel must be removed, too.\n\nUnder \"support\" on the FFG website for Lotr LCG you can look at the rules that come with this quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67788-journey-to-rhosgobel-questions/?do=findComment&comment=661372","commentId":661372,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1342777894,"content":" \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAtraangelis said:\n\n \n\nHello, Have a few questions concerning this adventure…\n\n \n\nThe Objective/ally Eagle at the beginning (wylador??)

Wilyador will start the game under the control of the first player, once you enact Quest 1A.\n\n2. the Athelas will be discarded (ie go to the encounter discard pile). I *think* this is correct but I can't actually find a direct reference in the rules/FAQ. My reading is that it becomes an attachment on the hero under his control. Therefore, hero death means this is discarded, and because it is an encounter card, it goes to the encounter discard pile. You certainly can't move them to another hero.\n\n3. Yes, this will apply to a hero as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67788-journey-to-rhosgobel-questions/?do=findComment&comment=661376","commentId":661376,"userName":"Atraangelis","timestamp":1342778543,"content":"Thank you both,\n\nI have to replay this then ,\n\nI did 2 and 3 wrong, Seems harsh though for Glorfindel… owch.\n\n \n\nPublish [../../../edge_public/img_edge/spacer.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67788-journey-to-rhosgobel-questions/?do=findComment&comment=661379","commentId":661379,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1342779291,"content":" Yes, it is rather harsh on Glorfindel."}]}
