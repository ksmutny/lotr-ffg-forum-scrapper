Characters always exhaust to defend unless otherwise specified, so Bilbo must exhaust to defend against Gollum. If Bilbo is exhausted, he must take an undefended attack (which will probably end the game).\n\nBasically, don't fail two riddles in the same turn. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69995-hobbit-3-defending-against-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=683706","commentId":683706,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1346153545,"content":"Yeah!\n\nI do think we have to exhaust him to defend and that he can take an undefended attack…\n\nMan, I'm having a hard time getting through this without Bilbo dying!\n\nI think a tri-sphere deck is probably not the best against the riddles…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69995-hobbit-3-defending-against-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=683788","commentId":683788,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1346159888,"content":"It certainly makes things easier to use a one- or two-sphere build, since many of the riddles involve naming a sphere (note that you cannot name \"neutral\").

(Thematically, I assume there isn't…)\n\n\n\nIt's a bit unclear. Caleb Grace of FFG has said that \"players can take actions when answering a riddle,\" but the only example in the Hobbit rules insert involves taking an action AFTER revealing riddle cards. Based on that example, I'd be inclined to say that you can't take actions between shuffling and revealing, but I haven't seen anything definitive. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69995-hobbit-3-defending-against-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=686715","commentId":686715,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1346622873,"content":" It seems pretty clear you are supposed to guess and not use Stargazer et al.\n\nIt's a brutal quest, but one of their best IMO.  I am wondering if we will see some mechanic like this for escaping the Elven King's halls."}]}
