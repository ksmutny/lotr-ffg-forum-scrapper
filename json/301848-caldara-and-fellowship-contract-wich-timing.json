You pay the cost for Caldara's ability (discarding Caldara). [You can do this because the ability has the potential to change the game state, which is assessed independent of the fact that Fellowship side B would actually prevent you from actually putting any allies into play at this point.]\n 2. Fellowship immediately flips to side A, as you do not control 9 unique characters. Conveniently, you can also put (unique) allies into play now. [RR Initiating Abilities / Playing Cards [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule545] is good reference text for why this can happen in the middle of a sentence.]\n 3. You put into play Elfhelm/Jubayr/Súlien simultaneously. You now control 11 unique characters. 11 ≠ \"exactly 9\", so Fellowship stays on side A. To get it to flip to side B again, you'll have to lose (exactly) 2 characters.\n\nWhere this differs from @TheSpitfired [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/240687-thespitfired/]'s take is in step #3, where they essentially said you resolve the puttings into play individually and one at a time, but I say you do them all at the same time (similar to committing characters to the quest).\n\nMy evidence: Caldara is worded \"Discard Caldara to put 1 Spirit ally from your discard pile into play for each other hero you control with a printed Spirit resource icon.\" There is a ruling on spirit Elfhelm ally that I'll have to track down, but basically says the following:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> With spirit Elfhelm ready, encounter card effects that raise your threat \"by 1 for each [whatever]\" work thusly: the value is calculated first, your threat is raised by, say, 5, then Elfhelm kicks in for –1. (Not 1, –1, 1, –1, etc.)\n\nI take this to mean that Caldara's effect is also \"calculated\" completely—\"how many Spirit heroes do I have now? 3. so how many allies do I put into play? 3.\"—before firing as a single instance of putting multiple allies into play, as opposed to several instances of putting 1 ally into play. (The \"several instances\" interpretations would lead to the 1, –1, 1, –1, etc. Elfhelm situation above, which does not occur.) I similarly think that the allies from Reinforcements (\"put 2 allies into play…\") enter play simultaneously.\n\nEdited November 5, 2019 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/301848-caldara-and-fellowship-contract-wich-timing/?do=findComment&comment=3821868","commentId":3821868,"userName":"FMP_thE_mAd","timestamp":1572961749,"content":"Ok thank's for your answers everyone.\n\n \n\nI think the Allies come in play simultaneously too. So i'm agree with Sappidus solution.\n\n \n\nSo other question : can i choose not to put in play ALL Allies i could with Caldara ? For exemple here : can i choose to put in play juste Jubayr with the Caldara abilite ? (and then i can flip Contract again).\n\n \n\nI think it's not possible because when you are doing an effect, you have to do it at his maximum.

Unless you MUST have enough allies in discard pile to trigger Caldara's ability ?\n\nI think this is covered by RR Effects, http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule525 [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule525]:\n\n\n\n> When a non-targeting effect attempts to engage a number of entities (such as \"draw 3 cards\" or \"search the top 10 cards of your deck\") that exceeds the number of entities that currently exist in the specified game area, the effect engages as many entities as possible.\n\nThat clause of Caldara's ability is not a cost, so it nonoptionally puts into play as many allies as possible, i.e., it will put one into play if you only have one Spirit ally in your discard pile."}]}
