He's still obviously incredibly good, with his low threat and Asfaloth being his strongest assets imo. Nonetheless, I think resource generation and card draw is as important or even more important compared to what Glorfindel can offer. I have tried power decks with Glorfindel (Boromir-Loragorn-Glorfindel and Boromir-Galadriel-Glorfindel) and others like the Money Maker (Theodred-Grima-Arwen) and the super Bilbo deck (Bilbo-Beravor and the 3rd hero can be either Erestor, Loragorn or Galadriel - considering the errata on Love of Tales btw) and these last decks are much more consistent. Strong heroes right from the start (Boromir, Glorfindel, Gandalf, Elrond) are one way to build power decks, but a way I like even better is considering heroes who help you to setup incredibly well (Theodred, Beravor, Erestor, Galadriel, Arwen). Actually, it is my humble opinion that Galadriel is better than Glorfindel (I consider Galadriel the best Spirit hero and maybe the best hero in the game)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216636-refuse-to-play-spirit-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=2157179","commentId":2157179,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1460089108,"content":"I'd say Arwen is by far better than Galadriel.  And the only heroes I refuse to play are the garbage ones, like Bombur. \n\nEdited April 8, 2016 by Slothgodfather"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216636-refuse-to-play-spirit-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=2157217","commentId":2157217,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1460091507,"content":"I honestly think that Asfaloth is the main key to overuse of Glorfindel.\n\n \n\nWe have several great alternatives to him at this point in the game.\n\nSpirit Merry is fantastic at lowering threat and in a deck that features hobbits and hobbit mechanics he will often be a better choice than Glorfindel.\n\nArwen can be a fantastic replacement and although she has a higher starting threat she has the same willpower and her ability can boost a deck by so much it isn't funny. She provides card draw as well as both resource acceleration and resource smoothing. \n\nGaladriel became some what of a replacement for Glorfindel in many decks upon release as well and with Nenya she actually contributes more willpower than Glorfindel. She also has a fantastic ability and not only allows allies to quest for free the turn they enter play but also provides card draw and threat reduction. \n\nBecause both Arwen and Galadriel provide card draw they can help you draw into threat reduction faster which in a way helps combat the drawback of their higher starting threat. Galadriel lowers threat on her own and Arwen also provides resources which like the card draw will allow you to use threat reduction cards far faster and more efficiently. In the long run both of these heroes have the potential to benefit decks far more than Glorfindel will. \n\nFinally the upcoming Lanwyn hero is a fantastic replacement for Glorfindel. She has one less willpower but the same attack value and has ranged to boot. Her ability can boost her to 4 willpower if one surge card appears which already makes her willpower higher than Glorfindel and if two surge cards appear she can either have 6 willpower which is twice that of Glorfindel or she can have 4 willpower which is still higher and can ready and attack for 3 with ranged.\n\nSomewhat situational but in two or more player you do see surge cards at least every second or third turn and for certain quests during most turns in fact! Yes she is a bit more niche but can quest for far more than Glorfy and can attack for just as much but with ranged as well. Her readying ability is fairly similar to LoV. During the right quest or with the right amount of players she will be far more useful than Glorfindel. \n\n \n\nLoV + Glorfindel isn't even THAT great. Yes it negates his threat gain and yes it means you can use both his 3 will and 3 attack in one turn HOWEVER if you are running both LoV and Glorfindel he is more or less 100% the target for it......\n\nIf you are NOT running Glorfindel you can place LoV on so many other heroes some of which are potentially even better recipients than he is.\n\nIn a victory display deck make sure Rossiel has both bonuses set up. With LoV she can quest for 4 then defend with 4!\n\nElrond can quest for 3 then use Vilya or defend for 3 and honestly having backup/extra defenders is usually more important than having backup/extra attackers. Cirdan is an AMAZING target for LoV with his ring in play as he can quest for 4 AND then ready two allies and give them both +1A/+1D. \n\nThere are several other great targets for LoV and honestly I think it is not really a bonus anymore but is rather a setback because if you are running both LoV and Glorfindel you are more or less 100% going to need to attach it to him so he doesn't just raise your threat by several points over the course of a game. This means you can't place it on any of these better targets and are more or less restricted to putting it on him.\n\nThe last card to look at is Asfaloth, 1 progress is simply incomparable to 2 especially when it is something you can activate every turn. I honestly think Asfaloth is more or less useless if it isn't placed on Glorfindel and many other location control cards will serve you better. Without it however you are more or less forced to run other location control cards and many of them are extremely situational or subpar or the ones that are decent are usually one use and not repeatable effects. Location lock is an extremely unpleasant situation and it is far less fun or exciting to lose because of locations and location lock than it is to lose from threating out, losing heroes to nasty enemies/shadow effects etc.\n\nHis threat cost is obviously his main attraction but I think the main thing that this allows is secrecy decks and hero lineups that are powerful but don't have insane starting threat. He is used for his low starting threat in decks that feature two other high threat cost heroes, his low threat cost offsets the high ones and allows the deck to function properly without having to start on some extremely high threat level. He also serves as a very good strong hero in a lineup of low threat cost weaker heroes that rely on secrecy. Without LoV however he raises your threat over the course of a game which can in fact negate his low starting threat an be quite detrimental. \n\n \n\nSo long story short I think there are definitely several alternative heroes you can use instead of him at this point and as long as you are clever in the way that you build your decks or replace him you can easily offset the lower starting threat. Yes he is extremely useful and yes he fills a slot for CERTAIN decks that no other hero can but LoV sort of sucks on him when you consider other things you could pull off with it and I honestly think Asfaloth is the best thing about him because of how subpar the vast majority of location control cards are....\n\n \n\nAll that being said I personally do still use him in my decks and will not be removing him any time soon and it is purely because he allows me to run Arwen Elrond and him in a deck but remain at 27 starting threat and because of Asfaloth.\n\nIf we ever see another spirit Silvan or Noldor hero at 9 or less threat cost with at least 2 willpower (ideally 3) and we also see some sort of repeatable location control that rivals Asfaloth I will definitely look at removing Glorfindel from my decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216636-refuse-to-play-spirit-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=2157225","commentId":2157225,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1460092227,"content":"> I'd say Arwen is by far better than Galadriel.  And the only heroes I refuse to play are the garbage ones, like Bombur.\n\nI agree.

Of course spirit is the Willpower boost at the start of games so they shouldn't give that power to other spheres though in the long game I feel leadership trumps questing over spirit. Of course in general spirit has limited options for their heroes.\n\n \n\nThey have these awesome, auto includes but then they have a lot of flops where they are even hard to build around. Other than Celeborn and Sam, other spheres really don't have that pop them into the deck for questing for a reasonable threat. Even with Celeborn, if you don't play a silvan you feel a little robbed. I personally think, outside of those mentioned Spirit heroes the only other fessable auto include for a good early game experience is Samwise and seeing the deck list I am sure I am not alone on that.\n\n \n\nHigh willpower heroes are needed in early game to help with threat management until your army or attachments are out.

That's kind of still true, but I've warmed to him a certain amount. On the other hand, there are also better options depending on circumstances. And while I decried those who threw Glorfindel into every single deck they built for years, I went through a similar phase myself with Galadriel. \"This deck doesn't work how I want it to. Change one of the heroes to Galadriel, put in the Mirror, all fixed.\"\n\nAlso, since I've been playing through the quests Progression-style, I realise that when Glorfindel was released it's not just that he was a tremendously powerful option, it's that there were very few options full-stop. Even advancing to the end of Against the Shadow - Caldara needed mono-sphere, Nori and Oin needed Dwarves, Dwalin needed Orcs in the quest, Dunhere needed everyone to be low threat. Which left Eowyn, Eleanor, Frodo and Glorfindel as your options if you just wanted a Spirit hero to drop into a deck. A lot of people were less fond of Eleanor than me, and I imagine by Glorfindel's release people may have been tired of seeing Eowyn in every deck just as they were later tired of seeing Glorfindel in every deck. Add to that Glorfindel being the lowest threat hero and the only 3 attack option in Spirit at the time, with access to cheap action advantage, and it's no wonder he did so well. Now those things are less unique to him, so his only advantages are that he has all of them in one package, and Asfaloth."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216636-refuse-to-play-spirit-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=2160215","commentId":2160215,"userName":"awp832","timestamp":1460268420,"content":"i think it's still bizzare that in a game where people regularly include 3x steward of Gondor in every deck they make,  even going as far as to play 3x Good Harvest JUST so they can play Steward of Gondor... that people still complain about a hero with good stats and a low threat cost.  \n\nI doesn't make any sense to me that people do things like that, and 3x unexpected courage, etc.   and then they say that it's Glorfindel that's unbalanced.   Please."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216636-refuse-to-play-spirit-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=2162206","commentId":2162206,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1460375984,"content":"> i think it's still bizzare that in a game where people regularly include 3x steward of Gondor in every deck they make,  even going as far as to play 3x Good Harvest JUST so they can play Steward of Gondor... that people still complain about a hero with good stats and a low threat cost.  \n> \n> I doesn't make any sense to me that people do things like that, and 3x unexpected courage, etc.   and then they say that it's Glorfindel that's unbalanced.   Please.\n\ni agree.

Glorfindel becomes an odd hero choice since threat is honestly not often an issue and I don't plan on attacking if I'm focused on questing - so his stats often go to waste.  Granted, there are times when we'll play a deck that can accommodate both - like the Dunedain trap deck - but that deck is more combat oriented, so the deck that joins me should be more quest focused.  \n\n \n\nI did make a really fun Beregond, Mablung, Glorfindel deck a long time ago so that I could get Light and the Silver Lamp on Glorfindel, but with so many pieces to deal with it just didn't feel as solid as a pure tactics deck or someone using Burning Brand .... ...

It's the combination of Steward of Gondor, Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire that makes it ridiculously good. Or bad. And no, I don't consider it a fair amount of work to get him set up.\n\nThreat reduction is not much of a problem these days. Team him up with Spirit Merry and you'll reduce your threat if an enemy is revealed (and defending/attacking enemies is the main thing that Boromirs first action is good for) and that threat reduction is usually 2-4 meaning you get to ready Boromir 2-4 times \"for free\" that round which usually is enough.\n\nSteward of Gondor. The Hero that has it attached will get three resources per round. That's nice. And powerful. But don't seem too OP at first. The fact that the Hero also gets the Gondor trait which allows the Hero to attach Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire as well as get +2 defence from Gondorian Shield is what really makes Steward OP.\n\nSpeaking of Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire. I really don't like these two cards and never play them. It's far too easy to become a 10+ defender and 10+ attacker and they cost 0 to play!\n\nEdited April 17, 2016 by Mazarbul"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216636-refuse-to-play-spirit-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=2173898","commentId":2173898,"userName":"zeromage","timestamp":1460898116,"content":"It's ridiculous that people are complaining about Glorfindel being overpowered when Boromir exists in this game.\n\n \n\nI don't know what they were thinking when they designed gondorian fire and blood of numenor. Those cards should at least cost 1 each. There's really no contest over what the most broken hero in this game is. It's Boromir. I realize it takes a little set up time, but that's easily mitigated with Gondorian Shield. The shield gives you almost as much time as you need. Seastan beating Carn Dum (a quest that very recently people on this forum had a 17 page long discussion about how it was TOO HARD), revealing an EXTRA CARD every turn to handicap himself, shows just how insane Boromir is. And he got super unlucky and didn't even get a Gondorian Shield. \n\n \n\nI've played a game with 4 players, where in one turn Boromir blocked all four players enemies, and then killed all of their enemies in one turn. No one else even had to do anything during that combat phase. One was a newish player and said that the experience ruined the game for him. He asked why he even had to bring a deck. I couldn't disagree with him. \n\n \n\nYou shouldn't be able to get a hero to the point where you see 6 enemies on the board distributed amongst 4 players, all with multiple shadow cards, and say, \"I raise my threat by 12, block and kill them all, and my hero takes no damage!\" and you don't even have to look at the shadow cards.\n\n \n\nI also agree that GF and BoN should be limit one per character, but even that is too much power for Boromir. He honestly needs to be limited to 3 or 5 times per round. Treebeard is limit 5 times. So should Boromir. \n\nEdited April 17, 2016 by zeromage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216636-refuse-to-play-spirit-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=2175063","commentId":2175063,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1460990431,"content":"Please stop saying Boromir is broken or they might \"fix\" him.    Side note, I don't actually play with him at all, but I don't like the idea of errata to \"fix\" a card when it doesn't have to be played in the way you guys use to make it considered broken.\n\n \n\nAnd sure, Gondorian fire and the other defense attachment are awesome if you are sitting on resources, but I tend to like playing cards, so I tend to use my resources up - even in a deck with Steward - so without just stalling around building resources, those two attachments aren't worth much.    \n\n \n\nAnd yes, i get that is what makes Boromir powerful or OP, but to do that you need at least 3 different attachments, but you are also talking about the shield and maybe a signal, so 5 different attachments.   That is a lot of build up.  If anyone has 5 attachments on them they better be doing a lot of work anyways.\n\nEdited April 18, 2016 by Slothgodfather"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216636-refuse-to-play-spirit-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=2175164","commentId":2175164,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1460993763,"content":"Maybe instead of nerfing Boromir there just needs to be more cards that target characters with the most attachments.  \"When Revealed: Each character takes X damage where X is the number of attachments on that character.  \"Something about gaining surge if the effect doesn't do too much\" This effect cannot be canceled\".  Peace out Boromir :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nRandom stuff like that.\n\n \n\nAlthough, I think it'd be easier to fix the source of the problem than to just hurt other decks while also hurting Boromir.  I just don't use him because he is boring, but it's definitely a bit crazy how powerful he is.\n\nEdited April 18, 2016 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216636-refuse-to-play-spirit-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=2175240","commentId":2175240,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1460995287,"content":"Yea.

For Boromir to reach his potential, you need to build the entire deck around him - buff his attack/defense, maintain reliable threat reduction, be able to quest, etc. Glorfindel makes nearly every deck better, and is fairly ubiquitous.
