That means you could potentially discard and clear out a whole host of enemies in an encounter deck filled with nasty enemies.\n\n-- any hero. No restriction on type. The worry was that Mithril Shirt would be limited to hobbits or dwarves. No worries now.\n\n--as others have mentioned, it doesnt appear to have an exhaust mechanism. Meaning any treachery dealing damage should be essentially canceled or at least significantly mitigated. Same archery. It basically gives the hero \"toughness\" for those familiar with the saga term. Even toughness 1 would be solid on the right hero.\n\n-- on the same vein, shadow damage or card effects such as snow warg fizzle.\n\nPersonally love it. Seems to be one of the only guarded cards I would always feel comfortable playing (unless I was already location locked)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290618-the-fate-of-wilderland/?do=findComment&comment=3618506","commentId":3618506,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1549685093,"content":"> 7 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Radagast's staff works extremely well on ally Radagast in mono-tactics Eagles decks.\n\nGREAT call. I am very meh about the hero version now (even though I am proud to have called it), but that staff on the ally is great. Especially since you can send enemies back when needed, not during a specific phase. Technically after the encounter portion but before the combat phase.

I see little reason for not going with Radagast. The Staff is just amazing, and I think people, for some reason, underestimate the value of ‘free’ questing, especially if the combat stats are not bad. Yes, 2 attack is not amazing these days but usable in the beginning and 3 defense (especially in Lore) quite rare. Also, the Staff can do the other two tricks when needed, though the cost reduction seems by far the most valuable.\n\nI have always found Leadership to go great with the Eagles, because of Sneak Attack and A Very Good Tale, but then often were forced to go with two Tactics heroes because of the costs. Radagast feels like solving all these puzzles, he acts like a Tactics hero in terms of resources but a Lore hero in terms of a potential card draw or healing (though the latter might be redundant, or not have enough room for in the deck).\n\nEdited February 10, 2019 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290618-the-fate-of-wilderland/?do=findComment&comment=3619637","commentId":3619637,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1549808055,"content":"PS.

On one hand, you're thinning your deck pretty quickly (and permanently), and without gandalf/scrying you are gambling leaving cards on top of your deck.

Plus synergy with the doomed event cards is great and again both of us are angling on. \n\nI like that you made yours more of a fighter though and in general I really love your staff! My only concern is the removing cards from your deck like crazy. I think discarding it or putting it on the bottom would be two nicer and simpler options.

That strikes me as a little too high in terms of threat generation. Combined with Gandalf, that's 29 starting threat with a guaranteed 3 threat increase at the end of each round. That means (barring card effects that increase or decrease threat) that you will only have 7 rounds to complete most scenarios. Add to the picture that you will only have two heroes, this strikes me as a very hard duo to justify. That could just be me though.\n\nI love the encounter deck mechanic though. I could see increasing his cost by 2 or 3 threat, dropping the automatic threat increase, and adding to his line that at the end of the quest phase if the top card of the encounter deck has a shadow effect, he does not exhaust to defend.

I was really excited about Fierce Defence and got disappointed. Maybe I will be here too, but I am super excited now. Maybe it is a style of play. It feels similar to the card like Gildor’s Counsel.

Between mablung ability and radagast staff resources should not be an issue and green will feed tons of card draw and fetching options to make sure you have always cards to play.
