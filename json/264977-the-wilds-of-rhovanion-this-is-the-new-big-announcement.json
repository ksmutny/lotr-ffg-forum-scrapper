I'm a bit surprised because it seems very specific, and the previous Dale allies are more about location control than anything.

The player cards in this expansion might be only focused on the Dale trait, in which case Leadership Brand might be the other hero. We see Dale-related cards in every sphere, whereas The Voice of Isengard (the only deluxe to focus on two traits so far) had no Rohan-related Lore and Leadership cards (except Grima) and no cards that reference the Isengard trait in Tactics and Spirit (though thematically The Wizard's Voice and Power of Orthanc are connected to Isengard). Specifically, the fact that we're getting a Leadership event that's useless if you don't have a Dale hero makes me think there's a decent chance we're getting a Leadership Dale hero. On the other hand, The Wilds of Rhovanion covers a lot of territory, and there are plenty of possible heroes they could include. If we don't get them in the deluxe, I think there's a good chance we'll get Thranduil and Thorin Stonehelm in the following cycle. A new version of Dain Ironfoot as well as Grimbeorn the Old are other possibilities.\n\nSince Bard son of Brand is numbered 2, the other hero should be Leadership or Tactics. Since Warrior of Dale has a bow in his art and seems to not have the Ranged keyword (Tactics Beregond, for example, has the Sentinel keyword at the beginning of his text box, before his cost-reducing ability), there's a good chance we'll get a bow (probably not racially restricted) that can attach to allies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264977-the-wilds-of-rhovanion-this-is-the-new-big-announcement/?do=findComment&comment=3119622","commentId":3119622,"userName":"ppsantos","timestamp":1512975362,"content":"\"Wilds of Rhovanion\" but the cover art shows a sprawling walled city/fortress.

(Some of this I found through the COTR discord.) The announcement article said that the expansion contains 2 heroes and 39 player cards (3 copies of 13), so it will have more player cards than Khazad-Dûm and The Sands of Harad, fewer player cards than Heirs of Númenor, and the same number as The Voice of Isengard, The Lost Realm, and The Grey Havens. Anything in square brackets below is speculation.\n\n1 Brand son of Bain (fully spoiled)\n\n2 Bard son of Brand (fully spoiled)\n\n[3] Redwater Sentry:\n\nmec65_a4_cardfan.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/2f/c6/2fc602d1-f848-4228-9ab0-716884b02f9d/mec65_a4_cardfan.png]\n\nThe name is confirmed through the artist's Instagram:\n\n\n\nThe text is likely: Reduce the [cost to play Armor attachments on] Redwater [Sentry by 1.] Redwater [Sentry gets +1 defense and gains sentinel] while it has [an Armor attachment.]\" This is pretty much confirmed by the Spanish card fan:image.png [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/145983826500255745/454828856935710720/image.png]\n\n4 North Realm Lookout (spoiled in fan)\n\n5 Warrior of Dale (fully spoiled)\n\n6 Long Lake Trader (fully spoiled)\n\n[7 Leadership attachment with Armor and Item traits that can attach to Redwater Sentry; almost certainly not limited to Dale characters]\n\n8 King of Dale (fully spoiled)\n\n9 Bow of Yew (fully spoiled)\n\n[10 Lore Item attachment that can attach to Dale allies and likely heroes; very likely not limited to Dale characters]\n\n11 Necklace of Girion (fully spoiled)\n\n12 Traffic from Dale (fully spoiled)\n\n[13] To Arms!:\n\nmec65_cardfan_a1.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/1b/ae/1baeab8a-91aa-46f3-9d3d-e43512c84fb8/mec65_cardfan_a1.png]\n\nThe text has a good chance of being: \"Action: Choose an ally with a player [attachment. Ready that ally.]\"\n\n[14 Tactics event]\n\n[15 Lore or Neutral event]\n\nThe card numbering suggests that Necklace of Girion is the last attachment, so there should be four events. (It could be three events and a side quest, but that seems less likely since the last deluxe focused on side quests. We could also get an Encounter player card, but we just got one in The Crossings of Poros and we'll be getting one in Roam Across Rhovanion. I expect a Lore event that shuffles a player card into the Encounter deck at some point, but not here.) There are no Lore Dale heroes, and there's no way for a Dale deck to play Lore events without a sphere match (King of Dale can play off-sphere allies, and Bard son of Brand can play off-sphere Item attachments), so we might not get a Lore event in this box.\n\nCard 7 could technically be a neutral ally, but a Leadership Armor attachment makes much more sense, especially since there's no Armor attachment from the core set (for players who get this as their first expansion) that can go on Redwater Sentry. Like Bow of Yew, it might say \"Attach to a Dale or Warrior character,\" and given how prominent the shield is in Redwater Sentry's art, it might be a shield. \n\nThe numbering is Leadership-Spirit-Tactics-Lore in each card type, so card 10 is likely a Lore attachment (it has a slim chance of being Tactics or Neutral). It's probably an Item, so that Bard can play it, and in a preview discussing the deluxe Caleb said the Dale trait \"rewards you for playing attachments on your allies.\" The only attachment in the Core Set that can be played on allies is Self Preservation (which is not an item), and Bow of Yew and the Leadership Armor attachment don't seem like enough attachments for allies if a new player gets this as their first expansion (neither King of Dale nor Necklace of Girion can go on allies). It's likely a cheap, generically useful attachment that could work well on North Realm Lookout.\n\nAs a thematic player, I like getting more generic attachments (like Bow of Yew) that can thematically fit into a wide variety of decks. There's also a fair amount of room in the design space to explore attachments on allies, which can make some allies feel more like heroes (such as ally Legolas with Bow of the Galadhrim). If we never get an ally version of Aragorn, then with all these attachments for allies coming up, I hope we get one that I can play on Vigilant Dunadan to boost his willpower by 1: he could represent Aragorn in my thematic campaign (with hobbit heroes for The Black Riders) for A Knife in the Dark and Flight to the Ford, but I want him to have two willpower to be able to defend against the Witch-king and survive Power in their Terror.  I'm also still hoping for Merry and Pippin allies for The Road Darkens, for an Éomer ally (who can be Sword-thained to kill Uglúk) for the Uruk-hai, and for a Grimbold hero (to go with Gandalf and Erkenbrand in a reinforcements deck) for Helm's Deep.\n \n\nEdited June 9, 2018 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264977-the-wilds-of-rhovanion-this-is-the-new-big-announcement/?do=findComment&comment=3368325","commentId":3368325,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1528586330,"content":"Thanks for those informations.
