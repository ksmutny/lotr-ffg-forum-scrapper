If it's a treachery then you just discard it after resolving it's effects. This still counts as revealing your one card from the deck, so you are questing against 0 threat in the staging area in this case."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134437-does-surge-effect-continue-if-the-next-card-pulled-was-another-treachery-card-and-there-are-still-no-other-cards-in-the-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=1441049","commentId":1441049,"userName":"thrylos1","timestamp":1423459077,"content":"Thank you for the quick response and clarification! "}]}
