In a 2 player game for example, you fetch a spawn from were ever it is and you can take a spider card from either the encounter discard or encounter deck The quest has the text \"spider card of your choice\" So if the spider you want is not in the encounter deck you can take it from the discard pile. Though it might be best to always take form the encounter deck as that is one less spider you can reveal. Either way no matter what you need to shuffle the encounter deck\n\nEDIT - oh ... you do not HAVE to pick Spawn... though you kinda need to as you have to \"find it\" and \"kill it\" to compleat this quest. So if you do not take it fomr discard pile you need to cycle the entire encounter deck and draw it again b4 you can win.\n\n \"When Revealed: Each player must search the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 Spider card of his choice, and add it to the staging area.
