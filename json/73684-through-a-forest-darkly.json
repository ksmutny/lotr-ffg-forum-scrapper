I just hope it's not going to be a POD thing, as they would (presumably) need to be shuffled into the main encounter deck.

I like that idea. I wonder if it's going to be new cards for a specific quest or these cards are general in their use and can be used for any encounter deck. Either way, deck building encounter decks sounds awesome. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73684-through-a-forest-darkly/?do=findComment&comment=721572","commentId":721572,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1352634443,"content":"Hope someone is there and soon we can get some report about event…….
