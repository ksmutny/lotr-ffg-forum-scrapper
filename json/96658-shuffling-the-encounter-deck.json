Can't seem to remember all the rules after a 2 yr break. I know the discard pile doesn't get shuffled into the encountere deck unless it runs out, and then not until the questing phase. But when an encounter or quest card tell you to search the discard pile and the encounter deck and then shuffle the encounter deck, do you just shuffle just what remains of the encounter deck or do you shuffle the discard pie back into the encounter deck? thanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96658-shuffling-the-encounter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=951329","commentId":951329,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1389394047,"content":"It normally says to shuffle the encounter deck or shuffle back something in the encouter deck.\n\nIf it doesn't say to shuffle the discard pile, don't do it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96658-shuffling-the-encounter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=951752","commentId":951752,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1389454959,"content":"Thanks!
