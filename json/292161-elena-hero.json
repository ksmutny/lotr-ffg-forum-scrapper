Her character card has new art, making me think she'll be a hero in the next cycle. Her theme seems to be related to music and songs, so if they continue that, we could have finally have support for the Minstrel trait?\n\nAs for an ability, maybe draw a card after you play a song. I think they already have enough resource acceleration with Love of Tales. Alternatively, they could go the standard route of Elena can pay for song cards without a resource match.Â Thoughts?Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292161-elena-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3647027","commentId":3647027,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1552498182,"content":"Has the name Elena any elfic root? ðŸ˜±"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292161-elena-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3647034","commentId":3647034,"userName":"webslinger9","timestamp":1552498415,"content":"> 3 minutes ago, Yepesnopes said:\n> \n> Has the name Elena any elfic root? ðŸ˜±\n\nFrom other threads I've seen, it means something like \"of the stars\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292161-elena-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3647174","commentId":3647174,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1552507879,"content":"Here's my idea for an Elena hero, and her signature song, the Lay of Twilight.\n\nI'm considering switching the Defense and Willpower values around, because I'm not sure that the strong defense is thematically sound, but I like the uniqueness of this stat line.\n\nElena-Front-Face.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2019_03/Elena-Front-Face.jpg.91b798fe85035f99fcc4d9102baf7a34.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2019_03/Elena-Front-Face.jpg.91b798fe85035f99fcc4d9102baf7a34.jpg]\n\nLay-of-Twilight-Front-Face.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2019_03/Lay-of-Twilight-Front-Face.jpg.e6df201219bd149d43d8ca9b0f2951a6.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2019_03/Lay-of-Twilight-Front-Face.jpg.e6df201219bd149d43d8ca9b0f2951a6.jpg]\n\nEdited March 13, 2019 by Onidsen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292161-elena-hero/?do=findComment&comment=3647184","commentId":3647184,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1552508425,"content":"Lorefindel thanks you for the Lay of Twlight:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI'd like the idea of development for the minstrel trait and a hero supporting it. We have a good number of songs now, just waiting for the right series of cards to organize them into an archetype. We do have a little bit of an archetype that has formed around Hobbits with Fireside Song, but I've barely seen anyone use it (outside of, say, tackling Mt.
