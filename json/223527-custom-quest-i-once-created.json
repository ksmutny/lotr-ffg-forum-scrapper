I challenged myself with creating a LotR Quest that uses MtG art entirely (or mostly). I also like undead very much, so quest is about it as well as about myserious vampires mentioned in LotR lore.\n\n \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/ZN6Ao [http://imgur.com/a/ZN6Ao]\n\n \n\nJust felt like sharing as there no point in just keeping it in the dust.

Maybe because I never actually played with anything that used that art. Too bad I didn't, maybe. I very much enjoy the theme on those cards.

The only things I don't like are, apart from some typos, the names of some cards. A card named \"An Altar\" sounds awkward. Same thing for Hungry Dead. It's funny not in a good way. Even though it's a more obscure word, something like Ravenous Dead or Voracious Dead sounds better for this game. But that's still my opinion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223527-custom-quest-i-once-created/?do=findComment&comment=2286713","commentId":2286713,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1467186221,"content":"Also, I never play Black in Magic (only Green and White) so many of these cards, while I recognize them, can't say the name or what it does. The great vampire is in Magic a demon dragon called Malfegor which is really recognizable, apart from that, only some of them stand out uncomfortably, and many of these aren't from Magic. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223527-custom-quest-i-once-created/?do=findComment&comment=2286755","commentId":2286755,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1467190284,"content":"They really aren't?

Even Innistrad, possibly its lowest fantasy setting ever, has werewolves, vampires, ghosts and various other beings.

The only non-human creatures in the human deck are geists (ghosts) and angels, with both races known to be allied to humans (at least at the beginning). Also there's a bird. That's not really opposing the human theme.\n\n \n\nAnd those weird winged creatures are this world's version of hyppogryff, with the head of a heron instead of eagle.
