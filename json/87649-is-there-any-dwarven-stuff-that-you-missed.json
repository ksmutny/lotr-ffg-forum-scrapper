First I would have liked cards with references to the different dwarf kingdoms such as the Blue Mountains for example, and the different \"strains\" of this race like the Petty-dwarves and the rest besides the longbeards. Also, I would have absolutely loved to have one or two of the lost Seven, perhaps if the cycle had been about a mission from a dwarf king to recover one of the Seven in Moria and encountering the Balrog in the end, for example, instead of the rather bland storyline we got for Dwarrodelf.

Yeah, I think fondly of the old Decipher game where they produced just about any item they could for the dwarves to get a pump in stats.
