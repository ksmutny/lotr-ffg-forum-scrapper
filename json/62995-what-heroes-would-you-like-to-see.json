With the announcement of the new major expansion and Watcher in the Water coming out soon and yet to have a hero announced, I was just wondering what are people's thoughts on what heroes you'd like to see. Keep in mind this doesn't have to be who you think it's actually going to be, just heroes that you think should be included at some point. Personally I'd really like to see Theoden, he was always one of my favorite characters and could potentially be something similar to Dain where he has a \"leadership effect\" due to being King of Rohan. Anybody else? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62995-what-heroes-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=616516","commentId":616516,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1334173163,"content":"elrond, faramir (he was always one of my favourites), sam, merry, pippin"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62995-what-heroes-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=616558","commentId":616558,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1334178949,"content":"Yes!

I think they've already gone away from the \"17 years between Bilbo's birthday and leaving the Shire\" thing because Frodo has been included as a hero, as has Eowyn and several others where the ages don't quite add up. Pippin and Merry will be interesting for sure, as I'm sure Sam will. Has anyone else been picturing Sam as a Spirit hero with A LOT of willpower? Because of any character in the Lord of the Rings universe, Sam had to have a lot of willpower and heart. Without him Frodo would've died many times over. I'd also like to see Elrond, I know he's been mentioned as a Gandalf like ally, but I don't think he'd be totally unreasonable as a powerful, high threat hero or something. Another elf I'd like to see included is Thranduil (Legolas' father). I guess last cycle would've been a better time for him to come out, but I guess there's always hope."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62995-what-heroes-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=616612","commentId":616612,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1334189357,"content":" Good thoughts about Sam!

I also agree with whomever said that they hope Gandalf does not make an appearance as a hero. He is so thematically right on the money it isn't even funny. He's always leaving and appearing at just the right moment to save the day, just like in the card game. Eomer is another character I think needs to make an appearance in the game at some point, and Tactics probably would be the sphere for him. I think he would make a great candidate for the hero with a higher willpower for tactics, as he was a great leader as well as a fighter. I think Thranduil would fit best as a leadership hero, he's the King of Mirkwood after all.

The thing that really inspired me about these two is their dramatic change throughout the trilogy. My favorite part was when they returned to The Shire at the end because they didn't realize how much they had changed, and the reader didn't realize how much they had changed, but when they were put back where they started, it was plain to see how much they had developed and grown in courage. The image of them riding through the town in their armor got me so excited. It is that rendition of Merrry and Pippin that I would like to see. The timeline makes it unlikely that we'll see them, since that is pretty much the very end of the third age (or had the 4th age begun by that point?), but the Saga Expansions give me hope that we may some day return to The Shire to fight orcs and overthrow Saruman, and maybe, just maybe, Peregrin of the Guard and Meriadoc of the Mark will be there to aid in that quest.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62995-what-heroes-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=618597","commentId":618597,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1334635281,"content":"Budgernaut said:\n\n...but both of our repeat heroes have the exact same threat, willpower, attack, defense, and hit points. \n\n\n\nWho´s the second hero?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62995-what-heroes-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=618613","commentId":618613,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1334640315,"content":"As someone who really wants to like Tactics, I'd be whining less if they suddenly decided to throw a 3 willpower Glorfindel into that sphere.

Bilbo does not have the same stats exactly but I see what you are saying, I believe if they make new Glorfindel he shall indeed have the same stats (even though the low defence is a bit laughable thematicaly). The designer said he shall either be Tactics or Spirit, if he is spirit we might even see him up next but Tactics would really do with a 3 willpower hero. What I am most looking forward to is a new and better ability though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62995-what-heroes-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=618622","commentId":618622,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1334642267,"content":"muemakan said:\n\n \n\nWho´s the second hero?\n\n\n\nBifur weighs in at 7 threat vs 8 points of stats."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62995-what-heroes-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=618630","commentId":618630,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1334644537,"content":"Dam said:\n\nmuemakan said:\n\n \n\n \n\nWho´s the second hero?\n\n \n\n \n\nBifur weighs in at 7 threat vs 8 points of stats.\n\n\n\nI think what was meant was who is the second repeated hero beside Aragorn: well the also-previewed Bilbo.\n\nAnyway, as for heroes whose threat cost does not match the sum of their other stats: Bilbo (Lore), Bifur, Elladan, Elrohir."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62995-what-heroes-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=618766","commentId":618766,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1334667564,"content":" Sorry, I forgot that the new Bilbo had a zero for threat, so he isn't 100% identical. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62995-what-heroes-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=618872","commentId":618872,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1334685889,"content":"Budgernaut said:\n\n Sorry, I forgot that the new Bilbo had a zero for threat, so he isn't 100% identical. \n\n\n\nNot to mention other defense and other hit points....."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62995-what-heroes-would-you-like-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=618956","commentId":618956,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1334700874,"content":"muemakan said:\n\nBudgernaut said:\n\n \n\n Sorry, I forgot that the new Bilbo had a zero for threat, so he isn't 100% identical. \n\n \n\n \n\nNot to mention other defense and other hit points.....\n\n\n\nOkay, so I'm totally unattentive.

I really like the new characters and I'm very curious what FFG could come up with. I think there is nothing wrong with venture a little bit away from the books storyline and heroes, but staying close to its heart and core feeling of the Middle Earth World.\n\nAlso, I would love to see a second version of Eowyn. I was a little sceptical about the two Aragorns, but now I like the idea. For some characters in the book it could work (not for everyone). Eowyn has two aspects as well. She is not only a shieldmaid and quester, but a brave fighter.

I'm starting to think that no matter what heroes they put out, they need to start looking at what each sphere is missing. Tactics obviously needs someone who can quest, as the highest willpower any hero has is two and most of the allies they have are either 0 or 1. I like the idea of Eowyn making an appearance for Tactics, hopefully she'd retain some of her high willpower though!"}]}
