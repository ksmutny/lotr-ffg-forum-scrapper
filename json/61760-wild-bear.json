The [rules, pg 18] reads, \"when resolving enemy attacks, follow these four steps.\" The main issue I see with that interpretation is that it is conflating the resolution of an attack with the act itself, and making the jump to the conclusion that anything that does not happen during the resolution of an attack (such as the dealing of a Shadow card) is not a part of the attack.\n\nThe main reason that Shadow cards are dealt at the beginning of the combat phase is that they serve as a convenient means of portraying which enemies have yet to act when combat is being resolved. (If an enemy has a face down shadow card, it still needs to resolve its attack.) Of course, this breaks down when the encounter deck empties mid shadow phase, but in most cases it serves its purpose, particularly early in most players' games, when they are still learning the basic mechanics -- it amounts to one less \"memory issue\" and stumbling point in those early experiences.\n\nThat said, it is worth specifying that Shadow cards should be dealt for enemies that attack outside the combat phase, so thanks for bringing it up -- I'll put it on the FAQ list. And yes, if the game is \"foolish\" enough to launch an attack during staging and open up action windows, the players can take full advantage of those action windows as they see fit.\n\n(http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/777895/what-constitutes-an-attack [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/777895/what-constitutes-an-attack])\n\n---\n\nBasically, an attacking enemy will ALWAYS be dealt a shadow card (if possible), even if the attack occurs outside of the combat phase. So, ignore my earlier comment, as Nate's ruling explicitly contradicts my assessment. \n\nAgain, the Bear WILL attack twice on any turn in which it engages a player, and it WILL be dealt a shadow card for each attack.\n\nI think it's a curious decision on his part. Not necessarily a bad one from a gameplay standpoint (makes Wild Bear quite a bit more threatening), but a strange choice nonetheless. The rule book (p.18) seemed to be pretty clear regarding the precise method and timing of dealing shadow cards, and this ruling makes portions of the shadow text on cards like Wolf Rider and Chieftain of the Pit somewhat superfluous. Still, it means that enemy attacks outside the combat phase are treated exactly like those during the combat phase (including opportunities for player actions between each step of the attack). Even though I'm not sold on the rationale here, it does a good job of creating a simple, general rule for a particular game mechanic. That should clear up much of the confusion surrounding ambush, which is definitely a good thing in my book.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61760-wild-bear/?do=findComment&comment=605996","commentId":605996,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1331811450,"content":" Also, it means Quick Strike or other Actions could be used in action windows between each step of the attack.

Because you never had the option of choosing a specific attacker (it has to be a bear), the attack begins at step 2 : choosing a defender. After that, the action window opens as normal.\n\nI guess this is linked to the fact that he is revealed out of the combat phase, in phases where you never have a specific step to choose an attacker (because there usually isn't any). You have to deal with it immediately. Otherwise, this would generate a weird situation...for instance, if you're already engaged with say, Orcs of Dol Guldur. During the staging step, you draw Wild bear...would you really have the option to engage another enemy ? In essence, preserving the first step of the attack (choosing attackers) could mean we are ambushed by a bear, but attacked by orcs instead. Granted, as Anodos said, we could say that the Forced effect simply replaces Step1 of the attack, and that the action window normally between Stap 1 and 2 could be preserved, but as Bomb added, it would go against the spirit of the Ambush keyword to be able to play Quick Strike before defenders are chosen.\n\nAs the official ruling said about Shadow Cards, the way things were laid out in the rulebook seem to be geared more towards learning the game and less towards defining timing, which is kind of a bummer since now we have a bunch of timing issues. I love the game but I feel every new addition will bring more and more errata, and will make the game harder to learn in the long run for people less familiar with CCGs and all the lexical complexities they bring. The term ''immediate'', for instance, sometimes brings confusion.\n\nOf course, this is only my two cents. At that point, speculating might seems pointless unless we have an official clarifications on the subject. However, I believe that by posting interpretations and questions, we might help FF in defining a ruling on this particular issue (or any rules issue, actually)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61760-wild-bear/?do=findComment&comment=606070","commentId":606070,"userName":"guest479094","timestamp":1331821643,"content":" \"Immediate attack\" seems to most reasonably mean (particularly inflight of this latest ruling) \"an attack right now\" (in which you deal out a shadow card and follow the 4 steps) and not \"do step 1 right now\". IOW, \"immediate\" in the sense it is used every where else - to designate a forced interrupt in the normal flow of play, not a skipping of some step. Also, \"attack\" seems (esp. in light of the ruling) distinct from \"choose an enemy\".  \n\nAnd even if it does mean the latter, I still don't see this negating an action at the end of step 1 regardless of whether step 1 was immediatley forced or not. Nothing in the rules specifies that there is an action window at the of step 1 only if it wasn't forced. That step 1 may be forced doesn't negate the rule that says to do each step and that you can take actions after each step. Not unless \"immediately\" also means \"skip\". Given what the rules do say and what the card doesn't say, barring some ruling to the contrary or some rule yet to be revealed, I can't see any reasonable way to rule out an action before the defender is declared. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61760-wild-bear/?do=findComment&comment=606080","commentId":606080,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1331822503,"content":" Yeah...I see what you mean...I guess the confusion comes from the preview itself and it's inference regarding Quick Strike.
