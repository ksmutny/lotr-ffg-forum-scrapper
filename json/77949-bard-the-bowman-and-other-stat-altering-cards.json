Does Bard's ability take effect as soon as the attack is declared, or after it is resolved? Given the writing of the news article, I'm thinking it takes effect after it is resolved. I'm assuming the same thing would happen for other abilities that lower defense or attack of a target after attacking it (though I can't think of other examples at the moment)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77949-bard-the-bowman-and-other-stat-altering-cards/?do=findComment&comment=751745","commentId":751745,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1358877796,"content":"But if it takes effect after it resolves, it wouldn't be of any use for Bard !!\n\nGuess it only makes sense if it takes effect at the start."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77949-bard-the-bowman-and-other-stat-altering-cards/?do=findComment&comment=751779","commentId":751779,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1358881984,"content":"Bard the Bowman:\nWhen Bard the Bowman makes a ranged attack â€¦\n\nIt is the same wording on the errata'd Dol Guldur Beastmaster, so it will take effect when it is declared as an attacker using range attack."}]}
