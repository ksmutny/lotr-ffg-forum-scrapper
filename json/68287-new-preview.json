well.\n\n\n\n \n\nGotta agree with lleimmoen on the Green Dwarves, they add as much as the blue will. \n\nYou DID take the words out of my mouth for my thoughts on Thorin, though.  I wasn't blown away, to put it mildly.  Artwork wasn't at the level as recent heroes have been.  And since I won't run him with Dain (more in a second), his gametext is only kinda…. meh.  Why not with Dain?  Realistically, because I love my green AND blue additions to the Dwarven deck.  Running two high-threat leadership dwarves in a single deck borders on near absurdity (apologies if anyone thinks that too strong a term), for a number of reasons.  I will not go so far as to say it CAN'T be done… lol… just don't see the logic.  To do so means you:\n\n1)  Give up either a green or blue hero to draw in the much-needed support from those spheres (sorry Red, as always you are relegated to my 2nd dwarven deck).  So now you're adding Songs to your deck to bring in those other allies/events you need from that third (or fourth if you want the red) sphere.  Again, YES it can be done, it just forces you to raise your card count OR drop other cards that are valuable to your synergy.  No bueno.\n\n2)  Start with unnecessarily hight threat, forcing you to use Dwalin (and I do, but I will admit his threat reduction response doesn't trigger as often as you might hope sometimes), or to include more threat reduction in your hand (or hope to high heaven you keep pulling Gandalf and Sneak Attack throughout the game).  Again, starts messing with your synergy and count.\n\n3)  On the plus side, Thorin's ability is perfectly suited to Dwarven themes in the game…. sheer numbers.  You can get a good number of them out for cheap and early, and getting an extra resource is always welcome.  However, you can gather that extra resource by simpler means (Steward…, Zigil, etc…) that are most likely already in your deck (please tell me they're in your deck… lol).\n\n4)  Another plus, his willpower and attack are great (and with Dain's bump, puts him up there with the Holy Grail of questing, Eowyn).  And since none of his gametext is tied to specific phases (questing, defend, attack… like Dwalin, for instance), he really becomes a \"utility\" hero…. he can be used for pretty much anything.  Yeah his 1 defence doesn't do anything for him, but with solid starting HP, he becomes perfectly suited to team with the red dwarves for fighting…\n\nSo what this means (I don't claim that everyone else's approach should be the same) is that Thorin will be a perfect fit as the \"leader\" of a second dwarven deck that can be played alongside the first (led by Dain).  This gives him the best of both worlds.   Pair him with a red or two (or Gloin), and create a minion-slaying gang that can keep the pressure off of Dain's questing crew…\n\nOf course, this all could change based on Orcrist's game text does for him…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68287-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=666056","commentId":666056,"userName":"Bullroarer

I suspect they'll have player card backs (the ring design) but have special scenario rules setting them aside (a la The Watcher). They'll probably be \"unlocked\" by exploring a certain location or progressing past a particular quest stage. Then, when you play the next scenario(s) in that progression, you can include the treasures in your draw deck. But it seems like you won't be able to just put treasures in your deck and play, say, Massing at Osgiliath. They only work within Hobbit scenarios, and only if you play those scenarios as a connected campaign.\n\nI'm particularly intrigued by Caleb's revelation that treasures are immune to effects that target attachments. From the FAQ, we know that treasures should count as attachments (as any card that attaches to another card is considered an attachment in addition to its other types). So, there must be an explicit rule granting treasures this special protection. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68287-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=666381","commentId":666381,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1343722290,"content":"Very excited about this preview.

FFG has done an excellent job (from what I've seen), and I hope they'll keep their standard high.\n\nI'm not familiar enough with the artists yet to comment on your second point.\n\n\n\nthank you kindly happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68287-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=666434","commentId":666434,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1343727709,"content":"Mattr0polis said:\n\nstarhawk77 said:\n\n \n\nI'm particularly intrigued by Caleb's revelation that treasures are immune to effects that target attachments.

The focus in this game as it is not competitive is to make each quest or expansion function , be fun and play well in isolation. It wouldn't surprise me if this inconsistency is simply nvr discussed .."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68287-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=666601","commentId":666601,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1343747460,"content":"well, the card type is treasure instead of attachment…that seems to me to be enough of a difference (without having the rule book in front of me at the moment). cards that remove attachments would be removing cards that have the attachment type. the treasures are the treasure card type."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68287-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=666606","commentId":666606,"userName":"player2052423","timestamp":1343748369,"content":"My guess is that the Hobbit edition will be released at GenCon.  It's mid August this year."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68287-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=666635","commentId":666635,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1343751610,"content":"Dain Ironfoot said:\n\nwell, the card type is treasure instead of attachment…that seems to me to be enough of a difference (without having the rule book in front of me at the moment). cards that remove attachments would be removing cards that have the attachment type. the treasures are the treasure card type.\n\n\n\nExcept that's not how they ruled it for other non-attachment card types before treasures…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68287-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=666640","commentId":666640,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1343751945,"content":"you are right…they also just updated the FAQ and clarified some additional stuff re: attachments."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68287-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=666641","commentId":666641,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1343751957,"content":"you are right…they also just updated the FAQ and clarified some additional stuff re: attachments."}]}
