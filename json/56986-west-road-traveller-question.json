This way you could gain the benefits twice. Forest Gate would be a good example, which allows the first player to draw two cards when you travel there."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56986-west-road-traveller-question/?do=findComment&comment=562448","commentId":562448,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1322726324,"content":"I do not have the card yet but I hope the answer is there is no travel effect - they might have mentioned it to make sure though.\n\nAlso, it is interesting that is says \"after you play it from your hand\", which means it does not take effect when you use Stand and Fight or Sneak Attack, right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56986-west-road-traveller-question/?do=findComment&comment=562486","commentId":562486,"userName":"Puzzle2","timestamp":1322732448,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\nI do not have the card yet but I hope the answer is there is no travel effect - they might have mentioned it to make sure though.\n\nAlso, it is interesting that is says \"after you play it from your hand\", which means it does not take effect when you use Stand and Fight or Sneak Attack, right?\n\n\n\nSneak Attack says specifically to \" put 1 ally card into play from your hand\", so you should still be able trigger this effect.
