Neither the Hobbit Saga nor any of the cards we have seen so far from the Númenor cycle have the Secrecy keyword. I can understand it for the Hobbit as this expansion is very much designed to be played with only the Core set. However, it is a disappointment that none of the spoiled Númenor cards have had Secrecy although I believe a couple of the new allies make good candidates.\n\nI think the Secrecy mechanism was a very nice idea that expanded the options for game variations but we have had too few Secrecy cards to really make it work. If they already stop putting any more cards out I doubt Secrecy decks will be used much in the future. So, FFG please do not forget about Secrecy!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72714-has-ffg-forgotten-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=709155","commentId":709155,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1350172636,"content":" I believe we will see more secrecy, at least on the new cycle Against the Shadow.\n\n \n\nFor me, it makes sense to join secrecy with fighting the shadows that come from Mordor.\n\n \n\nHowever, as we are talking about Gondor and their effort to keep the enemies away from the free lands of Middle-Earth it could lead to no secrecy and more fight. But I believe that we will get both in the upcoming AP's, if not in HoN. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72714-has-ffg-forgotten-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=709202","commentId":709202,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1350185296,"content":" Well we haven't seen any eagles since the first cycle.

I was really expecting to see some of cost 3 secrecy 2 allies to boost early rounds when the hero is missing (as most secrecy deck will probably only have two heroes, though I think the best ones have Glorfindel and two other low cost heroes). Yet, we have only got one secrecy ally and he's for coop which is quite strange as I think solo is better suited for secrecy.\n\nOn a completely different note.

It is a very good suggestion that FFG should simply add the Secrecy explanation to the deluxe set rule \"book\" which has multiple pages and better room than the adventure pack's one page rule sheets. Then, maybe, FFG could just put a short reference to the deluxe rules in the smaller adventure packs… FFG, please listen."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72714-has-ffg-forgotten-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=709629","commentId":709629,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1350289490,"content":"Good points all; you know, it's such a simple mechanic, new players could also learn about it by typing it into there google search engine. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72714-has-ffg-forgotten-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=709689","commentId":709689,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1350297797,"content":"it could just be solved by adding at the end of the rules insert a web link with 'errata and rules updates' on….well, ok not solved fully, as it assumes internet access, but so does the FAQ……\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72714-has-ffg-forgotten-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=709697","commentId":709697,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1350299210,"content":" It's okay to assume internet access for an FAQ.\n\n \n\nFantasy Flight seems very reluctant to assume internet access for basic products. Also their policy of reprinting rules for games has been shown in other multi-expansion areas.\n\n\nI mean Arkham horror had to reprint rules that were introduced in the first expansion in every subsequent expansion because they were so basic as to be included in every future release - but FFG still couldn't assume people had any of the prior expansions in the last big box expansion they did.

It also means you could make two identical cards (in theory) and they only difference is one of them has secrecy. So it allows them to do more card variations.\n\nIn practice I would expect a card with secrecy as a keyword to cost 1 more than a card that didn't have the word. That way if you get it before your threat is too high you get to be cheaper, but if you fail you have the penalty of an extra resource cost. If (As in my simplified example above) the cost was the same then you'd never use the card without the secrecy keyword."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72714-has-ffg-forgotten-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=709836","commentId":709836,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1350317950,"content":"Yes for the above. I think the mechanic is ok, the card pool is poor. But I am in the group that likes the idea and I hope (and expect) to see more secrecy cards in the future.\n\nPS: Some of the secrecy cards have great design and they are highly playable even without the discout (though I would never put them in a deck with no chance of reaching secrecy).
