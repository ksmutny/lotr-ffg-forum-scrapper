But it doesn't say that. You are actually assigning the damage from the attack directly to a different enemy.\n\n \n\nI'm not so sure about this. To excerpt the Core rules:\n\n \n\n> To resolve an attack against an enemy, a player follows these 3 steps, in order.\n> \n> 1. Declare target of attack, and declare attackers.\n> \n> 2. Determine attack strength.\n> \n> 3. Determine combat damage.\n\n\n\nAs Firefoot or Azain's Response do not really do these things, can you really say that the secondary enemy has been \"attacked\"? I am sympathetic to those who said that it's just assigning damage as a collateral effect of the attack, rather than a part of the attack.\n\n \n\nAnother situation where this matters:\n\n \n\nThrashing-Tentacle.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Watcher-in-the-Water/Thrashing-Tentacle.jpg]\n\n \n\nSeastan's viewpoint contends that triggering Firefoot to assign damage to this tentacle would trigger its Forced effect. I read the situation differently: What does Firefoot do? There's a conditional trigger (\"after attached hero attacks alone\"), a cost (\"exhaust Firefoot\"), and an effect. What's the effect? \"...choose a non-unique enemy engaged with you. Excess damage dealt by this attack is assigned to the chosen enemy.\" It would be different if the effect were worded, \"...make an attack of strength X against a non-unique enemy engaged with you (ignoring its defense), where X is the excess damage dealt by the initial attack.\" But as is, you're choosing an enemy and assigning damage to it, not attacking it. The fact that the amount of damage is directly related to something that happened in an earlier attack seems not relevant to me.\n\n \n\nI think the fact that Firefoot happens to use the phrase \"this attack\" is more a \"clarification\" rather than an indication that the damage dealing is supposed to be considered a part of the attack proper.\n\nEdited October 8, 2016 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231362-azain-can-be-triggered-several-times/?do=findComment&comment=2449078","commentId":2449078,"userName":"shosuko","timestamp":1475993134,"content":"I think the assigning damage from these effects is not part of the attack.  My reasoning is that it is a response, and while it does \"assign excess damage from this attack\" as others have said, it does not state it is an attack, or an extension of the attack, it only calculates the amount you get to assign from the attack result.\n\n \n\nI would say the same ruling applies to the Morgul Bodyguard - if you attack a captain, and you had an effect like \"When you attack an enemy give them -2 shield.\"  If you attacked a Captain, even though the Morgul Bodyguard takes the damage, the attack was not against the Morgul Bodyguard, so you would lower the Captain's defense and apply it towards the attack.  If you killed Morgul Bodyguard vicariously through an attack on a Captain, you would not be able to trigger Azain's ability.  The attack target is not changed, you simply change where the damage goes.\n\n \n\nConsider it similar to Song of Mocking in reverse.  If I attach Song of Mocking on Gloin and steal damage that would have been dealt to another character that doesn't make Gloin the defender of the attack.\n\nEdited October 9, 2016 by shosuko"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231362-azain-can-be-triggered-several-times/?do=findComment&comment=2449340","commentId":2449340,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1476028842,"content":"Azain not triggering on the bodyguard still doesn't feel right to me.

It says \"participates in an attack that destroys an enemy\". That text does not require the attack to have been targeted at that enemy, only that an enemy was destroyed as a result of the attack. With Firefoot, I was uncertain if that counted*. But with the Bodyguard, who is redirecting the damage from the attack, it seems clear to me that the attack destroyed the Bodyguard, so it would trigger Azain.\n\n \n\n* But since Azain can only trigger once per attack no matter how many enemies that attack destroys, as PocketWraith correctly pointed out, Firefoot turns out to be a moot point: if you're triggering Firefoot, then Azain has already managed to trigger his response by destroying the first enemy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231362-azain-can-be-triggered-several-times/?do=findComment&comment=2451631","commentId":2451631,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1476190072,"content":"I wonder though...

But if there ever was an indestructible non-unique, I think that this BGG thread [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/846630/indestructible] would become relevant. In it, the question came up of whether you can place excess damage beyond Durin's Bane's total HP (since he's indestructible). And the response from Caleb Grace was \"You can place more than 27 damage on Durin's Bane.\"\n\n \n\nTherefore, I conclude that when you're attacking an indestructible target, there is no such thing as \"excess\" damage. \"Excess\" damage is the damage tokens you have left to place when the enemy is destroyed. So even if FFG ever releases a non-unique indestructible enemy, Firefoot will not be able to trigger off attacks against that enemy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231362-azain-can-be-triggered-several-times/?do=findComment&comment=2451912","commentId":2451912,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1476199388,"content":"> Since Firefoot requires a non-unique enemy, and all enemies with Indestructible are also unique, it's a moot point.\n\nI think you may have gotten a bit crossed up here: Firefoot just requires the enemy that it itself is targeting to be nonunique, not the originally-attacked enemy. So the situation can indeed come up in extant scenarios.\n\nFWIW, the term \"excess\" hasn't really been defined in this context AFAIK, so until an official ruling, I can see going either way.
