We will also be creating at least one complete cycle, including a deluxe expansion, six adventure packs, and an overarching narrative that delves into the history of a fan-favorite region of Middle-Earth.\n\n \n\nIn short: the game is not dead.

Custom cards frequently have either too much power or too convoluted abilities, but these seem well placed. Thengel seems strong, especially if the cycle comes with enough cheap Warrior allies that can discard themselves (or some other trait that has a lot of powerful expensive cards---warrior was my first thought). Fortunately Rohan doesn't have too many high-value high-cost allies.\n\nIs there a rules distinction between \"After a player discards an ally from play\" and \"After an ally is discarded from play\"? Is there intended to be?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312742-a-long-extended-party-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=4019751","commentId":4019751,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1606244340,"content":"> 54 minutes ago, NathanH said:\n> \n> Is there a rules distinction between \"After a player discards an ally from play\" and \"After an ally is discarded from play\"?

I'll take a look into this, and if necessary we can reword Thengel to avoid this rules question from popping up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312742-a-long-extended-party-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=4019832","commentId":4019832,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1606250172,"content":"Some encounter cards effects (like the treachery Knife in the Back or Secret Cultist or one of the quest stages of Wastes or Eriador) simply state \"discard an ally\" instead of \"player discards an ally\", so it can make a difference there. The intent of the card is clear but the wording can be interpreted as if it's the encounter deck who is making the discard.\n\nI think there are also some treacheries to that effect in the competite play quests (like  where is the opposing team that chooses and discards the ally. Still a player doing the discard, but that's also a possibile point of contention."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312742-a-long-extended-party-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=4027175","commentId":4027175,"userName":"TrueLolzor","timestamp":1607504048,"content":"I would recommend against using iconic named characters from other franchises for art, like Elspeth from MtG here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312742-a-long-extended-party-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=4027872","commentId":4027872,"userName":"robc73usa","timestamp":1607615615,"content":"will we be able to purchase ? meaning I dont print them lol"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312742-a-long-extended-party-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=4027920","commentId":4027920,"userName":"Bobbymcbobface","timestamp":1607623830,"content":"@robc73usa [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/231798-robc73usa/] The expansions are not going to be available for purchase, as they are fully volunteer created expansions.
