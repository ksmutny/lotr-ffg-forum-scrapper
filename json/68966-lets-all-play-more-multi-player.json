Sometimes I'll play two-player, but only with my wife. She is way less into it than I am, so this week I did some searching, and sent some totally out of the blue PM's to people, and I played today at one of our local stores with a total stranger. We got beat pretty good by the nameless things in Foundations of Stone, and then stomped by Massing. He was a really nice guy, and even though we didn't win once, I had a great time. Also learned to play a bit of CoC for the first time.\n\nThis wouldn't have happened if not for the random emails I sent out.\n\nLets start getting together more. Send out play invites to total strangers. Solo play is always fun, but multi-player, with another player just as into the game, was really great!

I agree they would not make it close to the mount doom. The point was as also explicitly said in the books when they formed the fellowship of the ring, that a small group going by land would be hard to discover. Fleet of Eagles would be hard to miss.
