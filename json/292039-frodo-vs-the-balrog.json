Another is to build up a super-defender with a lot of defense boosts and readying and using them to block all of the Balrog attacks. Beregond is particularly suited for this - Hauberk of Mail + Gondorian Shield puts him to 7 defense, and you can make that 8 with a dunedain warning.\n\nWhen I ran this the last time, I actually used a hero with a massive hit point pool (I used Lore Glorfindel with the boon Skilled Healer, plus Ent Draught, Elven Mail, Vigilant Guard, and some Ring of Barahir combos to get up to 16 hit points) and just took the Balrog attacks undefended, healing him up again with Athelas or ally Elrond."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292039-frodo-vs-the-balrog/?do=findComment&comment=3645635","commentId":3645635,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1552355408,"content":"Healing Herbs also works for that purpose."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292039-frodo-vs-the-balrog/?do=findComment&comment=3645637","commentId":3645637,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1552355662,"content":"> 1 minute ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> Healing Herbs also works for that purpose.\n\n Also true, but the action of an Imladris caregiver or warden of healing is easier to sacrifice than the action of a hero. And with all the condition attachment burdens in that quest, I liked athelas better. But for a quest with less conditions, I'd definitely look at the herbs"}]}
