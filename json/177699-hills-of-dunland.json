I'm just wondering: does the effect on Hills of Dunland from The Dunland Trap trigger for each player if you both draw a card? I'm assuming that when cards are drawn it's a simultaneous thing, especially if it's from a card effect or something. The text reads: \"Forced: After a player draws any number of cards, discard the top card of the encounter deck, if it is an enemy put it into play with that player. This ability does not stack.\" Am I wrong with how card draw works? Is it more that the first player draws, the effect resolves, then the second player draws?Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177699-hills-of-dunland/?do=findComment&comment=1633267","commentId":1633267,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1432363436,"content":"It says, \"after a player draws...\" not \"after the players\" so it would trigger for each player. This is true even if the players all draw at once since you can have multiple triggers at the same time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177699-hills-of-dunland/?do=findComment&comment=1633272","commentId":1633272,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1432364125,"content":"Yeah, that sounds right. I did play it like that, but for whatever reason I just kept re-reading the card trying to figure out if I had done it right. Thanks."}]}
