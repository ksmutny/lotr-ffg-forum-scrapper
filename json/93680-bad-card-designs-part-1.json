They come to mind quickly when I see two newer cards from the Against the Shadow cycle, Map of Eärnil and Steed of the Mark. And these new cards are what I call \"well-designed\" but their only problem lies in the cards above which make them bad tactical choices.\n\n \n\nIf you compare Dwarven Tomb to Map of Eärnil, the former is just better. This I could accept in an inter-spheral comparison but not within the sphere. Dwarven Tomb costs what Map of Eärnil does at its best (not taking into considerations wild coop combos like Desperate Alliance). Tomb is also an event which makes it easier to play. And it can recover any Spirit card, not just events. Finally, it can successfully recover response events whilst the Map can only recycle action events.\n\n \n\nPlayers with long experience tend to fear power creep. This above is an example of the opposite when there is a new card that is way, way inferior to an old one. Does inferior means better design? I would say so in this case, because the Map is perfectly playable, recycling cards like Elrond's Counsel, The Galadhrim's Greeting or Stand and Fight can be very useful, so there seems little arguing that the Map is not strong enough. And that in itself is a good argument for the Tomb being too strong a card. And the fact it only appears once in the core set is no salvation.\n\n \n\nThe other comparison, Unexpected Courage and Steed of the Mark. This one may be even more extreme. Steed is cheaper by 1 but to use it, you already lose the resource advantage the first time you use it. Then, the use is way more limited, with the Courage a hero can do any two actions, be it quest, combat or ability. With the Steed he can only quest and do one more thing (afterwards). This is already a huge difference but it goes far further. For some reason the much more able card, the Courage, has no restrictions, and can be played on any hero, whilst the Steed can only be attached to Gondor or Rohan heroes.\n\n \n\nNow, is the Steed good enough? Well it is not an obvious winner but I feel it can be super useful. As they say in the preview, for one resource you make any Gondor or Rohan hero a Core Aragorn, not bad. Plus, soon we might see some Mount synergies coming from the partly Rohan cycle. So where's the problem, you see it, the Courage.\n\n \n\nSolution? As much as I hate to say this, it is errata. Far less potent cards have got it already, so here's time now for these two. Hope others are with me, and ffg are reading...\n\n \n\nWait, to say errata is not enough, right? We need to know how to shaft them. It is not easy but for the Courage, I give two solutions. The first is in accord to what core set card distribution does. Why not print \"Limit 1 per deck\" on Unexpected Courage. I wouldn't say unique because it doesn't make much sense, thematically, and the designers have been very good with those, maybe save Light of Valinor which also makes little sense being unique (but it helps keep the balance of the power of the card). The other solution could be the cost though I wonder if errata ever goes that way, having a text missing or added is one thing but having something else printed is a bigger problem - unless we finally get the reprint of the cards changed by designers after we had bought them.\n\n \n\nAs for Dwarven Tomb, I think it is even harder here. I wouldn't want this to become another Dwarven synergy card as we have gotten quite too many of those already. Limitation on the cards it pulls could also be a trouble: if it only works for allies, it would be probably inferior to Stand and Fight. However, it could only work for attachments, after all the thematic ground of this card could be the Book of Mazarbul. So yeah, this is where I would go: dig the grave for a Spirit attachment.\n\n \n\nPlease, share your thoughts if you feel like...\n\nEdited November 18, 2013 by lleimmoen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911158","commentId":911158,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1384766569,"content":"I agree that some of newer player cards are inferior compared to the old ones.\n\n \n\nI think the problem is that right after Dwarrowdelf Cycle, developers got really concerned with power creep and decided to ton everything down, which resulted in this situation.\n\n \n\nWe've seen some crazy powerful during Dwarrowdelf Cycle.\n\nI'm still unsure what was the process between development of Zigil Miner and Stargazer and their (well Zigil Miner's) errata.\n\nIt wasn't even an unforseeable card interaction; they were working as intended... it's just that their intended use broke the game's resource system 5 minutes after they were released.\n\n \n\nEven though there were no Dwarf heroes or very little Dwarf allies during Dwarrowdelf Cycle, most Dwarf power houses relies on cards from that Cycle.\n\nWe are not Idle and Lure of Moria in same Cycle? Not to mention Legacy of Durin which has potential to (and very often) draws half a dozen cards in single phase.\n\n \n\nNot to mention Spirit Glorfindel, who was clearly meant to be used with Light of Valinor and became single powerful hero by far.... to abuse Elrond and Vilya you atleast had to eat high threat cost of 13, price you 'paid' for abusing Spirifindel and Light is 1 threat per Glorfindel questing if you couldn't manage to find Light of Valinor after Glorfindel quested 7 times.\n\n \n\nThen we have Against the Shadow Cycle, where almost every card is designed to be outshined by old cards (with exception of Outlands)\n\nEven the iconic hero like Boromir had his ability split into the card itself and an attachment that came out 6 adventure packs after.\n\n \n\nIt's almost like designers are so afraid of power-creep we are having power-crawling-backwards.\n\n \n\n \n\nAs you suggest in this thread, series of simple yet effective errata on bunch of old cards may be solution (example I could think of would be make Gondor trait requirement for Steard of Gondor, not added effect), but as a forgetful guy I wish FFG would take another, more difficult path to solve this solution; controlled power creep, boosting power level of 'weak' cards to be roughly same as 'powerful' cards... but that process will probably take another Cycle or two and one slip-up and we would be in worse situation than we are currently in."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911208","commentId":911208,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1384779866,"content":"I find your last paragraph excellent.

Maybe, but if you followed this game, you'd know it happens quite regularly, whether you find it fair or not.\n\n \n\nWhat I find not fair is creating two cards that do the same thing, one being clearly better than the other.

Make the Steed secrecy 1, and it's an excellent choice for most spirit decks.

The game should be healthy. I don't buy the stuff like \"if you don't like it, don't play it.\" I pay it, and I want to play it by the rules, and I want the rules to make sense.\n\n \n\nThanks Leptokurt, you might see you contradict yourself there, first saying UC needs no errata, then that you could not imagine playing with three copies of it. But this is the case exactly. In a tournament settings - and this is really no hypothesis - it is too late to be saying to your \"opponents\" that they should be of good sport and use a single copy of UC. Even if each of them only has a single copy of the core set, they would have two copies of it for coop. In the end, you basically agree with what I wrote: \"Limit 1 per deck.\" They really could have gone that way from the start: making the cards than only came once in the core set limited as such."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911286","commentId":911286,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1384789676,"content":"> Errata is a 4-letter word.

It may be that some of the older cards are a bit too powerful (and I know that spirit Glorfindel is pretty OP), but they do not break the game.

The errata that has occurred in this game has been based on issues where combos were broken. Beravor was not intended to be allowed to draw out half the deck in a single round for a big Protector quest play, nor was the zigil dwarf guy intended to rack up a ton of resources for a huge 1-turn trick win option. Errata was necessary on those cards due to the fact that the designers were unable to account for every possible manipulation.\n\n \n\nWhat you are asking for is far different. You want older, better cards to be neutered to accomodate weaker design options. As someone who owns three core sets, I don't, and I resent the implication that it's necessary to punish people who want to use 3 copies just because Caleb made a weaker concept in an encounter pack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911546","commentId":911546,"userName":"Kassad","timestamp":1384809122,"content":"If you plan on playing in tournaments things like card balance, the FAQ, and errata should concern you.  You should want them to keep cards too far from average out of the environment.  If you are going to a tournament, and you absolutely have to have 3 of a card in your deck no matter what sphere you are playing it probably needs a nerf.  If you are going to a tournament and there is a hero that every single team shows up with that hero probably needs a nerf.  If you go to a tournament and every team/individual is playing the same archetype it probably needs a nerf.\n\n \n\nIf you are playing at home your attitude should be more along these lines...\n\n \n\ntumblr_m0w9a1IhKu1qjhjdwo1_500.gif [http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0w9a1IhKu1qjhjdwo1_500.gif]\n\nEdited November 18, 2013 by Kassad"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911550","commentId":911550,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1384809311,"content":"Hmm, one of the reasons, if not the reason for Beravor being able to draw so many cards, was Unexpected Courage.

The problem with this game seems to be in some step of the design process, where a card like Zigil Miner becomes one of the best resource generators in the game (not only the sphere), obviously unintended. But the interaction with Imladris Stargazer or Gildor is too obvious to consider it anything other than a mistake. The same goes for Beravor. Master of Lore was probably errated to avoid any future infinite loop. But once they are released, I shouldn't rush to change their text.

Sure there are some cards that are stronger than others but if you tinker with deck and card combos for a while you will eventualy find a super-strong combo and because of this many cards get collateral damage, like Thror's Map i just hate that its action can only be done in the travel phase but the combo of it with Path of Need was the thing that got it errated. Master of Lore also suffered this with that crazy Erebor Hammersmith deck that came a while ago. But on general i don't have problems with super powerful combos because i like to make thematic decks (really thematic) and it is rare to find such combos with themwd decks (Dain is an exception but i don't use him and Outlands need the support of many other cards to make it work so it is not entirely thematic)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=911783","commentId":911783,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1384832949,"content":"Why is Gleowine a minstrel but Rivendell Minstrel not?

I do not want to punish anyone, I want to reward those who buy the game. I want them to have both Dwarven Tomb and Map of Eärnil as viable options, same as the Courage and the Steed; not just one of the two (and the other in case you don't find anything better for your decks than the fillers). It is the main reason, and I will not say it again, I feel every card should have its place, or at least a chance for it. I don't even mind Power of the Earth even though it is probably super weak - but there is no similar card that does the thing better - within the sphere.\n\n \n\nYes it is true. You didn't ask that Steed or Map be made better; you want the other cards to be made worse. Where would it end? Warden of Healing is better than Daughter of Nimrodel; a number of cards are just staples in their respective spheres.\n\n \n\nIn a game with an ever-growing pool of cards, there are going to be great cards, there are going to be average cards, and there are going to be bad cards. It's just how it is. I would love for all of the cards made for this game to be viable options, but the truth is so few of the cards are really playable in a \"best-deck\" situation.\n\n \n\nI apologize if I respond a little strong, but I've seen poor, knee-jerk reactions made off random message board posts in other games like this before because no one took what was happening or being complained about seriously."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=912645","commentId":912645,"userName":"Boris_the_Dwarf","timestamp":1384908146,"content":">  \n> \n>  \n> \n> I'm interested in this.

At least, it wasn't listed in the OP article of games stores can host events for. I have a way to make the game competitive but it has never been tried.\n\n \n\nThis is the tournament concept I have been working on. At the start of the event, the judge announces which scenario will be used. Two two-player teams sit down at each table. Each round is one hour, with the amount of time for each time evenly split at 30 minutes.\n\n \n\nThe teams roll off to see who will play their quest decks first. The other team is the \"shadow team.\" Proceed with normal setup, have the first team draw six cards, and when they are ready to begin, the shadow team draws 3 cards off the top of the encounter deck. Once during the staging step, the shadow team may play one of the 3 cards instead of revealing an encounter card. The shadow team has 10 seconds to decide to play a card.\n\n \n\nWhen Revealed effects trigger as though the card were revealed from the encounter deck. If an encounter card requires players to search for a card, the shadow team may replace 1 search with 1 card that matches the requirements of the search. During the combat phase, the shadow team may assign any of the cards in their hand as the shadow cards to eligible enemies. At the end of the combat phase, the shadow team puts all of the cards in their hand on the bottom of the encounter deck and draws 3 new cards.\n\n \n\nScoring is based on the following system:\n\nAdd up final threat totals, and subtract the result from 100. Then add 5 points for each damage token on a hero, and subtract 1 point for each ally in play. The team with the lowest score wins. Tie breakers are determined by which team took the least amount of time to complete the quest. If a team feels the shadow team is intentionally stalling the game to run them out of time, the quest players should immediately call for a judge to report a slow play concern."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=912941","commentId":912941,"userName":"Emrad","timestamp":1384952317,"content":"Reading this topic, pretty thouroughly, I realise many commenters miss a very important fact : This game is new.\n\n \n\nYes, card games have existed since more than 20 years now, but the way LOTR LCG works is totally unique (and remains the only one in its category).\n\n \n\nWhen you design a whole new game, there obviously will be some flaws and OP interactions that occur and were not intended.\n\nIf you've played MtG, you know what I'm talking about when I say Mox, Lotus, Tolarian Academy...\n\n \n\nEarly mistakes are normal and are being corrected on quaterly basis (more or less), this is more that we can hope for, other designers wouldn't be so active.\n\n \n\nWhen it comes to the topic of bad single card designs, I don't agree Maps and Tomb are badly designed.

Well, the Steed can be attached to Théoden on round 1, and be used on round 1 - something which would hardly be possible with the Courage. And yes, the round 1 can change the whole thing with Théoden's extra action available.

While it is true that Steward of Gondor is unique, it is so powerful, and has zero drawback, so it seems to be putting a serious downward pressure on any repeatable or attachment-based resource generation for other traits.

At the same time, I would prefer a metagame where Steward of Gondor was not quite so powerful, and there were other Leadership options for Dunedain and Noldor - just as there are for Dwarves with Thorin, Gloin (both versions) and We are Not Idle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=919746","commentId":919746,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1385796549,"content":"I think the easiest fix, indeed, would be if Steward of Gondor required the Gondor trait (instead of giving it). It has been said many times, and it would be a very nice thematic way to prevent it from appearing in every deck. Gondor would have then been quite unique already (not that it isn't in a way, but it would be more)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=919845","commentId":919845,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1385817683,"content":"Another point I would like to make for Steward of Gondor is that in multiplayer it can be beneficial if you build your decks in a specialised manner.\n\nFor leadership, in our group, that means you are the one responsible for all other players having enough ressources to play around with. In that regard, leadership has some abilities to move ressources away from their own heroes and onto the heroes of other players.\n\nBy having SoG be unique that means that, even though it produces +2 ressources every round, those ressources have to be split among other 1-3 other players.\n\nJust a small point that I think bears mentioning"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=927505","commentId":927505,"userName":"JSGosselin","timestamp":1386697257,"content":"This is the perspective of a casual player that plays the game for fun at home, but that follows every rule and every errata to the letter. House ruling would kind of ruin the gaming experience for me. I find this thread really interesting and I like the ideas that are being discussed. It convinced me to sign to the site to give my 2 cents hehe.\n\n \n\nI think we should wait to see what the traits of  Map of Eärnil and Steed of the Mark will have to offer with the new cycle before jumping to the conclusion that these cards are weaker version of Dwarven Tomb and Unexpected Courage. Imagine if you had an ally that would allow you to search your deck for any Record card when played from you hand (like the Rivendell Minstrel for songs), that would be an added advantage of Map of Eärnil over Dwarven Tomb. Of course, this is just an example. What I mean is that Unexpected Courage and Dwarven Tomb are great Core cards, but their power is somewhat set in stone, while Map of Eärnil and Steed of the Mark, with their traits, still have a potential to become great cards in the future.\n\n \n\nAs it is now, I run with both Map of Eärnil and Dwarven Tomb and kind of like the combo to be honest. Being able to use Map of Eärnil to use a discarded Dwarven Tomb to put any Spirit card into my hand, and put back Dwarven Tomb into my deck is kind of sweet I think. And I am not even mentioning that I could fetch back my Map of Eärnil with Second Breakfast if needed since it is an attachment.\n\nEdited December 10, 2013 by JSGosselin"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=927551","commentId":927551,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1386700415,"content":"Here's one major difference between the Map and the Tomb...\n\n \n\nWith the Map, I believe you can grab and use a Response event from your discard pile - like a cancel card - in response to a just-triggered effect.  The Tomb is an action, so you would need to have used it before the event you need to cancel.  This came up in a game for me and cost us a victory.\n\n \n\nIt may be costlier, but the Tomb has its uses.  This assumes that the Tomb can in fact be played that way.\n\n \n\nAnother point I'd like to make is that \"weaker\" versions of existing effects are not useless because they provide additional opportunities to use these great effects.  Imagine a 3 cost \"Steward of Gondor\" variant.  Who wouldn't pack those in their deck along with the original - just sayin."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=927557","commentId":927557,"userName":"JSGosselin","timestamp":1386700789,"content":"> With the Map, I believe you can grab and use a Response event from your discard pile - like a cancel card - in response to a just-triggered effect.  The Tomb is an action, so you would need to have used it before the event you need to cancel.  This came up in a game for me and cost us a victory.\n\n \n\nI think it is an Action to discard the Map and use it.

The reason is simple: the trigger has already passed. For example, take A Test of Will. Because the Map of Earnil is an Action, the window for responses to the When Revealed effect of a treachery has already passed. If you trigger the action on the map, the response window has closed for the When Revealed effect on the treachery.\n\n \n\nActions start a new effect chain (which may or may not then have subsequent response), whereas responses are always made in reaction to the appropriate trigger. When a trigger happens, you have to perform any and all Responses immediately. Once any player performs an action (assuming actions are even allowed at that step in the phase), the window for responses to that particular trigger is closed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93680-bad-card-designs-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=928224","commentId":928224,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1386779396,"content":"Welll, if one day we would get a card that has a reaction that allows you to immediatly play an action, we could use a Map's action to trigger the reaction of an event card in the discard pile."}]}
