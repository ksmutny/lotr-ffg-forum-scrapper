I am tired of building cool thematic decks that only let me down substantially in the quest phase because I haven't added Rohan and that damned Sister-daughter of Theodin.  Any other solo players feel my pain?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I LOVE this game, but I want another good questing option outside of Eowyn!  If I want to win consistently, I play Eowyn. If I want to have fun tricking out different themes outside of Rohan, well, I usually always lose. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56178-solo-games-need-more-help/?do=findComment&comment=555073","commentId":555073,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1321046107,"content":"Have you considered running Glorfindel ? (Lore, with 3 WP) and pumping with  Celebrian's stone (Leadership) for an extra 2 WP.

I also made this deck last so it got a bit of the short straw when it comes to certain events."}]}
