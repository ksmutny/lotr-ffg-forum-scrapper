I was playing my Dwarf Lore deck (Using Gloin, Bifur and Benavor) and my brother was playing my tactic deck (Brand, Legolas and Thalin). We got off to a shaky start because he failed the first locate test because my brother didn't want to discard his cards from his hand so we had to raise our threats by 7. However after that we kept the staging area clean and never had any of the lost effects triggered.\n\nFor being \"The Long Dark\", I thought it was weird that it was only two quest cards and being a 7 didn't make much sense. We fought some pretty nasty enemies but with Thalin (Which is a must include) we managered to take them out during the round they engaged us. Anyone else have a easy time with this quest?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=636452","commentId":636452,"userName":"livingspeedbump","timestamp":1338068820,"content":"Yeah ive played it three times in the last few days, once solo and twice with 2 players (each different people).

Double mulligan doesn't bode well, then Crebain sits in the staging area, meaning Undisturbed Bones hits Arwen for one. Pathless Country comes up as Shadow Effect, killing Arwen for a turn 1 loss. Heroes are defeated.\n\nRoad to Rivendell\n\nTactics/Spirit and Dwarf decks\n\nSeven threat in the staging area after setup makes things look tough, but parties manage to quest successfully, even clearing a location and travelling to another.

This is a short report…\n\nI take the three Rohan heroes I had mentioned. I get Follow by Night for set up, does nothing. Quest with Arwen and Éowyn, get Knees of the Mountain, discard useless Arwen (player card), place 5 progress. Travel to the location. Play Ancient Mathom and Horse-breaker next round. Staging is Undisturbed Bouns, kill the Horse-breaker, place 2 pt on the location, 4 on quest (total 9), nothing in the staging area. Play the Riddermark's Finest and Gondorian Spearman, quest with the two girls only again, staging is Bitter Wind, I lose some resources (four or five in total I think) and place seven more resources (after playing Elrond's Counsel), the threat is back on 26. Play Escort from Edoras but only quest with the girls again, staging is Goblin Taskmaster, I kill him with Hail of Stones (exhausting Horses, Escort, Spearman and Dúnhere), part 1 done, Goblin Gate enters play. Play another Horses and Ancient Mathom, quest with the two girls and 1 horses, staging is Followed by Night again, Goblin Gate finished, 3 cards drawn, 3 pt on the quest. Play West Road Traveller, quest with three girls now, staging is Orc Ambush, Taskmaster enters play from the discard pile, part 2 finished. I engage the Taskmaster, Spearman defends, leaves, Háma and Dúnhere finish the job, Háma exhanges Hail of Stone for another copy of Arwen. Staging area is again clean. Play another Traveller, quest with the four girls, staging is Sleeping Sentry which I cancel with A Test of Will. Had I not had the Will, I would have lost the two Travellers but were still half-way done, this way I only had 3pt left. Played nothing, staging was Orc Raiders, game finished.\n\nI am not sure if this is lucky way for the things to go, I think the deck is very much suited for such a quest, even though I have not onced used Dúnhere's ability and only once Háma's. And the two have only attacked once. I haven't drawn Feint but having had drawn two copies of Ancient Mathom was quite lucky I guess, especially as there were exactly two locations in the entire game.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very good example of a quest which is much easier solo than 4 players for instance. Also, it is a good example of a quest where Éowyn still seems super strong whilst Dáin could get killed early. Even if I could not use the player card Arwen, having the objective made playing Elrond's Counsel much easier.\n\nHope this helps, Dam, in your future experience with the quest…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=636550","commentId":636550,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1338110832,"content":"RtR = secrecy scenario\n\n-> Bilbo + Théodred"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=636557","commentId":636557,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1338112006,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\n \n\nTry Road to Rivendell with low threat beginning, actually try going under 27 at the start so that none of the baddies jumps at you in ambush.

My decks are pretty much what they have been since I first put them together. Naturally weaker CS cards and AP cards have been dropped as better cards have come out and even a few heroes have been swapped here and there, but the basic structure (and idea behind them) is the same as it was.\n\nI have five decks (from 2 Core Sets), which, when paired up once with each other decks equals 10 plays per quest.

And doubtful I'll bother revisiting any of the completed quests either.

One is a \"when revealed\" treachery that deals 2 damage to every single character (from both players!) if the starting player fails the location test. The other one is a location (threat 3/4, depending on the adventure card), that requires a location test to put progress tokens on it.

In fact, there is a long history in card games of very powerful cards that are designed to only work in a handful of decks and nowhere else. This is cool and in fact can lead to interesting decks as the designers can encourage deck builders to make strange decks.

I just trying to say this will be better for the game.\n\n\n\nI think part of the problem is accommodating the difficulty needs of different \"tiers\" of players within the same quests. The quests are trying to cater for the play level of relatively new players with smallish card pools, and at the same time for seasoned players with honed decks and access to all the cards.\n\nOne potential design solution to this problem, building on Glaurung's idea of \"advanced rules\", would be to build \"difficulty levels\" into each quest. I think this could be accomplished quite easily, by keeping the encounter deck the same but printing two sets of the quest cards, one for \"standard\" difficulty and one for \"advanced\". The \"advanced\" quests would (say) place additional cards in staging at the start (one of the key points that makes a quest difficult or easy in my view), require significantly more questing points at each stage, and/or place additional restrictions on the players (like the Dol Guldur \"only one ally\" clause, the RTM extra threat gain, etc).\n\nI think this could work because:\n\n- everyone understands and would be comfortable with the concept of \"difficulty levels\"\n\n- it could be done by printing only a small number of additional/duplicate cards (the quest cards)\n\n- it would keep the story and overall design of each quest the same\n\n- it would give double the challenge and play experience to newer players - tackle the basic level and then move up to advanced when this has been mastered\n\nOn the other hand, it looks like part of the problem is that the designers/playtesters are not capable of properly assessing the difficulty of quests. To put it bluntly, if the playtesters assessed TLD as being on the same level as Dol Guldur or Return to Mirkwood, then those playtesters are not very good. Or it may be that the designers are not listening to what the playtesters tell them. Either way, the outcome seems to be that FFG are trying to meet the need for more challenging quests, but are not succeeding in doing so at the moment."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=641361","commentId":641361,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1339041804,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\nNarsil0420 said:\n\n \n\nJust wanted to get back to the OP.

But unfortunelly there is no other Lotr card game at the moment now so i keep play this one.\n\nlet look on the last Cycle:\n\nHunt for Gollum - is ok. Not goof noy bad just ok.\n\nConflict in the Carrock- Really easy quest  in my opinion not worse difficult 7\n\nRhosgobel- yes this is good one. Really hard and interesting.\n\nHills of Emyn Muil- this quest is the big shame for Designers. Really disasters\n\nDead Marches- interesting idea but in the end very easy and boring quest\n\nReturn to Mirkwood- This one is cool. Really ok.\n\nMassing In Osgiliath- the best quest ever. Why we dont have other quests on the same level?\n\nKD- is not really difficult but anyway increase difficult of the game and bring new mechanic. Good job.\n\nRed horn Gate- Very good quest. interesting mechanic and what ls really important get more difficult on the second and last quest step.\n\nIn my opinion good Example of difficult level and interesting idea.\n\nRoad to Rivendel- Very big dissapointed. Really easy and stupid. Ambush sound cool as a mechanic but in play is quite boring and no dangerous at all.\n\nWatcher in the Water- IS ok. Good quest. Cannot say is amazing but is not bad too.OK\n\nLong Dark- Just get it. Sound not to diffiucult and sure not worse difficult level 7.\n\nSo this is my vision of the game.\n\nInstead to make great quests and make the system where the players can increase or discrease difficult level they create very cool (in theory) game but really most of the quest is not really good. Lazy designers or FFG leaders is dont care? Anyway there is no other Lotr card game so people will play anyway right?\n\nCose we love this world and we like to touch it again.  But in My opinion ME CCG was much much better and Decipher game also.\n\nIn my rating:1 ME CCG, Second Decipher game and last place for Lotr FFG.  \n\nSo what we need to make this game bettter? Better quest more difficult and more fun, Better balanced cards and really much more hard work of designers. I know many players dont agree with me but this is my position.

Maybe that is not actually bad but as I dislike deckbuilding specifically for quests, I am not a fan of this. I also dislike a quest like this because the games tend to be very similar, rush through it, find an Athelas or two (or not even if you have a copy or two of Lore of Imladris) and be done with it. You don't get to use the combos you've got in your deck, you don't build on the strategies you'd prepared, you don't boost the heroes, you just want to be done with it as quickly as possible because each new round makes the table red.

Most of what we have seems to be fairly easy stuff like Emyn Muil, Hunt for Gollum, even The Long Dark, which so far has been pretty easy for me, as well. Or you get Dol Guldur, Return to Mirkwood or Massing At Osgiliath, which are extremely difficult. There seems to be little middle ground.\n\nThe problem, I think stems from the amount of difficult encounter cards in a deck. In the tough quests, you get tough card after tough card. In the easier ones, you have one or two cards that can really hurt and that's it. Sometimes, like in Gollum, cards have to form a combo to be of any real threat. I just think that scenarios could be created where encounter cards can be more balanced towards a certain amount of toughness overall without them being all brutal or mostly harmless. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=641493","commentId":641493,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1339066697,"content":"thats a good point titan…..expanding on that - certain encounter sets are brutal, some arent- the wilderness ones with the trolls in is brutal as it has nasty locations/ treachery/ enemies\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=641830","commentId":641830,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1339128789,"content":"Agreed - though Wilderlands also features in some of the easy quests such as Carrock and Dead Marshes, so I don't think this is the whole story.\n\nI feel that one of the key factors that distinguishes the hard quests from the easy ones is this: the staging cards you are confronted with at set up. The \"norm\" is one staging card per player. Those quests that give you more cards than this (or specifically dangerous cards) are generally the tough ones. Those that give you less are often the easy ones.\n\nExamples: Anduin (Hill Troll), Massing (multiple enemies who will attack you), Dol Guldur (three cards in staging plus other crippling restrictions)\n\nExamples of easier quests: Carrock and Rhosgobel confront you with just one innocuous location in set up.

It doesn't have to be a deadly one like Hill Troll, but something that prevents a player from questing like hell. Like those goblins in KD that will kill you, if they're undefended.\n\n2) One thing I liked about Redhorn is that some of the nasty cards are only shuffled into the encounter deck suring the second stage. Why not creating an adventure that includes different encounter sets for each stage (=level)? First stage includes rather easy cards, second one cards more deadly and so on.\n\n3) I love cards that have a printed value of X, in which X is the number of allies.\n\n\n\nyes that i always try to say wnen i  mean more Difficult and interesting. Cose most of the quest very monotony. If there is no many cards with surge once when you clear the staging area finish game get boring cose 90% you win the game. And if is happen on the first quest card is really stupid feeling. Cose you still whole adventure to play with feeling nothing can destroy you. IS is not Boring??? But when quest is build up like RHG or MIO or KD quests ( lot of surge cards and with second and third quest card is going to be more dangerous) is really interesting to play cose you cannot predict what happen and every time game can change same like pvp against reall opponent.\n\nAslo i sure we need some encounter cards who should to react on current status of felowship and make more damage if felowship more strong( lot of allies Atachments and so on). Also i really like KD encounter cards idea if encounter card effect do nothing ( in the case like: remove all progress tokens but there no any) cards get surge.

What has happened to me is that I\"ve used the Torch to get rid of a location that has come up in set up. This is a large encounter deck which means that the likelihood of enemies coming up due to the Torch's effect is minimized. Of the 60 cards, 21 are enemies. That's roughly a 33% chance that one will come up due to the effect. If this happens, you will have nothing in the staging area on the first turn, prior to the encounter deck revealing a card. Compare this to The Watcher having two cards in staging and then revealing a third one, and you can see the difference. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=642466","commentId":642466,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1339291652,"content":"Just tried the following experiment against TLD: play with three heroes (Glorfindel, Eowyn, Core Aragorn), and a deck of fifty blank cards (i.e. I only used the cards to discard for Eowyn and for locate tests - did not play any attachments, events or allies).

Booored already opened another thread in which he complained about the fact that it's possible to win the game with all/most enemies still alive. And he was right to do so. What we need is more Carrock! 4) Enemies should have high threat values, like that Cave Spider in TLD, so that a player has a reason to fight them. Right now it is to easy to keep your threat low enough so that enemies won't engage you, while you can bring out more WP than there is (additional) threat in the staging area. Glaurung is completely right that once the staging area is empty it's not very difficult to keep it clean.

Card is cool, powerful sure. Too powerful? Maybe but…… I r think we already have a lot pf players cards in the game too powerful! \n\nAnd Fast Hitch is not top in this list in my opinion. You talking about Fast Hitch is to powerful? Must to be unique? Ok but what about Beravur ability : is worse once per turn errata…… U courage also why not unique?\n\nYes i think you right should be unique……..\n\nAs i say before:  situation can change the real tournament system with new rules and Restricted cards list. There is already a community playing this game more then 1 year. And we need optimal challenge we already past the beginners level right?\n\nMy main point if we get cool, powerful player cards give us really cool difficult quest and powerful encounter cards. Otherwise is boring.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=643004","commentId":643004,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1339420878,"content":"Sure they could have made a different card (theme and name) to make it unique but with cards like Unexpected Courage or Fast Hitch it would go against all logic to make them unique because how could a knot or an emotion be so?\n\nWhat they easily could have done was to limit Beravor's ability to one per round.

Things get better when Snowbourn Scout shows up, slapping a progress on it. Burning Low adds another 3 threat, but thanks to Cave Torch, it is cleared, although a Goblin Follower is discarded. Good thing though, since now it can be engaged at will, so Scout blocks it and dies, allowing Imrahil to ready and hack the Follower down with Legolas. Quested for 7, got 4 progress (Goblin Sneak also showed up), then Legolas's kill for a total of 6/13.\n\nTurn two, Escort from Edoras joins the fray, as does Erestor, quest for quite a lot more, Abandoned Mine shows up, along with another Goblin Sneak. Cave Torch clears Mine, then Shadow of the Past used to put it to the top the Encounter deck, so only one card needed to pass the locate test for 2B. Legolas kills one of the Goblin Sneaks, 2/17 progress, empty staging area.\n\nTurn three, Escort returns via Stand and Fight, Theodred gets Celebrian's Stone, parties quest. Goblin Follower (haha) revealed, engages, so no threat added, then The Mountains' Roots. Pathetic 2 threat in the staging area vs 17 willpower, didn't even need to use Eowyn or Protector of Lorien to boost questing to complete the stage.\n\nI think the most I've spent on stage 2B is three turns, one-turned it quite a few times. Maybe, like in the second game today, where I got 14/17 progress on 2B the first turn there, if you get Vast and Intricate and fail the locate test, wiping out all your progress, it could buy the Encounter deck enough time to get you. Then again, in that second game, I got back to back Massing in the Deep during 2B and still breezed through."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64884-does-the-long-dark-deserve-a-difficulty-rating-of-7/?do=findComment&comment=647282","commentId":647282,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1340260315,"content":"For long time i didn play coop games cose my partner was away for a while.
