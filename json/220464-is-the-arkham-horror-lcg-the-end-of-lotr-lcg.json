Will they cancel a game of that magnitude just because another game came? My guess is no.\n\n \n\nTrue, but popularity is not the only consideration.\n\n \n\nThe most obvious blockage would be an expiration of their license, and an inability to extend/renew it. I'm sure FFG would be willing to offer quite a bit of cash to keep the LotR license, but that's not a guarantee they would succeed.\n\n \n\nAnother thing to consider is the rate of new fanatics. Although there are many new players catching the LotR LCG bug, and there will always be new people who will go all-in and want to get all expansions, it's a simple fact that the longer the game goes the fewer people will be willing to go all-in. Some people see a massive game as exciting, while many others see it as demoralizing.\n\n \n\n\"What, you mean there are over fifty expansions - or more like 100 counting nightmare decks? And I'd basically have to get them all to fully participate in the metagame, understand what the podcasters are talking about, and be able to make most of the decks listed online? Ug, overwhelming. Pass.\"\n\n \n\nIn addition, even the hard-core fans can eventually reach their limits. Every cycle, there is another wave of people deciding they've had enough, and they stop buying. Or their buying dramatically reduces.\n\n \n\nShadows of Mirkwood and Dwarrodelf sell like hotcakes. Against the Shadow does fairly well, but is noticeably less. And I bet every cycle thereafter has a decrease. They still sell a lot, of course, but new players are simply less likely to buy later expansions. And LotR isn't the greatest game for jumping around in your purchases. Sure, it can be done, but you're going to have a pretty rough time with many of the later releases if you don't have a bulky card pool of earlier ones.\n\n \n\nAt some point, FFG has to ask themselves whether the continuing drop in activity is worth the expense and effort of putting out more expansions. Even if they do the math and decide a new expansion won't be worth much, they will likely still continue to do so for a while simply because new people are more likely to buy at least a little bit for a game perceived to still be supported. But at some point, even that won't be worth it.\n\n \n\nJust to be clear, I have zero reason to believe LotR is anywhere near its end. I'm just pointing out that popularity alone is not guaranteed to mean the game will continue. They could be selling a million core set boxes a month, and it still wouldn't be worth putting out more expansions if only a small handful of dedicated fanatics were to buy it.\n\nEdited August 4, 2016 by JohnGarrison1870"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2234245","commentId":2234245,"userName":"FetaCheese","timestamp":1464187255,"content":"Well theme is a curious beast to tackle but I still think it can be done if we keep things a bit open ended. LOTR LCG is supposed to be taking place before the actual story of the books, so that there is leeway to deckbuilding and questing. Similarly a First Age expansion could have thematic leeway by being not exclusively recreating the stories, or by presenting them in a different fashion (e.g. being retold as tales). There could even be a seperate First Age box that is individually playable out of the box (like its own little core set) but still plug-and-play with the other expansions.

Arkham Horror LCG will sell very well.  Arkham Horror the Board Game is one of their longest running and successful lines (this we not with 100% certainty) and there is a pretty big built in fan base.  The fact that they are making an LCG should come to the surprise of no one, it's really a wonder that it took them so long to make one.\n\n \n\n2. Lord of the Rings is already 5 years old, that is a nice run and really the only unfinished business it has at this point is the next cycle and the completion of the Saga expansions.  I think it's safe to say they will wrap up both before they discontinue the line which would give the game a sense of completion.\n\n \n\n3.  FFG is not stupid, if a game makes money they will continue to produce, if it doesn't they will kill it.\n\n \n\n4.  FFG has a reputation for continuing support via reprints well after a game is discontinued.   Some good examples are Warhammer RPG and Game of Thrones 1st edition (still in print today despite 2nd edition release).\n\n \n\nSuffice to say Lord of the Ring card game fans have nothing to complain or worry about.  It has been a successful run of a great game, the fact that it will be discontinued at some point is enevitable and there is currently enough content released today to play the game indefinitely.  We know that there will be some more content coming out in the form of at least one adventure cycle and the completion of the Saga expansions, I think this we can count on.\n\n \n\nAll and all the release of Arkham LCG probably marks a point at least where some evaluation will take place of LoTR but we can always hope that the game is still popular and profitable enough for FFG to continue the line.\n\n \n\nFor those playing competitively (event stuff), typically long after a game ceases to be officially supported, events continue as long as there are people willing to show up for them so the reality is that Lord of the Rings the Card Game will live on as long as their is a fan base sufficient to support it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2340367","commentId":2340367,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1470221816,"content":">  \n> \n> 1.

I don't see that many games which are still good overall after five years of churning out (almost) monthly expansions. Sometimes they should have stopped at the first set!

I am a not-so-new player, I just finished the Against the Shadow cycle and I am playing now my first Saga (The Hobbit - God I wish I could have Beorn/Foe-Hammer/A Very Good Tale/Cram when I was exploding my nerves against Perir in Pelargir and Into Ithilien!). I don't own any GenCon nor Nightmare packs. And I do want to buy / play the 6 other saga expansions out there, and voice of isengards, and the lost realms, and the grey havens, and the sands of harrads.

You also already play several solo games so it isn't like you are trying to find a main game to play on your own.

Perhaps I should have been more explanatory and said this in that other post originally but how negative you were being right off the bat was frustrating so I didn't feel like breaking it down that much for you. Also you didn't respond to myself or even Crusader Lord who did a really informative write up of the game and solo play just for your benefit.\n\nI don't really understand what sort of reaction you thought you were going to get being so negative and dismissive about this game on its official forums?

MageKnight and Eldritch Horror/Mansions of Madness are just too big, I've played so much Elder Sign my box LOOKS like an ancient tome, but cards (yes, even a lot of them) are fine.  Sorry for being so cautious but I realize that this game represents a significant investment, and I tend to not do things in half-measure so I'm being really careful, but I DO see real potential in it.  I appreciate your help and in return will at least give it a shot up to the point that you recommend if you can tell me if those fears are justified or not, or if the game's expansions corrected those initial impressions that sadly most reviewers and teachers of the game seemed to convey.  Many thanks again for your help and understanding!  : )\n\nEdited October 27, 2016 by xodarap"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2476726","commentId":2476726,"userName":"xodarap","timestamp":1477556294,"content":"> wow dude, John was just trying to help you.

You aren't a tolkien fan, seem to have a massive grudge against the game to begin with and have multiple concerns about it so I was trying to give honest feedback/advice. For many people the main draw of this game is the IP and you have zero interest in that IP. You also already play several solo games so it isn't like you are trying to find a main game to play on your own. This game is extremely time intensive because deckbuilding is such a major part of the game so if you already play several other solo games you might not have time for this one if you don't absolutely love it. Perhaps I should have been more explanatory and said this in that other post originally but how negative you were being right off the bat was frustrating so I didn't feel like breaking it down that much for you. Also you didn't respond to myself or even Crusader Lord who did a really informative write up of the game and solo play just for your benefit.\n> \n> I don't really understand what sort of reaction you thought you were going to get being so negative and dismissive about this game on its official forums? This game is definitely not for you. Go back to the Arkham forum. Also solo games definitely seem like a good fit for you as you clearly do not play well with others!\n\nI don't have a massive grudge against the game.  I have an admitted ignorance of how it actually plays.  Can you \"mutiquote\" or whatever anything negative I've said about it?  Concerns?  Definitely!  Anyone about to invest as much as I will would as well, that's common sense!  Caveat Emptor are not words lost on me....after being burned by multiple game companies, they're ones I LIVE by.  Where did you give any advice about the game?  All you recommended was a reading list....a FICTIONAL one at that!  I didn't come here for a reading list my non fiction one is what makes me crave a break so I game while I let my mind grind through everything for a bit which is tough enough, I don't want to ADD to that!  Where are these informative posts?  Seriously I don't get responses to my posts so I must have honestly missed them and I'd like to read them.  I'm not looking for a \"reaction\" to anything but the GAME.  I don't live here, OR on the Arkham forum.  The only negative thing I said was about a game that looked like a toybox that threw up, and that's because it did!  Worse, it looked like it threw up on my beloved MageKnight!  (but I left that part out since I didn't want to be negative.)  OOps.  Look, I'm just trying to make a buying decision that represents a huge investment. Since your SUCH a keen investigator you may have noticed that I only post what?  Every coupla' YEARS.  So if you don't mind, I apologize if my honestly and directness have offended you sensibilities but I really AM just trying to make a decision here so if you can help - Great, I'd love that!  You ARE the people with the most experience.  However, if you're just trying to criticize or argue since you have nothing better to do (specifically apparently not this great solo game I've heard so much about.) seek elsewhere. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2476731","commentId":2476731,"userName":"xodarap","timestamp":1477556634,"content":"> The worst part of this is that then people over at Discord and the podcasts crap on all the forum saying that we're all doomsayers and that we're always saying the game is dead when in fact everyone here knows it's not except for afew very vocal ******.\n\nI haven't said anything bad about your game Gizlivadi, I only stated that I can't buy it anymore, which is true, and I have a chance to buy it now so I'm doing research on it.  That's it.  I just want to know which bits to buy, should I buy it at all, and if it's worth the considerable investment or should I just wait for Arkham Horror.\n\nEdited October 27, 2016 by xodarap"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2476732","commentId":2476732,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1477556668,"content":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232744-buy-or-wait-decision/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232744-buy-or-wait-decision/]\n\n \n\nBottom of this thread."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2478941","commentId":2478941,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1477666848,"content":"Got to play a demo of it yesterday.  It is very very cool.  The card upgrades after completing a quest is interesting.   We played a 4 player game and got through 2 scenarios.

really love MageKnight a huge favor and tell them about YOUR game.  LoTR is \"Card based MageKnight.\"  I'm not saying they copied each other or anything like that, I'm saying they deliver the same \"feel\" and require the same level of thought and offer the same unbridled sense of adventure particularly if they have not experienced LoTR before due to inexperience or even because they may not like Tolkien's works.  In my case, I'm completely ignorant of the setting due to simply being MORE into Lewis, Assimov, Stackpole, Weiss-Hickman, and Anthony before segueing into 100% non-fiction.  So for me it's even better because every single CARD is a new discovery of something beautiful or challenging.  Regardless of theme, LoTR is a jewel that shines all on it's own. \n\n \n\nSo there you go, a massive untapped vein of players who would love LoTR but don't even realize what it really IS.  Now back to that \"Cult of the new\".  That is the real reason my FLGS doesn't have any LoTR, it's not a concentrated effort to bury LoTR it's just short sightedness on the part of my FLGS and a focus on what's upcoming and hot and thereby should take that shelf space that should really always be

they will like from a selection of great art and interesting ideas.  Or y'know you can just let them be \"blinded\" by Destin-!!!! OhwowItotallyforgot!! \n\n \n\nUh, yeah so in summary LoTR is great and has a lot of potential to increase it's fan base, Arkham Horror is an EVOLUTION, not a replacement, Visibility will determine

results of my intensive research from the second one:  First, LoTR isn't and likely will never be \"dead\". for the same reasons my favorite game, MageKnight, will never be \"dead.\"  It's playable solo, is a masterpiece of balanced and compelling mechanisms, is a different game with every adventure, the rules systems, while being very tight and make sense, tend to have an undeserved reputation that would make politics blush in spite of the fact that you have them down after a couple of plays, and anyone who has played it and loved it, pretty much always will.   Why?  Well here's where you can do players who really love MageKnight a huge favor and tell them about YOUR game.  LoTR is \"Card based MageKnight.\"  I'm not saying they copied each other or anything like that, I'm saying they deliver the same \"feel\" and require the same level of thought and offer the same unbridled sense of adventure particularly if they have not experienced LoTR before due to inexperience or even because they may not like Tolkien's works.  In my case, I'm completely ignorant of the setting due to simply being MORE into Lewis, Assimov, Stackpole, Weiss-Hickman, and Anthony before segueing into 100% non-fiction.  So for me it's even better because every single CARD is a new discovery of something beautiful or challenging.  Regardless of theme, LoTR is a jewel that shines all on it's own.  So there you go, a massive untapped vein of players who would love LoTR but don't even realize what it really IS.  Now back to that \"Cult of the new\".  That is the real reason my FLGS doesn't have any LoTR, it's not a concentrated effort to bury LoTR it's just short sightedness on the part of my FLGS and a focus on what's upcoming and hot and thereby should take that shelf space that should really always be dedicated to a great game like LoTR, after all you can always find MageKnight on IT's shelf of honor, LoTR deserves no less.  Too bad most stores see it more as a \"hotness that was.\"  How do you beat that perception?  Visibility.  Play the game at your FLGS, try to buy it there even when you know you can't.  Let people see what it IS.  The art and subject will easily draw them in, and your explanations of the rules by allowing them to learn by seeing it in motion will get them past the worst hurdle.  I.E.: YOU play the super effective tactics deck while they play whatever they think they will like from a selection of great art and interesting ideas.  Or y'know you can just let them be \"blinded\" by Destin-!!!! OhwowItotallyforgot!!  Uh, yeah so in summary LoTR is great and has a lot of potential to increase it's fan base, Arkham Horror is an EVOLUTION, not a replacement, Visibility will determine whether LoTR becomes \"gamers little secret.\" or the next \"Ticket to Ride\" and I didn't mean to insult anybody.  Now if you'll forgive me, I must \"away\" because with all the research and discovery I let it slip my mind (Geez, speaking of limitless exploration and a constant evolution of skill and knowledge) that Xur's in town!!  ^ ^    \n> > \n> >  \n> \n>  \n> \n> Line breaks, mate, line breaks.\n> \n>  \n\nThanks, fixed.  I didn't have to be is such a rush anyway all Xur had this week was Bad Juju.  Not a BAD piece to be sure, but I don't need \"two cores\"  ^ ^"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2480901","commentId":2480901,"userName":"xodarap","timestamp":1477805004,"content":"I guess probably the shortest way to answer this topic is to say that Arkham Horror (and specifically the LoTR designer's presentation of it) is what got me IN to LoTR the LCG.  So while it may not be easy to get ahold of it's certainly not impossible.  When talking to a friend about it (since he really IS a fan) he didn't even know it existed and showed immediate interest.  So I think it still has a lot of untapped potential and that there is room for both it AND the Arkham Horror LCG especially with the departure of the GW license which, to be honest, I kind of mourn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2480937","commentId":2480937,"userName":"shosuko","timestamp":1477811680,"content":"> I guess probably the shortest way to answer this topic is to say that Arkham Horror (and specifically the LoTR designer's presentation of it) is what got me IN to LoTR the LCG.  So while it may not be easy to get ahold of it's certainly not impossible.  When talking to a friend about it (since he really IS a fan) he didn't even know it existed and showed immediate interest.  So I think it still has a lot of untapped potential and that there is room for both it AND the Arkham Horror LCG especially with the departure of the GW license which, to be honest, I kind of mourn.\n\nYeah - so much this.  I go to game shops pretty often, and I didn't hear about this game until just last year.  I'm certainly not going to stop playing when Arkham comes out.  I can do both ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2483592","commentId":2483592,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1478020458,"content":"> But lest we threadjack this too much, check out the Arkham Horror forums!\n> \n>  \n> \n> https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/forum/512-arkham-horror-the-card-game/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/forum/512-arkham-horror-the-card-game/]\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nBut I don't know those people.  I feel safe here.   "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2483616","commentId":2483616,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1478020982,"content":"The overlap in the thematic of both games is going to kill LotR.

The game is much less \"virtual\" than LOTR in that locations a not some far off place, but rather next door or at least nearby - which I like. It doesn't punish the combat player for having to pass a \"travel\" test to move on. (Well usually at least.)\n\nBut, but, there is an element that comes from the lore that means that the stories don't really end. There is not a sense of winning or losing the quest. There are multiple \"resolutions\" and that may be fine for some, but it just doesn't sit well with me I guess.\n\nThis game is more about success or failure of the overarching story, except that you can really screw yourself on the first quest with regards to the overall resolution by your initial choices. That's how the game is designed, and that's fine if that's what you want. I'm still not sure.

Absolutely.  However, with the split sphere deck building, it does mean you can make fewer decks.  But that should be a given since you are nearly doubling your card pool when you get the second core.  I think people are forgetting how you need THREE cores of LotR if you want a play-set of every card, and then you have trip sets of some really terrible core cards.  The same 3 core policy is in their other games as well if I recall, so 2 cores is a big improvement.   If they got it down to just 1 core, then the core would be nearly twice the price and would then lower the number of people that initially get into the game.\n\n \n\nWith two cores, you can build 3-4 decks.   If you build a Skids deck, I don't see there is enough good cards to balance out a Roland and Wendy deck since Skids can utilize the best from each sphere.   Wendy and Agnes can be build near mono-sphere and do really well.   "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2511279","commentId":2511279,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1479831592,"content":"Sloth - Your post indirectly channels something that's been bugging me.

Folks, there wasn't as much deck building in the early days of LOTR either.\n\n \n\nI think the deckbuilding lack comes into play when changing scenarios. Usually you'll earn 5-7 XP between scenarios, meaning you get to swap out and upgrade 2, 3, maybe 4 cards - so not a whole lot changes. In LOTR, you generally need a sideboard of about a dozen or more cards, and you'll be swapping out a good number of them between quests. One might require Condition control, the next you swap those out for Willpower boosts, the next you swap those out for a Siege quest, etc. I'll agree there definitely is deckbuilding in both, but in AH, once your deck is built, it's supposed to be fairly stable for an entire cycle of 8 scenarios."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2511355","commentId":2511355,"userName":"13nrv","timestamp":1479833590,"content":"I play LOTR since the beginning.

That's just way too time-consuming and for me not the enjoyable kind of deck building.

The downside is most easier quests tend to be a cakewalk, but I find it a good way to enjoy the storyline with leisure. My other deck-building fun is to build thematic decks for saga quests, and that is actually a MUCH more difficult and time-consuming project than simple power decks lol. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2512462","commentId":2512462,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1479886313,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > The criticisms I'm seeing of AH LCG appear to concern FFG's LCG model more than anything else - i.e. people are upset that you need 2 core sets to have a decent pool of cards, and as usual the box is awful.\n> > \n> >  \n> \n>  \n> \n> What do you mean the box is awful?\n> \n>  \n> \n> The 2 core thing is a given honestly.  You want a lot of cards?  Got to buy two cores.   Can the game be played - successfully - with just 1 core?

For example Pathfinder has a lot less art. However, taking all that in to consideration, the FFG games are cheaper:\n\n \n\nPathfinder Curse of the Mummy is considerably more expensive: Paizo are selling it for $59.99 (I can't stand the game by the way!).\n\nThe Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Mummy’s Mask Base Set includes more than 500 cards and 5 polyhedral dice.\n\n \n\nThunderstone Base is an older game with around 500 cards and some tokens but it does appear to go for around $60. Maybe $50 if you're lucky. I do enjoy this one, but it's nowhere near as good as LoTR.\n\n \n\nReleasing a companion set would certainly make a lot of BGGer's happy! I suppose it's all to do with BGG people only being a small part of the market, and FFG have probably looked at the economics of such a move and decided it's not worth it. Plus if I'm being cynical, obsessives will swallow their ire and just buy more core sets anyway as both you and I have done.\n\nEdited November 23, 2016 by JonG"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2513432","commentId":2513432,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1479938944,"content":"> as both you and I have done.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\n100%.  \n\n \n\nI've no idea what it would actually take - at a production level - to make the \"companion core\" that I suggest.  Considering that you need 2 cores to have enough tokens (or threat dials in LotR) for a 4 player game, the \"companion core\" would still need to include some amount of cardboard inserts and not just a collection of cards.  It's nice to think that it should be a simple matter of taking their existing card prints and redoing the layout of the print sheets to exclude all the unncessary cards, get those printed and get any extra cardboard things printed.  Get everything bundled and into a new \"companion core\" box, that they will need to design, etc.   It does sound easy, but that is time and money that they have to invest in, and sure, the \"companion core\" would sell well.  BUT - would it sell any better than a second core already does without the additional investment from FFG?   I'd guess not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2513448","commentId":2513448,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1479939872,"content":"It's really about designing a core game around the ~$40 price point, which is what I assume FFG's marketing team has determined to be the optimal cost for an unplanned purchase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2513472","commentId":2513472,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1479941026,"content":"I wish they would just do a 40$ \"Starter\" edition, and 80$~ \"Full Starter\" edition for ppl like me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2513547","commentId":2513547,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1479945985,"content":"> > as both you and I have done.\n> \n>  \n> \n> 100%.  \n> \n>  \n> \n> I've no idea what it would actually take - at a production level - to make the \"companion core\" that I suggest.  Considering that you need 2 cores to have enough tokens (or threat dials in LotR) for a 4 player game, the \"companion core\" would still need to include some amount of cardboard inserts and not just a collection of cards.  It's nice to think that it should be a simple matter of taking their existing card prints and redoing the layout of the print sheets to exclude all the unncessary cards, get those printed and get any extra cardboard things printed.  Get everything bundled and into a new \"companion core\" box, that they will need to design, etc.   It does sound easy, but that is time and money that they have to invest in, and sure, the \"companion core\" would sell well.  BUT - would it sell any better than a second core already does without the additional investment from FFG?   I'd guess not.\n\nI still like the idea of the first deluxe actually being a second core, with duplicates of whatever cards were 1-ofs in the first core but not of anything that already had enough for a full play set.

Problem solved for that game  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nLotRLCG feels just fine with one core and the collection of cycles I have. AHLCG seems less casual (disregarding the vast number of expansions both will have), in that it almost requires players to have their own sets of cores and deluxes. LotR is safe from this tentacled new upstart.\n\nEdited December 4, 2016 by evilidler"}]}
