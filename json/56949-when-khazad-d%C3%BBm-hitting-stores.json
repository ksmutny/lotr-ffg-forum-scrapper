But, I gave up on Amazon after the first two APs. They always stock late or mislable them (I remember Amazon labling some APs $17 and discount them to $15 *facepalm*). So I instead of that I go to FRPgames.com. They get those suckers the moment they're released (I think I got Return to Mirkwood before FFG store had it for sale lol). Khazad is $24 pre-order there at the moment."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56949-when-khazad-d%C3%BBm-hitting-stores/?do=findComment&comment=562805","commentId":562805,"userName":"Will Fuqua","timestamp":1322785421,"content":" Thanks for the info guys.  Hopefully it'll get released soon. I'm really looking forward to what new quests players make with the new encounter cards.  "}]}
