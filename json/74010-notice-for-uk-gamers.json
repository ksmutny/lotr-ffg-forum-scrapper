Thanks for posting this, Rich! Sad to see them go really - I've used them a few times in the past (ah, Khazad-dum!) but they were often the last to get stuff shipped out. I'd noticed they were having a lot of sales recently, so I suppose the writing was on the wall there, but it's never good to see someone go out of business like that. \n\nI can heartily recommend 13th floor for an alternative though! The stuff is usually full-price (though I've preordered some things that have been a little cheaper that way), but you do get free first class postage, and free stuff when you spend over a tenner!! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74010-notice-for-uk-gamers/?do=findComment&comment=720984","commentId":720984,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1352482926,"content":"yeah its a real shame that its happened…..especially when its a REAL game store, and not one of those that sells those computer game thingys.

A company whose registered address is a residential one, and whose capital is just £1? The word \"dodgy\" just doesn't seem to cover it. I really feel for people who have outstanding orders with them.\n\nEDIT - Wayland Games are involved too? There's a company I've mistrusted since it took them a month to acknowledge the fact that I had paid for an order they hadn't shipped, nor did they have the stock to ship.
