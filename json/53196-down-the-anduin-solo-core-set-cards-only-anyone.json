With so few cards in deck, it is easy to draw threat reduction and kill everything with Dunhere. Troll does not even engage you. Thanks to card \"reshuffle discard pile into your deck\" , you can play in stage 1B for hours, so before turning to 2B you can prepare powerful army and tons of Gandalfs in your hand.\n\nOf course, if Stand/Fight -> Gandalf is illegal, than this may be harder to pull off.\n\nsolo sprit deck is so powerful against this quest mainly because it has just 30 cards, so you pretty much draw everything you need. If you upgrade it to 50 as per rules, the quest is no longer piece of cake."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53196-down-the-anduin-solo-core-set-cards-only-anyone/?do=findComment&comment=528488","commentId":528488,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1316088106,"content":" I was able to do it with Dunhere, Eowyn, and Thalin.  Using most (if not all) of the core set Spirit cards and adding in some of the low-cost Tactics cards to get to 50 cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53196-down-the-anduin-solo-core-set-cards-only-anyone/?do=findComment&comment=528514","commentId":528514,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1316090857,"content":" I used spirit tactics to beat the first quest using Eowin, Legolas and I think Thalin.

I admit, it has become somewhat harder to do this, since you can't use Stand and Fight anymore on Gandalf.... :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53196-down-the-anduin-solo-core-set-cards-only-anyone/?do=findComment&comment=528855","commentId":528855,"userName":"KlAve","timestamp":1316148917,"content":"DurinIII said:\n\n Hey fellow Ringer!
