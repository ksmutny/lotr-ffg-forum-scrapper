You can do 2 games with the same deck, 1 you can win and the other one you can be trashed. If the encounter deck is against you, there's almost nothing you can do. Only the nightmare mode can prevent this, but it's long :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nBut with the extensions, some cards will help the resources & draw management, which are crucial. And so the decks would be more consistent and you will probably be able to win the 2nd scenario with a good ratio without Gandalf ."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46660-gandalf-the-great/?do=findComment&comment=467472","commentId":467472,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1305213035,"content":"Rashley said:\n\nLooking back over the notes I made of all the games I have played, and reading everyone else's reports, it is extremely clear that games are won and lost by the number of uses of Gandalf.\n\nI got that impression, too. It's not absolute, though.\n\nI have won one of my 12 games against the third scenario using two starter decks without Gandalf showing up: It was with the Lore/Spirit combination with Glorfindel being the prisoner and ended with a score of 93. However, two heroes died in this game (one of them killed by the Hummerhorns).\n\nI have also lost two of those twelve games despite Gandalf showing up once - both games used the Lore/Tactics combination, though, which I've identified as the most problematic.\n\nAll of my other wins in scenario 2 and 3 had Gandalf showing up from one to three times.\n\nIf you don't use cards from the Spirit deck, the only means to reduce threat is Gandalf, that's what makes him crucial for the other spheres. For every sphere but Tactics Gandalf is also often decisive to quickly defeat a foe by dealing four points of auto-damage. I think I only used him once in over 100 games to draw more cards and that was when playing the Lore deck to boost my Defender of Lorien.\n\nAdding three copies of Gandalf to a deck definitely makes the game easier. Having ways to recycle Gandalf or bring him into play additional times even more so."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46660-gandalf-the-great/?do=findComment&comment=467546","commentId":467546,"userName":"Primus_Magicus","timestamp":1305222140,"content":"@servant of the secret fire: I'm not sure if you know it, but the riversong ally is unique, so only one at a time can be in play"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46660-gandalf-the-great/?do=findComment&comment=467554","commentId":467554,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1305223067,"content":"Primus_Magicus said:\n\n@servant of the secret fire: I'm not sure if you know it, but the riversong ally is unique, so only one at a time can be in play\n\n\n\nYes  i know mate.I have three in my deck not in play but this guy has only one hit point and he dies immidiatly by  the wen revealed effects so i have three in my deck to replace the dead one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46660-gandalf-the-great/?do=findComment&comment=468085","commentId":468085,"userName":"Kallisti","timestamp":1305298276,"content":"The first deck I build was Green/Blue (sorry I forget which sphere is which) and I left the Gandalf's out due to their high cost.  (I'm a CoC:LCG player and most high cost cards are generally not used).  Anyway, I got through all three of the quests with this deck.  (It did take two attempts at quest three though).\n\nThen I sorted everything out, and made two decks, out of the starter box, and played a \"two player\" game by myself.  I put two Gandalf's in each deck since he seemed so good now that I understand the game better.  I've gone through the first two scenarios and haven't manage to draw him yet.  Soooo I think he's definitely good, but not entirely necessary.  We'll see what happens with quest three though.\n\n \n\n "}]}
