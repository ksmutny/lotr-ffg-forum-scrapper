It's not my native language...\n\n \n\nI am interested to know how you play this game.\n\n \n\nI guess some of you are interested to create a deck for each adventure individually. Your goal is to win every adventure and wait for the next one.\n\nOr create versatile decks that can win most of the adventures, and you replay the old ones with these decks. \n\nOr maybe, you like to create different standard decks and then, depending on the adventure, you play with one or another.\n\nOr you prefer search the web for a pre-created deck and use it in your games.\n\n \n\nAnd how you choose an adventure to play?, Randomly?, when it's released you play until you win it? you create a deck and play all the released adventures in order?,...\n\n \n\nPersonally, I do it as follows:\n\n- First, i choose randomly 10 different adventures. I decide what to play first and will play the others by release order.\n\n- Then, i select 5 combinations of spheres and 5 heroes randomly among the least played, i choose one heroe and one 1 combination and choose freely the other 2 heroes matching the combination chosen. My choice depends on the 10 selected adventures.\n\n- I create a deck thinking to win the most of the 10 adventures and the obligation to win the first one. If not, i remake the deck until achieve it.\n\n- Finally i write the stats (% wins, adventure scores, deck list, own rating,...) in an excel sheet, and start again: i choose randomly 10 different adventures, bla, bla, bla,...\n\n \n\nDoing this, I think the game becomes more replayable, and powers one of its main characteristics: decks building. Versatile decks (One deck for 10 different adventures), power decks (the winning of the first adventure is a must, and it can be very hard), thematic decks (depending on the difficulty of the adventures and the variety of heroes). \n\n \n\nWhat do you think? How do you play this amazing game ?\n\nEdited May 23, 2014 by sparrowpisuke"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106970-whats-your-way-to-play-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=1095541","commentId":1095541,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1400854414,"content":"I mainly play solo (normal solo, not retarded multi-handed) or with 3 players. What we do is play with \"decks\". IMO this is all about deck building. The game itself is very flawed but you can sculpt the player experience through deck building. You can make decks that will crush everything, or decks that fit a theme or weak deck to give you more a challenge etc etc.\n\n \n\nFor myself this is the crux of how I play. I see the cards and I think of a synergy that I feel would make a cool deck, build the deck.. then play it vs the quests.\n\n \n\nAs for quest selection... I tend to just pick the ones I have enjoyed the most. They come out so fast and so often and I play them as I get them.. but once I have a fun deck I like I usually go back and play my fav quests. Usually quests that do not require a deck specific  trick.. like say watcher in the water. So it isn't really random.\n\n \n\nBut yeah, if I had to pin it down I would say I am a deck builder. That is how I play the game, the quests are just places to test the decks and I play them all, but have my favorites.\n\nEdited May 23, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106970-whats-your-way-to-play-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=1095604","commentId":1095604,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1400857158,"content":"I play solo (multi-handed, not boring unbalanced classic solo :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )\n\n \n\nI play themed decks, and will think about how my band of heroes have come together for the quest, and specifically use allies, events and attachments that relate to one of the heroes in some way.  I build the decks with versatility in mind to be able to play through an entire cycle with little to no modification."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106970-whats-your-way-to-play-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=1095619","commentId":1095619,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1400857949,"content":"Solo is not unbalanced, it just has a different balance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106970-whats-your-way-to-play-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=1095666","commentId":1095666,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1400859949,"content":"> I play solo (multi-handed, not boring unbalanced classic solo :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )\n> \n>  \n> \n> I play themed decks, and will think about how my band of heroes have come together for the quest, and specifically use allies, events and attachments that relate to one of the heroes in some way.  I build the decks with versatility in mind to be able to play through an entire cycle with little to no modification.\n\nI play very similarly with two hands/decks and use the same decks for all quests with sideboards for both of them. I probably have less theme than you but try my best to keep my decks thematic whilst still powerful! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nLove to hear others playing in a similar way to me and advocating two handed play!
