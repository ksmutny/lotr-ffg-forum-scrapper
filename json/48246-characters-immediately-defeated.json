Can I save him by using action written on Glorfindel? There is written: Action: pay 1 resource from Glorfindels pool to heal 1 damage on any character. In the rule book is written: Any time one of these cards has 0 hit points, it is immediately defeated.\n\nThanx for your answer.\n\nDave\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48246-characters-immediately-defeated/?do=findComment&comment=483889","commentId":483889,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1307800521,"content":"No I don't believe you can use his action to save him. I don't have the rules section to quote but the \"immediately defeated\" would probably take precedence. If you had any foreknowledge of him taking that amount of damage, you can use his ability prior to recieving it, but if you took 5 damage all at once, there's nothing you can do about it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48246-characters-immediately-defeated/?do=findComment&comment=484177","commentId":484177,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1307878100,"content":"Yeah, sadly if a character takes the ttoal amount of damage that will kill them in one go, then there's nothing you can do (unless you can cancel shadows effects etc.) If it comes in two lots (i.e. from multiple attacks) then you have an action window to use the 'heal' ability."}]}
