Do you think i could beat it with the card pool i have? And one more Question, Out of all the Adventure Packs out there (and the duluxe ones too) If I would skip getting 3-4 packs which ones would be the best to skip buying. Like which ones provide the least helpfull cards, and boring senarios? It can be very expensive to buy all these expansions so i was wondering which are the best to skip and still be able to beat other hard quests?\n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80291-a-journey-to-rhosgobal/?do=findComment&comment=770569","commentId":770569,"userName":"Cutievalkyrie","timestamp":1362542647,"content":"Dont buy Hunt for Gollum cause Bilbo Baggins is weak…\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80291-a-journey-to-rhosgobal/?do=findComment&comment=770616","commentId":770616,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1362555785,"content":"Ok, but I would miss out on Dunedain Mark and Winged Guardian.  Those are pretty much the only good cards in that AP am I right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80291-a-journey-to-rhosgobal/?do=findComment&comment=770640","commentId":770640,"userName":"Captain Poe","timestamp":1362561071,"content":"The hunt for gollum is a hard quest. Bilbo isnt the best hero, but he has his uses, and with the up comming sets, it looks like hobbits will be getting some nice boosts (they already have access to fast hitch and dwarven armor which are both great cards. Fast Hitch + Dwarven armor + bilbo + burning brand is a great combo).\n\n \n\nAs for the quest, yes, you can beat it with that card pool. I beat it using just the core, THfG and CoTC cards. KD has some great cards which should mean you can definately do it.\n\n \n\nThe reason the quest is so hard (without spoiling) is because a few special abilities are key in order to really have any chance of beating it. If you don't have decks that have access to these abilities (which you will have access to them from your current card pool, it just depends on whether you build the right deck or not) then you can get slaughtered pretty easily.\n\nThat being said, it can be a fun quest, its just a really specific quest that requires a specific build… which means that you unfortunately have to really focus on building around it.\n\n \n\nIf you want more detail just let me know and I can go into more specifics. Have fun."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80291-a-journey-to-rhosgobal/?do=findComment&comment=770645","commentId":770645,"userName":"Valyrian Steel","timestamp":1362561233,"content":"I wouldn't really listen to Cutie there as there are really useful player cards in every pack. For instance THfG in addition to being a decent low-mid difficulty quest with tons of great theme has Winged Guardian and Song of Kings. I guarantee that you will find a couple interesting cards in every pack and some packs you just can't skip at all with regards to player cards.\n\nThe songs all come in different packs in the first cycle and cards like Burning Brand & Frodo (CatC), Boromir & Vassal of the Windlord & Fast Hitch (Dead Marshes), Dain & Eagles of the Misty Mountains & Support of the Eagles (Return to Mirkwood), Prince Imrahil & Haldir (AJtR), Gildor & The Riddermarks Finest (THoEM) are all useful. \n\nIn regards to your other question you should definitely be able to tackle Rhosgobal with that card pool as that was basically the available pool at the time the quest came out minus KD. The first cycle definitely loses some potency with the larger card pool that is available now and several of those quests seem very vanilla compared to the cool themes and mechanics we have now, but I still find them enjoyable and play them often.\n\nHope that helps!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80291-a-journey-to-rhosgobal/?do=findComment&comment=770675","commentId":770675,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1362564833,"content":"Thankyou for all the help guys, that is very helpfull.
