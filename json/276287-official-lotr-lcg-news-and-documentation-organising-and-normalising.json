I've spent a couple hours working on a site.  Mostly it's been proof of concepts (e.g., scraping html from HTTPS, extracting the article portion of a page, etc.)\n\nThe hardest part is deciding how to organise the navigation.  This is because there are multiple hierarchies to consider.\n\nThe first is By Release, which is more or less chronological.  So, Core Set first, then Mirkwood Cycle, etc.  This works fine until we get to the Saga Expansions, because then we have two branches: one for Sagas and one for non-Saga material.  If someone is trying to follow a strictly \"progression style\" fashion (for both opening packs and reading documentation), then it's unclear what the correct \"progression\" order is once the Sagas got started. \n\nThe second dimension is By Article Type.  I haven't read all the articles yet (or else there would be little motivation for this project), so I can only assume that the types of articles are along the lines of: announcements, spoilers (which act as trailers), strategies, dev diaries, roadmaps, etc.  It seems like it would be useful to group those articles as well, independently of the By Release ordering.  Or maybe not.  I just don't

you would split up the LotR saga, interleaving it with the other expansions based on date of release?\n\nIs that mostly to stick with a more truly chronological ordering?  Or do you think certain scenarios in the LotR saga be either too easy or too hard (or lack certain thematic cards) when playing \"progression style\", considering the player cards made available by the other packs released concurrently with the saga?\n\nFor example, would the following orderings be unbalanced (or lack thematic cards) when playing progression style:\n\nOPTION A:  (too hard?)\n\n  [...]\n  Celebrimbor's Secret [MEC30]\n  Antlered Crown [MEC31]\n  Black Riders [MEC32]                 <-- saga packs start when first one was released\n  Road Darkens [MEC34]\n  Treason of Saruman [MEC45]\n  Land of

indicate order of release.)\n\nI guess another question would be how to group the Standalone packs.  They, like the sagas, are somewhat independent of the main timeline.\n\nDo you think the Standalone packs also become too easy or hard if they are played out of sequence with the main scenario progression?\n\nFor example, would Massing at Osgiliath [MEC15] be too easy if playing with all cards

And then there's \"Deluxe Expansion\", \"Cycle\", \"Dev Diary\", etc.   Obviously, each article could have more than 1 tag.\n\nThen we have cycle-based grouping.  For example, it would be nice to give articles about The Long Dark a \"Dwarrowdelf\" tag.  But then what about Khazad Dum articles?  Should they also get a \"Dwarrowdelf\" tag, even though they are not really part of that cycle?\n\nAnd even if we find a clean way to assign cycle tags to articles, we'd need to find a way to display the cycle tags themselves in a specific order.  So , there's a bit to think about there. \n \n\nThanks for the list of articles. \n\nI am curious: do articles tend to be about one expansion at a time?  Or do they sometimes talk about multiple releases at once?\n\n \n\n(I think perhaps my next task is to actually read a bunch of articles so that I can more familiar with the scope and taggability of each article)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276287-official-lotr-lcg-news-and-documentation-organising-and-normalising/?do=findComment&comment=3361121","commentId":3361121,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1528194785,"content":"WTF?!

The POD usually represent a documented part of the history of the middle earth so it is easy to find the date.

another question:\n\nWhich would you rather see:\n\na) an FFG-centric site which focuses on organising FFG's official LotR documentation (articles, FAQs, instruction PDFs)... with little or no references to \"unofficial\" information (e.g., card FAQs, blogs, videos series, etc.)\n\nb) a more general LotR LCG information site which highlights FFG's official documentation but also provides links to the \"best of the best\" unofficial documents, sites, and video series.\n\nThe goal of either site would be to provide a very focused set of information about the card game to people who are still learning it (or are new to specific cycles).  So, it wouldn't try to provide a comprehensive list of every LotR resource out there, as that is a constantly moving target and we have Google and the forums to help us track that.\n\nAs for the 2 options, a FFG-centric site would be easier to implement, navigate, and maintain (since it would only need to keep track of what FFG is publishing on its own site), and it wouldn't seem to \"play favorites\" or hurt anyone's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, I am unsure if FFG's documentation is sufficient to stand on its own.  Are any of the unofficial resources so \"must-have\" that their omission would hinder the learning process, and thus devalue the site? \n\nAnd do we even care about the \"value\" of the site?  Do we care if it's a \"read once and never come back\" resource, or if it becomes a full-fledged community-driven \"learning centre\" where users can add and upvote their favorite unofficial resources, or post their decks for expert criticism, or do the same with videos of their gameplay, or even play a browser-based version of LotR LCG which is a true 1-to-1 computer translation, which is what we've been craving for all these years? \n\nAs you can see, it's easy to get carried away when thinking about an \"ultimate LotR LCG\" site.\n\nBut then we need to think about the time involved... and that's why we haven't seen such a site yet.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276287-official-lotr-lcg-news-and-documentation-organising-and-normalising/?do=findComment&comment=3367855","commentId":3367855,"userName":"Wandalf

still thinking about this project.  Coming up with ideas for how it can be done simply, but still add value.  There are a lot of LotR LCG blogs and sites out there!  So if I'm going to sink time into

is a nice idea, and I've done those before, but I am worried that if I open up a wiki to user contributions, someone will just come along and mess things up, either intentionally or accidentally.

I don't really look this aspect for the same reason I'm not really looking to thematic fit in LOTR ^^.\n\nHaving article from many Blogs and other website will be a HUGE add, since FFG article are really poor on strategical concern (not really what I ask from them anyway). But at the moment you put some there is no reason to put only a few. And it can be really complicated to do it in any other way than using a wiki. That is why it would be a good idea for me. Good time to create a LOTR LCG wiki, it could growth to something way more ambitious than only listing articles from other sources because, despite your fear it make wonderful things to let people speak about what they like ;)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276287-official-lotr-lcg-news-and-documentation-organising-and-normalising/?do=findComment&comment=3389572","commentId":3389572,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1530277620,"content":"As far as I know, there are at least 2 different (english) wikis which focuses on the lore of the books.
