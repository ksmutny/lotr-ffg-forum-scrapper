The you phrased it here it sounds like you were thinking only one per action window, which is not the case. The number of times you can take an action in a given action window is only restricted if it says it is."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100094-grimbeorn-the-old-conflict-at-the-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=1492839","commentId":1492839,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1426552445,"content":"Just to add a little more:\n\n \n\nIf Oak-wood Grove [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/conflict-at-the-carrock/oak-wood-grove-catc] is the active location any resource tokens from any hero can be spent as leadership resource tokens....\n\nEdited March 17, 2015 by CJMatos"}]}
