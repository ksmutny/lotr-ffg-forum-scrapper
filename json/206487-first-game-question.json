We used the tactics and spirit decks from the core set to do the first quest. Had a great time but I'm sure we made some mistakes. I died at the end but my death bought him the time needed to kill Ungoliant's Spawn. There were still enemies in the staging area and the ones that killed me would be going back there next turn. Did he have to defeat them too to win the game? We lucked up and got the 3b quest that didn't have a cost to beat but said you had to find and defeat the spawn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206487-first-game-question/?do=findComment&comment=2120002","commentId":2120002,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1458734661,"content":"If the condition of the quest card is met (defeating the spawn), then you won. A lot of quest ask the players to defeat one particular ennemy to win.\n\nWelcome to the game! And be prepared for the next 2 quests of the core set : they are difficult."}]}
