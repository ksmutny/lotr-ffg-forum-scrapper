Deal 2 damage to that character.\n\nAnd Black Uruks,\n\nThe first player must choose and discard an attachment from a questing character, if able.\n\nDoes the character have to belong to the first player? Or is it a character belonging to any player? I guess a literal reading means its any character but I just wanted to make sure.\n\nMany thanks.\n\nBen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69039-first-player-chooses%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=672942","commentId":672942,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1344844367,"content":" It's any character."}]}
