Assume you are using one deck, which means no more than 3 heroes and no more than 3 copies of each card. The deck can be as large as you'd like, though.\n\n2. No saga or encounter cards may be used, though player encounter cards are fine. Exception: you're free to assume there is one Eastern Crow in staging, one engaged with you, and one engaged with another player just to give you your choice of targets.\n\n3. Assume that you've been playing the quest for arbitrarily long and have set everything up exactly to your liking. This means any number of cards in hand, any number of cards in play, any number of cards in your deck (in any order-- assume you just dropped a Gandalf's Search), any number of resources, any threat level, etc.\n\n4. No using cards whose bonuses are potentially unlimited. This means no Keeping Count, no Lay of Nimrodel or Gondorian Fire, etc.\n\n5. No Grave Cairn, just because.\n\n6. No recurring any cards from your discard pile, because otherwise this becomes a game of \"pick your favorite infinite loop\". I'll make an exception for 3x Lords of the Eldar, because that's the only way to play it.\n\n \n\n \n\nI've got an answer that I think is fairly optimized, but I'll hold off a couple days before posting it in case anyone else wants to give it a shot first.\n\n \n\nEdit: @sappidus [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/251007-sappidus/] reminds me that Grave Cairn only counts printed attack, so it's back on the table. I mostly just didn't want to turn this into a dwarf-counting exercise.\n\n \n\nEdit #2: a much simpler way of stating rule #6 is that no card can be played more than 3 times except for Courage Awakened / Noiseless Movement / etc, which can be played four times. (Because otherwise you just infinitely loop your attack buff of choice.)\n\nEdited October 17, 2018 by Some Sort"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284715-rosie-cotton-destroyer-of-worlds-a-thought-experiment/?do=findComment&comment=3507033","commentId":3507033,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1539810407,"content":"I did just runthrough of the cardpool, so I could optimize this a bit more, but is your answer above or below 6,000?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284715-rosie-cotton-destroyer-of-worlds-a-thought-experiment/?do=findComment&comment=3507035","commentId":3507035,"userName":"Some Sort","timestamp":1539810537,"content":"I'm well below that.

Am unsure.)\n\n \n\nHigh-quality jank that didn't make the cut:\nOriginally I included Tom Cotton and played all of Rosie's stuff in one planning phase to give her Friend of Friends and Cotton's +2 attack bonus.\n\nAt one point I replaced Tom Cotton with Sam Gamgee and used Desperate Alliance to pass away Galadriel, opening up Strength of Arms to ready Faramir three more times.\n\nAt one point I committed Rosie to the quest alone so I could trigger Scouting Party three times, then used Late Adventurer to commit Faramir (to take advantage of Elwing's Flight) and Ally Arwen (to give Faramir sentinel). This got scrapped once I switched to Sword-thaining Faramir.\n\nAt one point I was unsure of how Herugrim worked and whether it would be legal to bring in another copy using Open the Armory, declare another attack with Hands Upon the Bow, then trigger it again for another bonus. (I don't think this works, but if it does we should be able to get over 3,000 attack.)\n\nAt one point I considered ending the sequence by Bartering away Rosie's Sword-thain again to activate Sword of Morthond + Outlands bonus, but you lose more buffs by losing Hero status than you gain by gaining Outlands status.\n\nAnyone see any errors? Anything I overlooked that can push this even higher?\n\nEdited October 21, 2018 by Some Sort"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284715-rosie-cotton-destroyer-of-worlds-a-thought-experiment/?do=findComment&comment=3510435","commentId":3510435,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1540153867,"content":"Bartering is a planning action, isn't it?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284715-rosie-cotton-destroyer-of-worlds-a-thought-experiment/?do=findComment&comment=3510439","commentId":3510439,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1540154390,"content":"> 7 minutes ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> Bartering is a planning action, isn't it?\n\nIt is.

Add Vigilant Guard to Faramir's setup. During the quest phase you use three quick strikes on Beechbone (mixed in between the global readying effects), trigger his response each time, and move the damage to Faramir. This gets Faramir out of play for you and frees you up to Vilya another Sword-thain onto Rosie. Use a Gandalf's Search to stack one on top of your library instead. Put Faramir's Born Aloft on Beechbone instead and you stay under Strider threshold.\n\n \n\nThis gives you one less option for recurring Faramir, which costs you one ready.

Neat!\n\nVigilant Guard would be a better solution to killing off Faramir and Galadriel so you can keep the Songs of Mocking on Rosie for the WP boost. And using Beechbone instead of Treebeard lets you keep Elfhelm in your lineup for another +2 WP / +1 attack net on Rosie. (Also, Song of Hope is limited one per hero, so you can put one on Rosie, one on Galadriel, and one on Faramir without sacrificing anything.)\n\n \n\nNecklace of Girion is a good candidate to move via Long Lake Trader, though. That'd get me another +2 WP on Galadriel, which would get multiplied out to +16 attack on Rosie for a total of 1322."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284715-rosie-cotton-destroyer-of-worlds-a-thought-experiment/?do=findComment&comment=3510487","commentId":3510487,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1540157962,"content":"> 2 minutes ago, Some Sort said:\n> \n> Vigilant Guard would be a better solution to killing off Faramir and Galadriel so you can keep the Songs of Mocking on Rosie for the WP boost.

I don't think he can.\n\nCombining both should get you enough damage to kill Elrond as well after he's done with Vilya.

I never needed to kill off any other heroes to get under the Strider threshold.\n\n \n\nGood point about Strength of Arms. I had an iteration that used Elfhelm + Hero Sam + Galadriel before I was using Vilya to double-dip on Sword-thain, and I Desperate Allianced away Galadriel to open up Strength of Arms. If I used Treebeard instead of Elfhelm I could kill off Galadriel, Hero-Faramir, and himself, then Desperate Alliance away Elrond to open up Strength of Arms. The biggest problem is if you're triggering Faramir after Galadriel is gone (and presumably has already Nenya'd), you're not double-dipping on his willpower bonus.\n\n \n\nStill, swapping out Elfhelm (who gives +2 WP / +1 Att) for Treebeard so I can Strength of Arms for +3 WP should result in a +7 attack net. So 1329 attack."}]}
