You have to defend 6 boss level attacks in a row. Then if you don't manage to quest through on the next turn (which requires a minimum of 12), you immediately have to defend 3 more boss attacks.\n\nI'm just skipping over this one for now, maybe I'll look up a custom built deck later.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291379-the-three-trials-is-bogus-in-solo/?do=findComment&comment=3632329","commentId":3632329,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1550977333,"content":"I find it's much easier to beat if you kill all 3 guardians before you travel to the hallowed circle.
