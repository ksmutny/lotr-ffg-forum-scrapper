While the changes are usually inconsequential, if you're interested in a letter-perfect separate reference sheet, it does not yet exist.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279143-reference-sheet-with-player-actions/?do=findComment&comment=3403263","commentId":3403263,"userName":"icabod","timestamp":1531424974,"content":"I was working on an aide-memoire - a series of \"phase cards\", which I had included all the steps for each phase, including the player action windows.\n\nThen I saw that someone on the LOTR LCG Players Facebook group has been doing exactly the same thing - a series of printable cards which show the phases of the game, and when you can make player actions.  Freaky coincidence, but he's done a very nice job.  It's in early stages, but I would hope they'll be released (on BGG for example) once complete."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279143-reference-sheet-with-player-actions/?do=findComment&comment=3403483","commentId":3403483,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1531438270,"content":"> 3 hours ago, icabod said:\n> \n> Then﻿ I saw that someone on the LOTR LCG Players Facebo﻿ok group has been doing exactly the same thing - a series of printable cards which show the phases of the game, and when you can make player actions.  Freaky coincidence, but he's done a very nice job﻿.  It's in early stages, but I would hope they'll be released (on BGG for example) once complete.\n\nI think he explicitly cited ryno's player aid as inspiration, which remains to me the best-looking, most functional version of this sort of thing:\n\nhttps://bgg.cc/filepage/116238/lord-rings-lcg-turn-reference-ryno [https://bgg.cc/filepage/116238/lord-rings-lcg-turn-reference-ryno]\n\nI see the appeal of a playing-card-size set of aids, but in the end I think the larger size just makes more sense."}]}
