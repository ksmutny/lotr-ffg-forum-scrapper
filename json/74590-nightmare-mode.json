I didn say Nightmare mode is easy. Buy is more easy solo then coop in my opinion.\n\nAnyway all of this depend on your deck. If you have a good deck, your chance to win increase a lot. So is very, very important to choose right heroes ans make a good synergy deck for them. This is 75% of success. Then you need luck and player skill. But deck building and player skill is one. You cannot separate this 2 things!\n\nWhen i play solo i try to create a powerful deck which one can defeat any quest. then if  you wont play with your friend who also have a strong deck , you just change your decks a bit to have a good synergy between them. So of you have a good 2 decks to play and wins against BOTLT and MAO all other quests looks boring and easy. Difficult 4 or 5??? This is a joke and dont even deserve attention.\n\nFor example: My Thorin Company deck can play 3-4 allies per turn +other support cards and can draw also 3-4 cards per turn. Encounter deck play 1 or if surge 2 cards. Maybe 3 with a good luck with surge but this happen very rare. So after 3 turns i dont really care what encounter deck is playing! Who care! Encounter play 1 cards maybe not even enemy but i play 3-4 allies. So balance is broken cose i quickly overwhelm encounter deck.Ok in Nightmare mode i should play more careful cose i need t play 3 quests in 1 go. So this is still challenge. But honest to say Thorin Company deck is to powerful and there is something wrong with the rules and balance in this game.  Need to fix it. I still believe unlimited draw and hand size bring only problem. As i remember all card games( which ones i use to play) which start with  unlimited draw and hand size always soon or later get the new rules which is limited that.Very good example previpus Lord of the ring TCG from Decipher.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74590-nightmare-mode/?do=findComment&comment=726484","commentId":726484,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1353511939,"content":"Emrad said:\n\nAt some point, my friends and I played the Nightmare mode, and one day, one of them got that now mythic line:\n\n\"Guys, you actually reboot the game as if you were starting one from scratch\".\n\nAnd yes we did actually do that.

This rule have some changes in FAQ.

Of course of you build up the deck and just put the cards without thinking about how they work together….. yes you will get this kind of results what  you have. And of course you will lose most of the time. On this game deck building is really important. So you must ot play attention to your deck building more.\n\nAlso i think i want to try one more house rules to make a single game more hard. In the end of combat when you discard a shadow cards you discard cards withou shadow effect but all cards with shadow effect, victory points ans objective cards you shuffle back into encounter deck. So you till need deal witn them again. I think this rule make encounter deck more powerful on the later phases of game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74590-nightmare-mode/?do=findComment&comment=726692","commentId":726692,"userName":"OnkelZorni","timestamp":1353570120,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nAlso i think i want to try one more house rules to make a single game more hard.
