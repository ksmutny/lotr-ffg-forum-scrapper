A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players. In either case, the character must exhaust and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack.\"\n\n \n\nIn case of Mirkwood Flock and Black Forest Bats:\n\n1)  if they are engaged with other player:\n\nI cannot use a Sentinel character to defend it? \n\nOr that character must have the ranged keyword also, either by print text (Haldir of Lorien or Dunedain Wanderer) or by an attachment (both Dunedain Signal and Cache; a ranged character with the response form Arwen; A Rivendell Bow or an Dunedain Cache on a sentinel character)?\n\n \n\n \n\n2) if they are engaged with me\n\n I must use a ranged character or an eagle to defend it?\n\n \n\nThanks for your replies\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74431-characters-with-ranged-can-attack-or-defend-against/?do=findComment&comment=724775","commentId":724775,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1353142748,"content":"i think the character must either be an eagle or ranged to do either, whether that be through sentinel or directly engaged with you\n\nso if you want to use sentinel then the sentinel character must also have ranged or be an eagle\n\nif the engaged player want to defend then it must also have ranged or be an eagle\n\nthats how i see it\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74431-characters-with-ranged-can-attack-or-defend-against/?do=findComment&comment=724785","commentId":724785,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1353145784,"content":"That is also what i thought, but wanted to ear the opinions of others.\n\n \n\nThat is a little crap… Exhaust a ranged character (which are mostly suited to attack, except perhaps Brand, Dunedain Wanderer and Haldir) to defend a 1/2 attack enemy…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74431-characters-with-ranged-can-attack-or-defend-against/?do=findComment&comment=808294","commentId":808294,"userName":"cyberlettuce","timestamp":1372957110,"content":"I have a question related to this. The Moria bats in Foundations of Stone require that a character has the ranged keyword in order to attack or defend them.
