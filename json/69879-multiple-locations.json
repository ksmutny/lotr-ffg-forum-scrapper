I would expect you'd have to place each \"batch\" of tokens on one or the other (i.e., if you generate two progress, you pick one active location and place both tokens on that card instead of placing one progress on two separate locations). Once you fully explore one, additional tokens should carry over to the other active location.\n\nThat's all really conjecture, though. There's no extant rules text governing multiple active locations, so I'm just guessing here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69879-multiple-locations/?do=findComment&comment=682250","commentId":682250,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1345960374,"content":"sounds about right, ill guess ill play it that way until its Pod then more people will have it so i guess it will get clarified at some point\n\nthanks\n\nrich"}]}
