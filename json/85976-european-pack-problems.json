The Amon Din AP I could buy the same day or the day after release date. I have observed that my local shop normally gets a small batch (maybe 3-5 packs it seems) and then later gets more. If you are too slow and do not buy one from the first shipment then you may have to wait a bit longer. Luckily, in those situations, I have another shop close by that also gets the APs pretty quick so I have never had to wait much.\n\n \n\nMaybe it is a matter of how often your game dealer gets deliveries from FFG. If it is just once per month you could often end up with 3 weeks of waiting, I guess.\n\nEdited July 8, 2013 by IdaL"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=809855","commentId":809855,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1373249315,"content":"this could be it... are you per-ordering the packs?

And I just now found out that one of the 2 stores has the Forest as a NEW package where it doesn't mention Amon Din at all. The other store which mainly distribute via homepage but have a small room to store all the goods in have it for sale already. AND you can see an overview of all planned expansions and AP's.

The german publisher is Heidelberger Spieleverlag. At the moment we are lacking the last three of the Against the Shadow Cycle and the Hobbit on the Doorstep extension. The Black Rider extension is announced for second half this year, which probably means aroung christmas...\n\n//EDIT: For the last three Shadow Cycle packs the publisher announced to release one pack every month from now on...\n\nWe had both POD Sets really fast though, no nightmare sets are announced yet.\n\nBecause of some imprecise translation issues i thought of changing to the english version, but if you started in one language you normally don't want to mix up your cards later. We'll see if i have to change anyway if the game continues to loose players.\n\nEdited July 23, 2013 by Nyck"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=820267","commentId":820267,"userName":"peacott","timestamp":1374615374,"content":"Hi, I am also based in the UK, got tired of waiting and ordered from Miniature Market on 16/07,  it Arrived today.\n\n \n\nI just paid for the basic postage option and for 2 packs cost just over £24 which isn't too bad, just a little more than I usually pay if they arrive in the UK.\n\n \n\nWorth a thought if you are getting desperate for new shiny's like I was.\n\n \n\nPaul\n\nEdited July 23, 2013 by peacott"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85976-european-pack-problems/?do=findComment&comment=820283","commentId":820283,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1374616450,"content":"For those with a low limit for imports: If you happen to have a miniature addiction, I found that combining cards and miniatures can save loads from MM :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nThe only drawback is that we're talking whole collections here, so get together with friends and share the costs.
