The opportunity to play cards then proceeds clockwise around the table.\" [emphasis mine]\n\nSo, once the next player starts to play his cards, you as the previous player have essentially said, \"I will not play any other allies/attachments this planning phase.\" If another player subsequently recurs one of your attachments via the Hammersmith, you'll have to wait until the next turn to play that card."}]}
