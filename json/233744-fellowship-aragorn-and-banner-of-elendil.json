In FOTW if triggers Aragorn's ability, and the bonuses you get make a huge difference. Especially with decks that would otherwise not use Aragorn's resource (except maybe to pay for Gandalf), but even in a Gandalf deck I was playing with lots of neutral cards he can pay for, it's still very much worth it to include that single Banner of Elendil. What do you think?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233744-fellowship-aragorn-and-banner-of-elendil/?do=findComment&comment=2482688","commentId":2482688,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1477948964,"content":"It's a crazy good card is what I think."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233744-fellowship-aragorn-and-banner-of-elendil/?do=findComment&comment=2483022","commentId":2483022,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1477971021,"content":"Yeah it's auto include in the FOTW quests for me.
