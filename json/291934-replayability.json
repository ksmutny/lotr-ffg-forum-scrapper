In your opinion, other than saga expansion quests which are the top 2 or 3 quests that have the most replay value? I realize that this could be somewhat subjective based on what type of quest you like and on your deck choice but I mean based strictly on the story and quest cards. It can be print on demand or regular. Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291934-replayability/?do=findComment&comment=3643499","commentId":3643499,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1552102890,"content":"Murder at the Prancing Pony"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291934-replayability/?do=findComment&comment=3643563","commentId":3643563,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1552112104,"content":"So here's the thing. I replay quests mostly to test new decks, heh. So the quests with the really maximal value are the ones that give me consistent experiences, or to say it differently, I have a pretty good idea what the encounter deck is going to give me. Since you are perhaps thinking of quests to buy, I will name a few non-saga quests not in the core set: Treachery of Rhudaur, Escape from Umbar (other people use this one to test decks I hear, I have not so much), Hunt for Gollum, Watcher in the Water, occasionally Dunland Trap, Intruders in Chetwood, Across the Ettenmoors.\n\nNow, which scenarios do I come back to because I enjoy the scenario and play it for the flavor and fun?  The Battle of Five Armies, Redhorn Gate, Foundations of Stone, Flies and Spiders (wildly unpopular I think, I am alone in this one), The Steward's Fear, Fog on the Barrow-downs (probably my #1 favorite), The Three Trials, Voyage Across Belegaer, Temple of the Deceived.  And I have been using Woodland Realm recently, that's a newer one.  I think Fire in the Night will make it onto that list also, that's a new quest and very good."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291934-replayability/?do=findComment&comment=3643573","commentId":3643573,"userName":"TheSpitfired","timestamp":1552113406,"content":"This will sound so silly - I’ve had the full Mirkwood and dwarrowdwelf cycles for so long but the one quest I keep going back to is Passage Through Mirkwood. When I haven’t played in a long time, when I need a refresher, when I want to play a new deck I go back to the very first quest.\n\nYes it’s fairly simple but it has some dirty twists that it can throw your way. Most of the other quests I’ve played a few times here and there as I get bold, and I only worked through Mirkwood last year and decided to start on khazad-dum in the summer. Otherwise why did I even buy them?\n\nI really liked Hunt for Gollum when I played that one. Maybe I should play it more often. The dream for me - which I know is unrealistic - is to build thematic decks and run them through every quest I own. Some of the quests simply don’t work that way but it’s fun to try.\n\nHope that helps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291934-replayability/?do=findComment&comment=3643771","commentId":3643771,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1552144854,"content":"> 9 hours ago, GrandSpleen said:\n> \n> Flies and Spiders (wildly unpopular I think, I am alone in this one)\n\nI've got your back!

As for others in no particular order I like Across the Ettenmoors, Massing at Osgiliath, Foundations of Stone, Nightmare Journey Along the Anduin, Battle of Lake-Town (hey its Smaug), Peril in Pelargir (excuse to play Beorn), Trouble in Tharbad, anything that feels like Dungeons and Dragons (Rhudaur), and anything with giant Spiders. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291934-replayability/?do=findComment&comment=3644154","commentId":3644154,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1552193829,"content":"I love Treachery in Rhudaur, Encounter at Amon Din, Breaking of the Fellowship, and Nightmare Into Ithilien.

And the best quests I have played are all Saga Quests (5 armies, Pelenor, Helms Deep, Breaking of the Fellowship). \n\nBut so far for replayability I think for me it comes down to quests that turn your best laid plans on their head, challenge the traditional \"stall and build up\" tactic and that have varied experience with each play through, oh and final point is not being insanely unfairly hard *cough carn dum cough* That being said the Angmar cycle is very strong for its use of side quests and how they change up the game and make each quest quite different. I would recommend grabbing that core and picking up Treachery of Rhudar (times mechanic so you have to play fast and clear side quests to get clues and grow in power for the boss fight), Across the Ettenmoors (different random starting side quest and epic massive enemies), or Escape from Mount Gram (remember that deck you built to work around the heroes you perfectly selected, yeah no that's gone, good luck!).\n\n \n\nMassing at Osgiliath is also a lot of fun for a one off that doesn't require a deluxe box as it's a great combat-heavy quest with cool location crossing.\n\nThose are my thoughts so far but my wife and I are only getting started on our journey."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291934-replayability/?do=findComment&comment=3649162","commentId":3649162,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1552726529,"content":"My favourite quests to replay are Nightmare Journey along the Anduin, and Stone of Erech.
