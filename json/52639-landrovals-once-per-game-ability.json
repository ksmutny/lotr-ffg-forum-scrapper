So if he uses it then dies or goes back to my hand for some reason, I don't have another use if I bring another copy in play.  However, I don't know that the rules address it.\n\nThoughts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52639-landrovals-once-per-game-ability/?do=findComment&comment=523822","commentId":523822,"userName":"DarthJalapeno","timestamp":1315099045,"content":"I would guess that it's the ability that is limited to once per game, not once per game per card.\n\nBut this is only my interpretation."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52639-landrovals-once-per-game-ability/?do=findComment&comment=523824","commentId":523824,"userName":"BranWheatKillah","timestamp":1315099334,"content":"I agree.
