I find her willpower too good to pass up and she frees up other heroes to do something else. I like Legolas a great deal, as well. His ability coupled with a Blade of Gondolin is great to continue to advance scenarios, even if you are struggling to quest. I was a bit disappointed that he doesn't seem to be that useful in the Hunt for Gollum due to the lack of enemies. Though for what I've heard about Carrock, tactics may be a must. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52186-solo-deck-4-color-control/?do=findComment&comment=520469","commentId":520469,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1314377225,"content":"BeeGentle said:\n\nI just can't seem to find a good use for Legolas.

In my deck with Legolas, Eowyn and Beravor was actually a big reason why it did so well. Eowyn quests, Legolas attacks, and Beravor can help out with either of those two, defend, or draw cards. Clearly both Legolas and Eowyn have weaknesses, that's why you need other heroes and allies to offset those.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52186-solo-deck-4-color-control/?do=findComment&comment=521921","commentId":521921,"userName":"BeeGentle","timestamp":1314693533,"content":"OK, I've fined tuned this thing and I've been absolutely demolishing everything other than Escape From Gul'Dor with this deck:\n\nHeroes:\n\nBervaor(10)\n\nEowyn(9)\n\nThalin(9)\n\nAllies(16):\n\n3x Gandalf(centered around him and his entry abilities)\n\n1x Henamarth Riversong(very underrated!)\n\n2x Erebor Hammersmith(attachment returns, mostly for Born Alofts)\n\n1x Miner of the Iron Hills(kind of a plug card...he's cheap and can occasionally be meaningful though)\n\n3x Rivendell Minstrel(feeder for SoK)\n\n2x Winged Guardian(good cheap blocker)\n\n3x Veteran Axehand(cheap blocker but also 2 dmg for only 2 G)\n\n1x Eomund(solid ally for 3 G)\n\nAttachments(15):\n\n2x Protector of Lorien(amazing quest pusher or shield wall w/ Beravor)\n\n3x Song of Kings(obv)\n\n2x Steward of Gondor(incredibly strong...3G a turn for Eowyn or Beravor)\n\n1x Celebrian's Stone(goes well on Eowyn to rake 6 or 7 WP a turn)\n\n1x Horn of Gondor(also strong if you can get it with all of the Gandalf rubberbanding)\n\n1x Unexpected Courage(Beravor loves this)\n\n3x Born Aloft(best card in the game atm, imo)\n\n2x Forest Snare(Nice for unexpected bigs that you'd rather not have attack...looking at you Hill Troll and Muck Adder)\n\nEvents(16):\n\n2x Feint(1G says you can't attack me, sweet!)\n\n2x Lorien's Wealth(goes well with Protector of Lorien or if you badly need to find a power card)\n\n2x Thicket of Spears(emergency card)\n\n1x Swift Strike(doesn't get much use but combined with Thalin's passive this can be enough to insta-kill some enemies)\n\n1x Stand Together(another emergency card)\n\n2x A Test of Will(treachery shutdown)\n\n1x Fortune or Fate(sometimes people die...not often though)\n\n1x Blade Mastery(good for finishing off a pestering enemy)\n\n2x Sneak Attack(Hi, I'm Gandalf, here's 4 damage, cya)\n\n2x The Galadhrian's Greeting(tremendous threat management card)\n\n \n\nI think the biggest going for this deck is all the Gandalf manipulation and its versatility. You can use Gandalf to manage threat or damage big enemies(or Goblin Snipers), then combo with Born Aloft and Hammersmiths. He can even come in just to block or attack during combat phases then snap back into your hand.\n\nThe first few rounds need to be about getting a Song of Kings for Eowyn or Beravor and then hopefully a UC or SoG to keep things rolling. From there you get more resources then you'll need to keep spamming Gandalf every round. Also, you can draw a ton of cards and use Protector of Lorien to rush through a quest or location pretty easily.\n\nI'm going to research the Nightmare rules carefully and then give this deck some runs at it when I get some more time.\n\nAnywho, I thought I would post it for other solo players and see if you guys have any thoughts on possible improvements."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52186-solo-deck-4-color-control/?do=findComment&comment=521934","commentId":521934,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1314695524,"content":" When you call Thicket of Spears an emergency card, I'm guessing your talking about playing it.  I just wanted to point out that in this deck Thicket of Spears is only useful as a card to discard due to the fact that you have to pay for it from three different heroes' resource pools.  I think you'd be better off with two copies of Will of the West so you can reshuffle your discard pile back into your deck.  You will especially want it if you're playing the Nightmare variant.\n\nAll in all this deck looks really good.  I think I'll try it out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52186-solo-deck-4-color-control/?do=findComment&comment=521956","commentId":521956,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1314699516,"content":"Very similar to a deck I built, only it used Legolas instead of Thalin.

A card like Winged Guardian actually specifies a Tactics resource, so unless I'm doing it wrong, I think that's how it works and every now and then that card proves to be incredibly useful if I can't get a Feint or Sneak Attack to stop one of my heroes from getting crunched.\n\nWill of the West will probably have to go in for a Nightmare run, which will just spin-cycle the whole Gandalf spam all over again.

Well, it's not a very important card for this deck anyway. So, just substitute Will of the West or Stand and Fight! for those.\n\nI would say sub another Tactics event card for Thicket of Spears but Tactics events are generally pretty weak with the exception of Feint and Stand Together. If there were a Song of Whatever that gave you a Tactics resource I would probably swap Thalin for Theodred and use Tactics as the odd-man out instead of the way I currently I have it set up. Leadership has better all-around cards than Tactics, though Born Aloft is so strong in conjuction with Gandalf and Steward of Gondor that it's a must have. FFG really should have made Born Aloft unique or cost 1G, it's just too strong against the current quests.\n\nCombined with the Hammersmith and Sneak Attack you can easily have Gandalf every round and never put him in the discard pile. preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]"}]}
