Then, Chief Turch’s passive effect would immediately cause him to engage the first player again, removing another time counter for a total of 2 time counters removed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111740-three-trials-guardians/?do=findComment&comment=1174070","commentId":1174070,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1406586512,"content":"Yeah, thanks for the answer.

In a multi player game would this mean the guardian remains engaged with that player? Or does the guardian then engage the new first player at the start of the next round? I just want to make sure I don't need to add the guardian back to the staging area or switch endgame ya with different players.

My question came about because I am using Sam and I was not sure if I was able to trigger his response but it makes sense now because the guardian would move to the \"new\" first player during engagement phase...just to be clear, we have to exhaust a hero to claim a key right? I noticed the keys don't have the guarded keyword on them but some do attach to a location or guardian through the quest text. At that point we have to damage the hero or explore the location to have the opportunity to claim it?\n\nThanks for your help, sorry for all the questions :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited August 17, 2014 by oldoly"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111740-three-trials-guardians/?do=findComment&comment=1207710","commentId":1207710,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1408301564,"content":"I don't remember seing anything to claim the keys, when they are unatached, they are automatically claimed and attached to one of your hero if I remember correctly."}]}
