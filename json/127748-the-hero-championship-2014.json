I really wanted to wait for the last hero to be revealed, but it looks like they showed up late to the party.\n\n \n\nSeeding is based on last year's results with the new heroes being semi-arbitrarily added throughout the list. \n\n \n\nVote for your favorite hero as they enter their match-ups in the responses below. Vote on whatever criteria you desire. Feel free to campaign for you hero, criticize the seeding and give your vote rationale.

I went with Caldara though because she brought a whole new way to play the game that actually works and is pretty strong. Boromir is great, but every deck i play him in relies on Aragorn lore to save his a@@, so she get's my vote.\n\nIdreaan vs pippin Lo. I like both these heroes, i went with Idrean because i built my firs ally free deck with her and had a blast. She brings something to spirit sphere that was lacking. Pippin is probably the more versatile hero, but I really only play him in hobbit deck. His 6 threat is great, but the 2 hp always make me nervous.\n\nDunehere vs. merry. Same story as above. I only really use merry in hobbit deck. Dunhere on the other hand is always fun to play in the right deck. Funny enough he is often paired with merry for merry's low threat and ability to play the spears, but dunhere is the star of those types of decks, merry is there for utilitarian purposes. Although merry is a beast in hobbit deck and loved playing him during Black Riders.\n\nSome tough choices. Looking forward to seeing how this goes.\n\nThanks for putting it together agian."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1345328","commentId":1345328,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1416863421,"content":"Yay, thanks for doing this!\n\n \n\nA- Theoden\n\nB- Bard\n\nC- Eowyn\n\nD- Elrohir\n\nE- Frodo\n\nF- Ori\n\nG- Boromir\n\nH- Balin\n\nI- Imrahil\n\nJ-Denethor\n\nK-Bifur\n\nL-Idraen\n\nM-Merry\n\nN-Gandalf\n\nO-Haldir\n\nP-Galadriel\n\nQ-Beorn\n\nR-Mablung\n\nS-Celeborn\n\nT-Gimli\n\nU-Grima\n\nV-Dain\n\nW-Eomer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1345368","commentId":1345368,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1416865585,"content":"Yeah, this was a lot of fun last time around. Thanks for bringing it back!\n\n \n\nA: Nori - I want to pick Theoden for theme reasons, but Nori is so good in a Dwarf deck. Potentially one of the best threat reducers around.\n\nB: Brand - Bard has epic art and is useful. Brand can be stupidly powerful with the right combinations.\n\nC: Eowyn - No contest here.\n\nD: Elrohir - This is a really tough one. Thorin is great and very powerful for Dwarves. Elrohir can be game changing though.\n\nE: Frodo - Hirluin and Outlands is obviously very powerful, but Frodo is an amazing defensive solution for all kinds of scenarios.\n\nF: Ori - Thalin was key for me back in the day, but that Dwarven card draw is strong.\n\nG: Tactics Boromir - Caldara is good but Boromir is great.\n\nH: Balin - Eleanor can definitely come in handy, but I find Balin to be an overall better package.\n\nI: Imrahil - I'm not as down on Lore Glorfindel as many are, but Imrahil is better all around due to the readying.\n\nJ: Denethor - Big D is simply more useful more of the time.\n\nK: Bifur - Low threat and key resource smoothing wins the day. Gloin is really fun though.\n\nL - Lore Pippin - Idraen is a really good hero, but I've used Pippin a lot more and he can fit into a bunch of decks.\n\nM - Merry - Again, Dunhere is good, but I'm partial to the Hobbits.\n\nN - Gandalf - Sorry, Bombur, but Gandalf wins the day.\n\nO - Beravor - I probably would've picked Haldir until recently, when I've rediscovered the utility of Beravor.\n\nP - Galadriel - That [Leadership hero] is good for nothing and still owes me 20 bucks!\n\nQ - Beorn - Elladan is definitely solid, and I love a twins deck, but Beorn is a force when used correctly.\n\nR - Mablung - More useful as an actual participant in questing or combat.\n\nS - Celeborn - Great hero that really put Silvan on a solid footing from the beginning of the cycle.\n\nT - Gimli - I like Bilbo, but the whole idea of becoming stronger with damage still intrigues me.\n\nU - Grima - Grima's so different than the other heroes in terms of theme and ability.\n\nV - Dain - Spirit Pippin is crushed under the (iron)foot of the mighty Dain.\n\nW - Eomer - Although I do use Mirlonde quite a bit, Eomer is just a killing machine and fun to use."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1345416","commentId":1345416,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1416867255,"content":"A - Nori. I'm one of those guys who wants another version of him, a better one!\n\nB - Brand son of Bain. His ability I find far more usefull!\n\nC - Eowyn. Of course she's better, but I do like Dwalin. But forced to choose, no doubt.\n\nD - Elrohir. Elrohir can fit in more kinds of decks, Thorin is only Dwarfdeck playable. And Elrohirs ability is great!\n\nE - Frodo. Come on, everybody hates Outlands.  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nF - Thalin. His ability is still quite good. In the newer cycle his power fades a bit, but Ori is as with Thorin, only Dwarfdeck.\n\nG - Tactics Boromir. Caldara needs a special deck. Boromir just some threatred, money and go for it.\n\nH - Balin. Shadow effects keep getting nastier and nastier.\n\nI - Imrahil. Overall better playable. Really though choice. He just to be my favorite hero back in the day!\n\nJ - Denethor. Not a real choice. Fatty's just Fatty and Denethor can do something more and his ability is more usefull.\n\nK - Bifur. Like his ability just a little bit more, but I use them together most of the time. Too bad they are pitched together. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nL - Lore Pippin. Idraen is great, but really specific for locationcontrol decks. Pippin is a splasher more and like his low threat!\n\nM - Merry. More versatile then Dunhere. Dunhere needs a special designed deck and Merry is secrecy and splashtactics.\n\nN - Gandalf. Fat Dwarves are not really usefull... Not a real choice/contest here.\n\nO - Haldir. Great ability! Wingfoot works great with Beravor, but still find Haldir more powerfull overall and less work to work.\n\nP - Galadriel. Easy win!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nQ - Beorn. Elladan is the lesser of the twins IMO. Beorn is a powerfull creature (!) on his own.\n\nR - Mablung. He makes resource collection a lot more fun and has better stats, Theodred is only there for the money.\n\nS - Celeborn. \"Or rather Dain as he should be.\" Oin has a cool ability but Celeborn put Silvan in the picture.\n\nT - Gimli. Gimli has been one of our great saviors since the Core Set and Bilbo has a too high threshold.\n\nU - Grima. Like the idea of alternate history. His ability is not really my cup of tea but he's just cool!\n\nV - Dain. Dain, the might lord of the Dwarves. Man, he's strong! Like him a lot, although he maybe should be nerfed.\n\nW - Eomer. Mirlonde is great for mono Lore, but apart from that Eomer is just great all times! Rohan Warlord!\n\n \n\nSome choices were hard and others were really easy.

Maybe someday you'll get the pity vote.\n\nC - Dwalin - Killing orcs + reducing threat for the win!\n\nD - Elrohir - The twins are amazing. Thorin has threat that I'm not willing to go for very often.\n\nE - Hirluin the Fair - Frodo is already a main character. Let Hirluin get some attention.\n\nF - Ori - Two cards is too good to pass up. Thalin's ability is a little situational.\n\nG - Boromir - Generally, I like to keep my heroes alive instead of sacrificing them for worse allies. \n\nH - Eleanor - Cancellation is much more appreciated and rare than resource generation. \n\nI - Imrahil - This is my pick for the overall champion! Imrahil is one of my absolute favorites. Lorfindel doesn't stand a chance.\n\nJ - Denethor - Hobbits will not take the win again. I'm rooting for Gondor!\n\nK - Gloin - Awesome axe art. \n\nL - Idraen - If Gondor doesn't make it, then it's Dunedain for me!

But I think brute force is better than an obligatory Elrohir in order to make it work.\n\nR - Mablung - Gotta vote for those awesome Gondor rangers.\n\nS - Oin - Again, Celeborn is better. But I have always liked Oin, from the first moment I saw the card. Don't know why.\n\nT- Gimli - Hands down. Rooting for my favorite damage soaker.\n\nU - Grima - Don't like either of them, but Grima's a little more interesting.\n\nV- Dain - I don't think I've ever used Spirit Pippin... at all. Sad, but not surprising.\n\nW - Eomer - Another hard choice. Mirlonde is amazing, but I like Eomer's fighting prowess more than threat reduction."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1345668","commentId":1345668,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1416884924,"content":"A - Nori\n\nB - Bard \n\nC - Eowyn \n\nD - Thorin\n\nE - Frodo\n\nF - Ori\n\nG - Boromir (T)\n\nH - Balin\n\nI - Imrahil\n\nJ - Denethor\n\nK - Bifur\n\nL - Pippin (Lo)\n\nM - Merry\n\nN - Gandalf\n\nO - Haldir\n\nP - Leadership Hero\n\nQ - Beorn\n\nR - Theodred\n\nS - Celeborn\n\nT - Gimli\n\nU - Grima\n\nV - Dain\n\nW - Eòmer\n\nEdited November 25, 2014 by Chris51261"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1345680","commentId":1345680,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1416886002,"content":"> P - Leadership Hero\n\nI think an upset is brewing!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1345736","commentId":1345736,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1416889919,"content":"A: Nori\n\nB: Brand\n\nC: Éowyn\n\nD: Elrohir\n\nE: Frodo\n\nF: Thalin\n\nG: Tactics Boromir\n\nH: Balin\n\nI: Imrahil\n\nJ: Denethor\n\nK: Bifur\n\nL - Lore Pippin\n\nM - Dúnhere\n\nN - Bombur\n\nO - Haldir\n\nP - Galadriel (Though I was tempted to pick the alternative)\n\nQ - Beorn\n\nR - Mablung\n\nS - Celeborn\n\nT - Gimli\n\nU - Háma\n\nV - Dain\n\nW - Éomer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1345781","commentId":1345781,"userName":"pixcalcis","timestamp":1416893051,"content":"A-Nori\nB- Bard\nC-Eowyn\nD-Elrohir\nE-Frodo\nF-Thalin- love his ability and love direct damage decks.\nG-Boromir- I dont use him much, but he is a champ.

Theoden. I like balanced heroes who can serve several purposes, and the defunct king of Rohan is a good quester, and even if not amazingly, he can combat decently too. Nori is a good hero too, but not so versatile and depends too much on dwarf synergy to be awesome. And Théoden gets the Villeneuve point ^^.\n\n \n\nB. Brand. Apparently I am one of the very few who likes these two heroes since I don't like playing solo (it's not Brand's fault to have that face). It was a tough call, even more against Villeneuve point but once again, with his special ability Brand proves to be more versatile (even with that huh? face of his). Not like it matters since Éowyn will obliterate him in the next round but, GO BRAND! \n\n \n\nC. Éowyn. Dwalin, you never were a particularly good hero (even if yours is one of the dwarf designs I like better), and your ally version is much more useful... you never stood a chance.\n\n \n\nD. Thorin. I like the twins, but the fact that you need both for them to be good still hurts. Thorin is a nice quester, and has decent attack power and he is a dwarf (even if I don't like dwarves I have to acknowledge their power). Once again, sorry, Villeneuve point (even more against the holy bearded mother)\n\n \n\nE. Frodo. I actually like Hirluin, since he's one of the very few ranged heroes out of tactics and I love his name in Spanish - Hirluin el Hermoso, but Frodo's ability to sponge damage has saved me lots of times.\n\n \n\nF. Thalin. Ori needs more preparation to be really good and with the increase of damage to staging area cards I think Thalin became a more solid choice (particularly combined with Haldir and the ranger bows) and in combat is more or less okay.\n\n \n\nG. Boromir (T). I like Caldara, a lot. But the problem is that even if she has an interesting ability and the Villeneuve point... she is pretty weak as a hero per se. Not a great quester and a pitiful fighter. And I like the alternative art of Boromir.\n\n \n\nH. Eleanor. I think both are amazingly good, providing permanent cancel ability but, truth to be told, end-breaking cards are usually treachery cards. I can't recall how many times has she already saved my group's ass. Maybe with peril rules and the late development of cannot be cancelled cards she might be becoming weaker but still pretty solid. And last nail to Balin's coffin, Villeneuve point.\n\n \n\nI. Glorfindel. Yes, I know, I deserve dead for not choosing Imrahil but I think lore Glorfindel is actually a pretty underrated hero (he's only real downside is the existence of spirit Godfidel). He is a good quester, good attacker and, paired with Elrond, healing when you really need it, from the very beginning. Pity the art is kind of meh. It was a hard choice, though.\n\n \n\nJ. Fatty. I don't think in multiplayer Denethor is such a good hero even if he can be a decent defender. I like the hobbit since it's a good way to make use of a really low threat (it's not really that useful to 20 less than the rest of the party) and sometimes can be really helpful. Not great but not bad.\n\n \n\nK. Bifur. Low threat, and good ability; very good to stabilize multisphere decks.\n\n \n\nL. Idraen. The macho-girl versatility is what makes her so good. With well-rounded attributes and auto-ready ability I think she is pretty good. I think Peregrin is a good hero but that fragility of his makes me a little bit nervous in certain scenarios.\n\n \n\nM. Merry. Dunhere is good hero but when it comes to versatility, Merry is better, as a quester and even as a fighter (particularly for his readying ability). Low threat is also a good think. The only thing that almost made me choose Dunhere is the same reason why I discarded Pippin, those 2 hp...\n\n \n\nN. Gandalf. Hands down, a beast of a hero. Both amazing and well-rounded attributes and a great ability (also comes with a lot of accessories, like a Barbie). I don't like him that much because I think the ally is very helpful and versatile but the fact that he is a beast cannot be denied. Poor Bombur, bat match-up.\n\n \n\nO. Beravor. Only because of her (his?) versatility. Not amazing at anything but can quest, fight or provide cards. Tough call, though, since I think Haldir is a powerhouse but I always prefer versatility if I can choose. And I don't like heroes with an ally version.\n\n \n\nP. Galadriel. I think she will be a dark horse of this tournament. The more I use her the more I think she is awesome. With easy-to-flee allies such as Gandalf, Elrond, Refugees, Saruman, she multiplies their usefulness allowing them to use their awesome questing power and then fight or chumpblock. Also free threat lowering and drawing effect? Yes, please.\n\n \n\nQ. Beorn. I like bears and in this case, Beorn is a \"beast\" fighting with base 5 atk power and non-exhausting defense. Once again, I like the twins but their mutual dependence makes them a harder pick.\n\n \n\nR. Mablung. Probably one of the tightest fights. Resource acceleration is always a good thing. However, tactics really needed resource acceleration while in leadership are several other options. And Mablung is a more well-rounded character. \n\n \n\nS. Celeborn. Stronger hero, stronger ability, Magali Villeneuve. \n\n \n\nT. Gimli. Awesome versatility and the dwarf trait. It could have been a harder fight if Bilbo had a realistic initial threat like 6 or 7 (I don't think his ability deserves making his threat so high with such crappy attributes).\n\n \n\nU. Háma. I like them both but the recycling ability of Háma can be really good and Wormtongue is not really that popular in multiplayer since he can crash your party strategy.\n\n \n\nV. Dain. I think Spirit Pippin is not that bad, but Lore one is much better and Dain is the cornerstone of the over 9000 dwarves.\n\n \n\nW. Mirlonde. Once again a tough call. Even if both of them are pretty specific at what they do (Éomer is there to kill and Mirlonde to quest) the fact that Mirlonde is one of the very few choices besides Godfindel to try secrecy makes her a little bit better and being a Silvan can sponge a little bit of damage. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1347234","commentId":1347234,"userName":"chrsjxn","timestamp":1416991842,"content":"A-Theoden\nB-Bard\nC-Eowyn\nD-Thorin\nE-Frodo\nF-Thalin\nG-Caldara\nH-Eleanor\nI-Imrahil\nJ-Denethor\nK-Bifur\nL-Pippin\nM-Merry\nN-Gandalf\nO-Beravor\nP-Galadriel\nQ-Beorn\nR-Theodred\nS-Celeborn\nT-Gimli\nU-Hama\nV-Dain\nW-Eomer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1347313","commentId":1347313,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1417001214,"content":"Guys, if Bilbo's properly used he is one of the best heroes.

I assumed that you actually meant that that was all you needed. In many cases, that will be true, but if you use PoL too much, you'll run out of cards so you'll want some more permanent boosts. If you can get Arwen and the Boots out, then I would consider him much more usable. I still prefer a defender that can do a decent job right out of the gate (3+ defense and hit points base), but if you were able to set up quickly enough, then I wouldn't mind using him. The issue is that Denethor has a lower starting threat and starts off with these base stats so is much more useful. Not to mention he can get a permanent +2 defense with Shield of Gondor. Bilbo has the advantage that a lot of the cards that he can use to become a decent defender reside in his own sphere or are neutral (aside from Arwen), but even Denethor could use Protector of Lorien.\n\nI just don't see the point of gimping yourself with a weak defender to start if you can get a notably stronger one with less threat. The card draw is a strong consideration, but it's not too hard to get the card draw you need from Lore without him. His Hobbit trait is useful in certain decks, but under usual circumstances I'd take someone else instead.\n\n \n\nI don't want to be stomping all over your opinion or anything, but your argument is that Bilbo is a great defender. With your logic, almost any hero can be a good defender if you devote enough deck space to making them so, which is actually true. So really, Bilbo's only real strength is the one everyone already knows about: card draw."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1347757","commentId":1347757,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1417027483,"content":"I vote for Grima."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1347759","commentId":1347759,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1417027536,"content":"Bilbo is a great defender mainly because of his ability to attach Fast Hitch which enables him to defend multiple times.

In the more recent scenarios 3 -5 attack strength is becoming the norm, so I'm not sure how he would hold up nowadays, since he could get hit hard early on and he need s a bit of set up with the cards you mentioned.\n\nLook at Three trials for instance. Bilbo would not stand a chance, where there a re a number of other defenders that can hold there own. I'd say second best defender is pushing it. He's decent, but i think the best defenders now are from gondor and have easy access to Gondorian shield. If not from Gondor then they get SoG to provide the trait."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1347922","commentId":1347922,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1417036054,"content":"> Bilbo is a great defender mainly because of his ability to attach Fast Hitch which enables him to defend multiple times.

Three base defense, 4 hitpoints, the right sphere to receive burning brand and the right trait to receive Cloak of Lorien. And yeah like you said he can boost healing on himself OH and can also receive Elven Mail as well. \n\nBut yeah Bilbo is definitely not the second best defensive hero, potentially not even top five either as Beorn, . \n\nAlso as good as Fast hitch is on Bilbo, Elrohir's response ability is far better as you can block as many attacks as you have resources on him. Hmmmmm actually I guess that because Fast Hitch isn't restricted or even limit one per character you could put 2 or 3 on Bilbo which would be pretty decent allowing him to defend up to four times, his low defense and health still poses a problem however and I would not trust him in Nightmare quests or pretty much any quest where there are enemies with 5 or more attack (most quests lol) as he will almost definitely require constant healing or constant discarding of your hand (to protector of lorien) to boost his defense. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1348261","commentId":1348261,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1417056523,"content":"Yeah burning brand on Elrond with a healer handy is often enough (till boss types show up).

As with all of our card designs for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, we try to combine the spirit of the source material with a fitting game mechanic. Accordingly, the first part of our rational for making Gríma a hero is thematic.\n\n\nGríma was chief advisor to the King of Rohan, which made him a very influential person in Middle-earth. It’s safe to assume he did not attain that position by giving bad advice. Gríma’s wisdom and cunning must have benefitted Rohan initially in order for Théoden to promote him to his lofty position, and in the timeline of the card game Gríma’s treachery, like Saruman’s, was not yet fully developed. It is possible that Gríma could have chosen the hero path at this time.\n\n\nMechanically, Gríma has a unique place in The Voice of Isengard that only he can fill. As the only character in the game with both the Rohan andIsengard traits, Grima bridges the two factions present on the player cards in the box. Furthermore, his ability allows players to take full advantage of the Doomed mechanic: “Action: Lower the cost of the next card you play from your hand this round by 1. That card gains Doomed 1. (Limit once per round.)” As a Lore hero, Gríma belongs to a sphere that excels at drawing cards but struggles to find the resources to pay for them, so he will be a welcome addition to many decks. Having trouble finding matching resources to pay for cards in your dual-sphere deck? Make it easier to play them by lowering their cost! Want to play a four cost ally on your first turn? Now you can! These are just a couple of the ways you can benefit from heeding Gríma’s counsel.\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1349390","commentId":1349390,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1417179839,"content":"By the way, reading this article now it's funny how there is emphasis on Grima \"bridging two factions together - Rohan and Isengard\", when cycle has ZERO Isengard support at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1349431","commentId":1349431,"userName":"Girugatrap","timestamp":1417183229,"content":"A- Nori\n\nB- Bard\n\nC- Eowyn\n\nD- Thorin\n\nE- Hirluin\n\nF- Thalin\n\nG- Boromir (T)\n\nH- Eleanor\n\nI- Prince Imrahil\n\nJ- Denethor\n\nK- Bifur\n\nL- Pipin (Lo)\n\nM- Merry\n\nN- Gandalf\n\nO- Haldir\n\nP- Galadriel\n\nQ- Beorn\n\nR- Mablung\n\nS- Oin\n\nT- Gimli\n\nU- Hama\n\nV- Dain\n\nW- Eomer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1349451","commentId":1349451,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1417184935,"content":"A - Nori\n\nB - Brand \n\nC - Dwalin\n\nD - Thorin\n\nE - Frodo\n\nF - Thalin\n\nG - Caldara\n\nH - Balin\n\nI - Prince Imrahil\n\nJ - Denethor\n\nK - Bifur\n\nL - Idraen\n\nM - Dunhere\n\nN - Gandalf\n\nO - Haldor\n\nP - Galadriel\n\nQ - Beorn\n\nR - Mablung\n\nS - Celeborn\n\nT - Gimli\n\nU - Hama\n\nV - Dain\n\nW- Eomer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1349476","commentId":1349476,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1417186523,"content":"> By the way, reading this article now it's funny how there is emphasis on Grima \"bridging two factions together - Rohan and Isengard\", when cycle has ZERO Isengard support at all.\n\nYep.

He seems like a decent bridge to me. The only downside is the tiny amount of Isengard cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1349987","commentId":1349987,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1417208871,"content":"This way, any doomed card can be called a card that bridges Isengard and all other traits, which is would not be a valid point.\n\nEdited November 28, 2014 by MyNeighbourTrololo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1350037","commentId":1350037,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1417210635,"content":"X - Legolas - No contest\n\nY - Eowyn - A one trick pony, but she's essential for Rohan decks and still the best at questing\n\nZ - Elrohir - The better of the twins, and I've never been able to use Boromi's ability well.  Imrahil is always better.\n\nAA - Frodo - Aragorn can be a beast with the Sword, but Frodo is one of my favorite heroes.  If only you could use him in the saga boxes.\n\nAB - Elrond - I like Thalin, but he doesn't scale to the new quests well.  Elrond is a stud, although I find Vilya decks to be very boring.\n\nAC - Eleanor - I know Boromir can be a beast, but I just don't like that kind of deck and Eleanor's art is 100x better.\n\nAD - Beregond - Toughest pick so far.  I love Imrahil, but there is nothing quite like Beregond.\n\nAE - Denethor - The original defender.  I like his synergy with burning brand and shield.  I also like the potential of heir of Mardil (and optional Palantir for the theme win)\n\nAF - Pippin - I love Sam too and he can be a powerhouse, but Pippin is my go-to lore hero and in almost every secrecy deck I run.\n\nAG - Merry - I love the Hobbits, but this is more a protest vote against Gandalf.\n\nAH - Faramir - I have an irrational love for Faramir and I fully understand that Haldir is better in virtually every way.  I just want to make sure Faramir doesn't get shut out.\n\nAI - Galadriel - Tough call because I like Beorn.  However, I almost never play him and Galadriel is new and shiny and opens up more secrecy options.\n\nAJ - Mablung - Another tough call because I use Glorfindel a lot for secrecy.  I hope Galadriel can reduce my reliance on him and I am really excited about the potential of Mablung/Dunedain deck.\n\nAK - Celeborn - Silvan decks are so much fun and he is the anchor.  I like Gimli, but rarely use him anymore.\n\nAL - Hama - Aragorn is better, but for some reason his threat reset feels like a gimmick to me, especially when you use it on multiple people.  I love the Rohan/mount synergy that is developing. \n\nAM - Eomer - This is an actual vote for Eomer instead of just a protest vote against Dain.  Just needs one attachment to be attacking for 7 with splash.\n\nEdited November 28, 2014 by Teamjimby"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1350107","commentId":1350107,"userName":"iznax","timestamp":1417214382,"content":"X- Nori : While many people like to \"cry\" about Dain and use Legolas to wipe the table and make a tone of progress (no mater battle, siege or normal questing) i'm just a humble dwarf guy ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\nY- Eowyn: a straightforward hero with a cool ability, what's not to love?\n\n \n\nZ- Boromir (L): Gondor \"Dain+\"\n\n \n\nAA- Aragorn (L): I like Frodo a lot but i can't play all quests with him (saga) :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\n \n\nAB- Thalin: 1 Elrond ally is so cool. 2 Elrond hero with, vilya, gandalf, stargazer = bananas and 0 fun. 3 Thalin is a Dwarf :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nAC- Boromir (T): One man army.\n\n \n\nAD- Beregond: Defend ? hahahaha\n\n \n\nAE- Bifur: resource manipulation ? solved!\n\n \n\nAF- Sam: I just flipped a coin for this one, soooo hard :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\n \n\nAG- Mery: If you like this game you are o LOTR fun, so you will love to have your epic Gandalf moment, and you have to be a bad person to deny this from others. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nAH- Haldir: ...\n\n \n\nAI- Beorn: Soooo hard but i love this so unique bear.\n\n \n\nAJ- Glorgindel (s): ...\n\n \n\nAK- Gimli: The old fashioned killer never gets old\n\n \n\nAL- Aragorn (L): Threat prob? nop!\n\n \n\nAM- Dain Ironfoot: King !

Legolas. He's always been pretty good but since now silvans can sponge damage to a certain degree without bothering that much and get attack over 9000, he's sooo much better. And Villeneuve point.\n\n \n\nY. Eowyn. Since both of them are one-trick ponies and designers have decided that being one of the best archers of human history is not good enough to allow you to use an elven bow (cause everybody knows only elves can shoot), Bard became one of the worst choices if you are looking for a ranged hero.\n\n \n\nZ. Boromir. Mass boosting is always a good thing to have (even more in multiplayer) and Villeneuve point. Moreover, Elrohir alone... bad choice.\n\n \n\nAA. Frodo. The peace of mind his damage-swallow ability brings is priceless. I think Leadagorn is good but most likely the worst out of his 3 actual versions.\n\n \n\nAB. Elrond. Really good quester and defender, and being elf and lore allows more cards to boost these aspects. And multisphere smoothing plus healing boost. One of the epitomes of versatility. And Villeneuve point. Can I ask for more?\n\n \n\nAC. Eleanor. Yes, Boromir is a one-man shield (because there are no real good attack boosters for Gondor characters and no way to make him an elf) but that's pretty much it. Eleanor's treachery cancel can save a game and in worst case can be\n\nimprovised as a defender with a shield.. \n\n \n\nAD. Imrahil. Imrahil is pretty versatile and has autoreading ability which is good and being a Gondor allows to boost questing and defense. Beregond is a one-trick pony.\n\n \n\nAE. Bifur. I never thought Denethor deserved to pass last round so why should I vote for him in this one when Bifur is actually a really good hero.\n\n \n\nAF. Sam. When it comes to attributes, Sam wins. He can be autoreadied. No **** 2 hp and free pony. Better quester. And let's be fair, usually Pippin owner end up depending on other players to save their sorry asses in order to draw more ^^.\n\n \n\nAG. Gandalf. One of the best heroes there are (best attributes, awesome ability and lots of good attachments). I don't like using him that much but the fact that he is awesome is undeniable. And I think the sneak+Gandalf combo could take a rest.\n\n \n\nAH. Haldir. A better ranged hero choice, even more being an elf plus the possibility of the preventive strike. And the Faramir ally is so much better.\n\n \n\nAI. Galadriel. I have already said that I think she is the dark horse of the tournament so making her drop here would be contradicting myself ^^. It was a tough call, however.\n\n \n\nAJ. Mablung. Leaving aside my disdain for Godfindel being in almost all decks... I think Mablung is awesome. More resources in tactics + Gondor (blood of gondor and gondorian fire) is always a good thing to have. He can also be boosted by the Visionary Leadership and Théoden as well as get a shield which gives him more versatility in my opinion. \n\n \n\nAK. Celeborn. I think as a hero per se Gimli is better than Celeborn but Celeborn has a mass boosting ability which in the end makes him the best choice. And put him together with a Galadriel...\n\n \n\nAL. Loragorn. I like Háma a lot but he is less versatile than Loragorn and there are very good uses for threat resetting. If have had ranged or an easy way to get I could change my mind but since there is only one card (and it's not even his own sphere).\n\n \n\nAM. Dain. Mass boost always wins. The more the players the more mass boost wins. And Éomer is a one-trick pony. I like him better but truth to be told... Dain IS better.\n\nEdited November 29, 2014 by Albafika"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1350582","commentId":1350582,"userName":"Glowwyrm","timestamp":1417243167,"content":"X- Legolas: I like Nori, but this is an easy win\nY- Eowyn: tough match-up for Bard, but Eowyn is just too good to vote out now\nZ-Elrohir: he's the best defender in the game once he's all set up\nAA- Aragorn: lots of fond memories from the core set days, and he's great in the saga expansions (until we can't use him)\nAB- Elrond: don't really have anything to say.  He's great\nAC- Boromir (Tactics): one of my favorite heroes, there's just so many epic moments you can pull off with him\nAD: Imrahil: getting new life with his buddy Eomer\nAE: Denethor: tough call because both are good, so I'm going with my favorite chracter\nAF: Sam: hard choice because I usually use them in tandem and both are valuable even when separated, but Sam is my favorite character from the books\nAG: Gandalf: he's awesome and opens up a lot of fun new decks to play.  I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of his potential, and the really high threat decks I'm making with him are a blast to play\nAH: Haldir: what Faramir should have been\nAI: Galadriel: do you want a hero who comes with her own attachments, or one who can't even have them?..............I thought so.\nAJ: Glorfindel: haven't even tried Mablung yet and Glorfindel brought me through too many scenarios for me to turn my back on him now\nAK: Gimli: I like Celeborn and the Silvan, but my Gimli-Firefoot attachment deck gave him new life for me\nAL: Aragorn: still bitter that Hama beat Grima\nAM: Eomer: I play Eomer because he makes the game more enjoyable.  I don't play Dain because he makes the game less enjoyable.  Easy choice."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1350583","commentId":1350583,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1417243313,"content":"X: Legolas - Nori is restricted to dwarf decks and doesn't offer anything that you can't elsewhere in the spirit sphere. Legolas, though is an amazing attacker and offers an amazing benefit for doing his job. He also fits into a much larger range of decks.\n\n \n\nY: Eowyn - Bard only works in multiplayer and has wasted stats. Eowyn really doesn't have any wasted stats and can excel in both solo and multiplayer.\n\n \n\nZ: Elrohir - This is a tough choice, but leadership Boromir is only useful in Gondor decks, and even then he often doesn't deliver as much as you expect. Elrohir requires his brother, and some resource acceleration. A deck that has Elrohir requires a lot of specialization, but not as much as leadership Boromir. Also, I prefer readying to stat boosting.\n\n \n\nAA: Frodo Baggins - Another tough choice. I tend to favor readying, so leadership Aragorn gets an edge there, but Frodo has saved so many lives it isn't even funny. Also, the ability to defend without the risk of death while you're exhausted is close enough to readying in my book. Aragorn's readying is also expensive and restricted to certain timing, so you need some sort of resource acceleration and you're not necessarily sure if you need to ready so you can ready him when you won't need him. Elrohir's readying is just enough less restrictive to make it seem way better than Aragorn's. Finally, Aragorn's starting threat can be a big negative factor.\n\n \n\nAB: Elrond - I just finish saying that Aragorn's starting threat can be a negative factor, but I'm taking the 2nd highest threat hero with this pick. This is because he is able to make up for it. Even if you only use him for Vilya, you can probably justify him because that is so powerful. He is also able to cpntribute to just about any phase of the game. Thalin, on the other hand, has limited applicability. His main role is obviously to quest, but the lone willpower just feels like a waste. Also, the single point of damage can be negligible in many cases, though it can also make an enormous impact in other quests. Overall, I think Elrond is able to make more impact a higher percentage of the time.\n\n \n\nAC: Boromir (T) - Another tough choice, but I ultimately go with readying again. If Boromir's readying was limited to once or twice per round, Eleanor would probably win. Also, if Eleanor's ability didn't require you to replace the cancelled treachery, it'd fight much harder here. Tactics Boromir is just way too powerful to not win this though.\n\n \n\nAD: Prince Imrahil - Another tough choice decided by readying. Beregond offers a super solid defender right out of the gate and allows a user to buff him with free/cheaper armor or weapons. Prince Imrahil, though, has decent stats in each category and has readying, so he's far more versatile and with a single attachment (Gondorian Shield) performs quite well as a defender too.\n\n \n\nAE: Denethor - Bifur is a great hero because resource smoothing is important, but he has no standout stats, so he feels lackluster. Denethor, though, can defend well right away or can be a key component in an encounter manipulation deck. Both of them have very useful traits.\n\n \n\nAF: Sam Gamgee - Another super close one. Pippin opens up a lot of possibilities for secrecy decks, and since I semi-recently was on secrecy kick, I've played him much more. Sam is super good for his threat, though and offers a great low threat leadership hero with built in readying and stat boosting. Those are quite limited, but even if he can't ready, his 3 willpower is amazing. Pippin is a big key to secrecy, though...\n\n \n\nAG: Gandalf - Gandalf has amazing stats and a lot of wonderful toys, not to mention his ability to completely change the way you play by being neutral and being able to see the top card of your deck. Merry can work well if you need low threat and want to splash in tactics, or if you want to build a hobbit deck, or if you're trying to make Theoden worth playing, but other than that he doesn't bring much to the table.\n\n \n\nAH: Haldir of Lorien - Faramir is a walking contradiction and is too difficult to build around. Haldir, on the other hand, is exactly what you want in rangers and his ability allows him to kill things safely. No contest.\n\n \n\nAI: Galadriel - Galadriel is just so powerful. Locking your threat level (barring any \"doom\") and drawing an extra card each turn is extremely useful and opens up a lot of great deck types. Beorn is extremely powerful too, but he has much tougher drawbacks: no attachments, immune to player card effects. His built-in \"readying\" is great, though, and 5 base attack is insane, but I just can't take him over Galadriel, especially with such high starting threat.\n\n \n\nAJ: Glorfindel (S) - Mablung looks to be potentially very powerful. Glorfindel just won't be beat, though. Mablung tends to need more cards built around him, whereas Glorfindel really just needs Light of Valinor. Also, the fact that Glorfindel is in so many decks just speaks for itself.\n\n \n\nAK: Celeborn - This one is sorta tough. Celeborn is not very versatile in the types of decks he can show up in, but he is the top dog in a massively fun new faction archetype. Gimli fights quite valiantly for this spot, though, so it was tough to decide.\n\n \n\nAL: Aragorn (Lo) - The threat reset is insane. It would work a lot better on a low-threat hero, but I'll take what I can get from Aragorn. Hama's recycling can be a bore some times and he's very one-dimensional. Aragorn is more versatile.\n\n \n\nAM: Eomer - Dain is nothing by himself. He requires the rest of the dwarves to make a difference. Eomer isn't super versatile, but with just 1 attachment, he becomes a beast. I like beasts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1350588","commentId":1350588,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1417244511,"content":"X - Legolas\n\nY - Eowyn\n\nZ - Boromir (Ld)\n\nAA - Frodo\n\nAB - Elrond\n\nAC - Boromir (T)\n\nAD - Beregond\n\nAE - Denethor\n\nAF - Sam Gamgee\n\nAG - Gandalf\n\nAH - Haldir of Lorien\n\nAI - Galadriel\n\nAJ - Mablung\n\nAK - Celeborn\n\nAL - Aragorn (Lo)\n\nAM - Eomer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1350612","commentId":1350612,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1417249667,"content":">  \n> \n> > All Hama voters will feel my wrath!

But Eowyn is still now the best questing hero...\n\n \n\nZ: Elrohir: Give him an Steward of Gondor, a Gondorian shield and you have provably the best defender of the game.\n\n \n\nAA: Frodo: In the right deck... with enough threat control is a life assurance.\n\n \n\nAB: Elrond: Nothing to say... probably it will be the more unbalanced match .\n\n \n\nAC: Boromir: If Eleanor would'nt reveal another card she would win. But as they are... I think Boromir is better.\n\n \n\nAD: Prince Imrahil: 0 WP sucks.\n\n \n\nAE: Denethor: Until we don't get another hero with a scrying ability... he is so good at what he does.\n\n \n\nAF: Sam Gamgee: Very very hard choice... I first wrote Pippin... but really, having a deep analysis Sam is just to good for it's 8 threat.\n\n \n\nAG: Gandalf: Gandalf and all his toys are just... too good. And this is a signal, look at the round code... (ag, on the reverse side is (GA from Gandalf...)\n\n \n\nAH: Haldir of Lorien (I forgot to vote, so I edited the post): I also like Faramir... but what you want in a ranger deck is a way to end enemies on the staging area, not a boost for having them...\n\n \n\nAI: Galadriel: Sad to look this paired, as they both are amongst my favourite heroes... but I have to choose one...\n\n \n\nAJ: Glorfindel: Better stats. Half threat, Asfaloth... that's too much for Mablung\n\n \n\nAK: Celeborn: I'm not a great fan of Gimli, and Celeborn is the cornerstone of one of the most fun decks at the moment...\n\n \n\nAL: Aragorn: Best threat control ability on the game. I'm a fan of Hama, but you had a hard match dude, sorry.\n\n \n\nAM: Eomer: Looking at the numbers, stats and effectiveness, Dain is provably better. But Eomer is great, original and has good sinergies without beeing overpowered as dwarves are. My choice and one of my favourites to be in the finals.\n\nEdited November 29, 2014 by wehehe"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1350708","commentId":1350708,"userName":"Veve7","timestamp":1417261445,"content":"X-Nori\n\nY-Eowyn\n\nZ-Boromir(Le)\n\nAA-Aragorn(Le)\n\nAB-Elrond\n\nAC-Boromir(T)\n\nAD-Beregond\n\nAE-Denethor\n\nAF-Pippin(Lo)\n\nAG-Gandalf\n\nAH-Haldir of Lorien\n\nAI-Galadriel\n\nAJ-Glorfindel(S)\n\nAK-Gimli\n\nAL-Aragorn(Lo)\n\nAM-Dain Iroonfoot"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1350837","commentId":1350837,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1417272711,"content":"X legolas\n\nY eowyn\n\nZ elrohir\n\nAA frodo\n\nAB elrond\n\nAC eleanor\n\nAD beregond\n\nAE bifur\n\nAF pippin\n\nAG gandalf\n\nAH haldir\n\nAI galadriel\n\nAJ mablung\n\nAK celeborn\n\nAL aragorn\n\nAM eomer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1350856","commentId":1350856,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1417274518,"content":"X: Legolas\n\nY- Eowyn\n\nZ - Elrohir\n\nAA - Frodo\n\nAB - Thalin, tough call since Elrond is a powerhouse, but I dislike Vilya and really love Thalin so ...\n\nAC- Boromir (T)\n\nAD- Beregond, but tough again.\n\nAE- Bifur, cheaper and makes it easy to run just 1 lore\n\nAF- Pippin, easy!\n\nAG- Merry, no fun in playing Gandalf.\n\nAH-Haldir\n\nAI- Beorn (didn't play Galadriel yet)\n\nAJ- Glorfindel\n\nAK - Celeborn\n\nAL- Aragorn (Le)\n\nAM- Dain\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127748-the-hero-championship-2014/?do=findComment&comment=1350863","commentId":1350863,"userName":"TheRealGreenman","timestamp":1417275131,"content":"Second round....
