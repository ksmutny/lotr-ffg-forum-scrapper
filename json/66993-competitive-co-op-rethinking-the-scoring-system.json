What is deck supposed to do? Win. I know that the current (official) system does not take into account win/loss ratio and that there are alternate added methods to take this into account, but they still allow a focus on a deck that can win occasionally with a great score but has a relatively poor win percentage. This cannot work in a tournament setting where you only have a limited number of games and is overall, I think a bad way to view deck design. I propose that in any scoring system winning a scenario should be paramount and that any scoring system should be average score of all games played. A deck that wins every game with 49 threat and 1 Health left for each hero is better than a deck that wins 1 in 5 in 3 turns with a 0 threat and no damage. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66993-competitive-co-op-rethinking-the-scoring-system/?do=findComment&comment=653676","commentId":653676,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1341396757,"content":"I saw a scroing system which uses something you described.\n\nPlayer forms a deck, plays a scenario 3 times, scoring each won at the end.\n\nThen, he sums all his scores and divides by amount of wins. Then he miltiplies the result by 1+0.5*Losses. \n\nSo, for example I won 2 times in the scenario, resulting in 146 and 184 scores. The averge will be 146+185=330/2=165.\n\nNow, because I lost 1 time, I 165*1.5=247,5. Thats my ranking score.\n\nLets now take the guy who had the worse scores but won all 3 times.\n\nLet it be 158, 173 and 195. 158+173+195=526/3=175,3.\n\nSince he didn't lost a singe time, 175,3 will be his ranking score."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66993-competitive-co-op-rethinking-the-scoring-system/?do=findComment&comment=653691","commentId":653691,"userName":"just Logan","timestamp":1341398527,"content":"I agree with but I also think the entire format for scoring supports certain deck types which is unfair.

Like a football match. You win together and loose together.\n \nOR maybe like this:\n1. Regarding victory points. Could the answer be as simple as just ad a zero to the point on the card? Ex. 4 vic. points = 40 points. How well would that work?\n \n2. Regarding tournament scoring. How about making some point criteria instead of just make the one with less point win?

In the current scoring system a primary function of many cards and decks (combat) only results in a secondary effect on scoring. It seems that to prevent large scale cheating and victory manipulation the games would have to be set up where you could score individual decks playing at the same table. Where even 2 decks cooperating to win were still competing to be more effective. I was looking for alternative ways to score so that a competitive environment could be possible. After trying a few things and looking at the record keeping and maths involved I don't really think that this would be possible. Given this and based on FFG's lack of sportsmanship rules resulting in a legal tournament win based on some one throwing a game to let some one win in AGOT I think I will have to toss the idea and accept that for the LCGs I play I will not get to play in tournaments. \n\n \n\n "}]}
