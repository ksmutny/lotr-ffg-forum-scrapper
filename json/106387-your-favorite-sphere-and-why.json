It does card drawing, scrying and healing better than any other sphere. It also has some great unique allies (Gléowine, Haldir of Lórien, Gildor Inglorion and Anborn to name a few) and attachments (Thror's Map, Ranger Spikes, Ranger Bow and Protector of Lórien). Most of all, I like the tricks that Lore allows which change the game. Asfaloth, Denethor, Elf-stone, Ithilien Tracker and A Burning Brand all have the potential to fundamentally alter the way the game is played. To sum it up, I feel like Lore often gives you more decisions, and particularly more interesting decisions, than the other spheres.\n\nEdited May 16, 2014 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106387-your-favorite-sphere-and-why/?do=findComment&comment=1086798","commentId":1086798,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1400221095,"content":"Lore would definitely come in close second, mainly because I love using rangers and traps.

Love them. However, I still feel like Tactics is far, far behind. For some time, during the AtS cycle, I was torn but when the Fellowship saga came, or the VoI, I was sure again. Tactics is far, far behind, with Lore also lacking strides, I would say. Tactics is still very weak solo but I would not say they are best as a supportive deck, either. In a majority of quests it is more beneficial just to build up your numbers than use the subtle finesse of direct damage or feint moves. Then, Lore is also weak solo but good in coop. Spirit I think has the most powerful cards overall but Leadership can handle it both solo and coop very well.\n\n \n\nNow, I know I was not answering the thread question. I am often with the underdogs, I really want to see great cards for the spheres I find less capable, Lore and Tactics.

For solo then clearly (expect for a few quests) mono tactics will struggle.\n\nBest mono decks are lore and leadership for solo.

Mono spirit solo is hard (but better then tactics) mainly be you lack attack power.\n\nFor multiplayer though I have always felt that the way the gsme was meant to be played was 4 mono sphere decks with 4 players.
