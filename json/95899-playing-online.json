I'm just wondering if anyone has put together a program to play online, something like what's available for AGOT.

You can play with lots of gamers around the world in any hour. You can meet with your friends by online if you can't physically. Also, you can know new gamers, but lotr is not too usually than netrunner or magic. But it is good, if you have patience you just get playing.\n\nA few time ago, i tried Lackey, but it runs slowly and it seems have problems, and a very few gamers. OCTGN i think is better.\n\n \n\nIf you are thinking to play OCTGN..., let's go! Welcome!!! If lotr has more players online, it surely becomes funnier, and easier to play as a world-player-community"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95899-playing-online/?do=findComment&comment=948008","commentId":948008,"userName":"Legoland","timestamp":1389114356,"content":"I tried it a few times but find it very difficult to create the decks.
