Does his ability trigger only if the enemy is optionally engaged or whenever he engages because it has been stated that if you engage an enemy or you are engaged they are the same thing (like Hummerhons).\n\n \n\n2. If you have multiple enemies can his ability of +1 stats accumulate or does it depends on him readying?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86761-sam-gamgee-ability/?do=findComment&comment=818542","commentId":818542,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1374426092,"content":"1.in the normal sense, i would say that given that the enemy needs to be higher then it would be impossible to trigger the ability if an enemy engaged you- they would have a lower threat.. ...however this doesnt answer the question of if a card affect forces an enemy to engage you...then i would say that it does work\n\n \n\n2.as in my pippin/sam/son or arnor thread, there is nothing stopping the effects building up, regardless of him being exhausted\n\n \n\njust my ideas\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86761-sam-gamgee-ability/?do=findComment&comment=818692","commentId":818692,"userName":"Alex6222","timestamp":1374447161,"content":"Thanks for the reply, i think i need to pay more attention to the card because when you put it that way it becomes very clear."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86761-sam-gamgee-ability/?do=findComment&comment=818833","commentId":818833,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1374465366,"content":"The buff part of the text dose not rely on the rest of the card effect. You can see this easy as it is a separate sentence. So you can buff him with every engagement. Remember that each player can only optionally engage once per turn. So you can only choose to engage 1 enemy, thus only buff once. Though there are some tricks to do more engagements if you need. Any mods that forcibly engage do not trigger of course as they are not higher threat than Sam."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86761-sam-gamgee-ability/?do=findComment&comment=821736","commentId":821736,"userName":"OnkelZorni","timestamp":1374759216,"content":"ffg_goblin-follower-kd.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_goblin-follower-kd.jpg]\n\n \n\nThis is an example of auto-engagement with higher-threat enemies (assuming your threat is less than 33).\n\nSam's buff would trigger here"}]}
