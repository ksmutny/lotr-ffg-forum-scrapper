I've never played it so can't review it.\n\nThere's also a standalone (\"print on demand\") adventure called the Stone of Erech which involves the Dead Men. I have played this and can tell you that it's excellent. One of the best created actually.  \n\nHope that helps!\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265076-newbie-question/?do=findComment&comment=3118547","commentId":3118547,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1512908924,"content":"> 2 hours ago, JonG said:\n> \n> There's a scenario in the Flame of the West scenario pack called the Forbidden Door which involves them.\n\nHuh?\n\nThe quest is called Passing of the Grey Company.
