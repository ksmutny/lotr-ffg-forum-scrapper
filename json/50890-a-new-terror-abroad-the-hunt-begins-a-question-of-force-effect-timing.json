And if I read the Rules correctly the question Characters are considered Commited until the end of the Quest Phase.\n\nCorrect?\n\nA New Terror Abroad - Does this Forced Effect take place before any characters can \"commit\" to the Quest?\n\nI think it does, but at the same time the Questing Phase starts with Characters committing... so there is a small chance the timing can be chosen as per the FAQ (1.02) Simultaneous Effect Timing.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n/wolf"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50890-a-new-terror-abroad-the-hunt-begins-a-question-of-force-effect-timing/?do=findComment&comment=508122","commentId":508122,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1312338830,"content":" I consider characters committed to the quest until the travel phase begins.\n\nI also have the forced effect take place before committing to questing on A New Terror.  I go with the argument that committing to a quest doesn't trigger the start of the questing phase, it's just the first thing you do unless there is some kind of response that happens at the beginning of the questing phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50890-a-new-terror-abroad-the-hunt-begins-a-question-of-force-effect-timing/?do=findComment&comment=508125","commentId":508125,"userName":"GhostWolf69","timestamp":1312339300,"content":"Kiwina said:\n\n I consider characters committed to the quest until the travel phase begins.\n\nI also have the forced effect take place before committing to questing on A New Terror.  I go with the argument that committing to a quest doesn't trigger the start of the questing phase, it's just the first thing you do unless there is some kind of response that happens at the beginning of the questing phase.\n\n\n\nSo we have the same take on this.
