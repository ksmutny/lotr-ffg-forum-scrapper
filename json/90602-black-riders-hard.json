It seemed like readying is going to be really important to deal with the questing and any potential hide tests that came up. I was lucky to get 2 fast hitches early in the game. I put one on Sam and the other on Frodo. I would Quest with them and Pippin form7 and if a hide test came up, i would be able to ready Sam and Frodo for at 5 WP. Of course later i had some more questing power. The tactics event halfling Determination and Frodo's intuition cards were really great for a willpower boost. With the heroes i had Cram could also be useful. If you have a spirit hero. You have a lot mor readying options. I also used the Mr. Underhill Boon once and a couple of Feints on the Black Riders throughout the scenario.\n\nI wish i could find a good way to include a spirit hero with these hobbits, but the 3 of them seem like such a good fit, i think it's going to be hard to split them up. I'm going to need to keep tweaking the hobbit deck, there are lot's of possibilities, and too many good cards to choose from."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873314","commentId":873314,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1379951985,"content":"> Isn't Hail of Stones an auto-include for every tactics deck? :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]\n\nI've never included it in a deck before because most of my decks until now haven't included a lot of allies to use.\n\n \n\nHenceforth I'm calling the card Hail of Apple Cores."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873385","commentId":873385,"userName":"Spurries","timestamp":1379956584,"content":">  \n> \n> > Took you mind posting a recap of your quest 1?  Im using that deck and have a bunch of trouble with it.  Got to quest 3 once but failed Hide Tests hurt me.\n> \n> I wouldn't mind, but I don't remember all of the details either.  Are you leaving the Riders in the staging area and not engaging them?  You have to kill them-\n> \n>  \n> \n> Oh no, you can't kill them!\n> \n>  \n> \n> Ok, you have to drive them off as soon as you can.  Save your Sneaky Gandalves for the 4 points of damage, engage, ready Sam, draw a card, play the Feint or Quick Strike you've saved (and maybe an Unseen Strike too if you don't have Gandalf) and send the Rider to the discard pile.\n> \n>  \n> \n> As far as Hide tests go, get a Fast Hitch on Sam and use him and Frodo to Hide.  Discard cards to the Protector of Lorien (that you've put on Frodo) or play Frodo's Initiative to make sure you don't fail.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I have a pretty busy week ahead and probably won't play again until next weekend.\n> \n>  \n\nCool thanks , yea basically what Im doing, think ive been getting unlucky encounter deck, just actually beat it with a decent draw, but for your strategy of quick striking, what character do you have using that?  No one attacks for more than 4(Black Rider's defense) unless you attach the Daggers, which the deck you referenced doesnt include(although unseen strikes work fine here)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873407","commentId":873407,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1379958022,"content":"I was using the deck I mentioned stock for the first quest.  (Sam, Pippin, Merry)  I added Hail of Apple Cores for the second.  Anyway, Merry attacks for 4, which takes care of the defense value.  Sam will ready and be attacking for 2 more.  If you have popped the rider for 4 on a Sneak Attack that will drive him off.  Or use Unseen Strike and another character."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873788","commentId":873788,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1379988067,"content":"I finished off all 3 scenarios.

All this and the Tireless ranger defense, Sam can safely defend for 11 when he is all primed up defending a higher engament cosy enemy.\n\nSimilarly with Merry. Two daggers and 3 Dunedain Marks, your looking at 11 attack, without engagement bonus he is at 9 atk.\n\nPoor Pippin doesn't get anything, but his abilities are really what makes the deck work. The card draw is great too.\n\nFor questing it's pretty much Sam, Frodo, Pippin, and Merry when he gets a Fast Hitch. That's 9 WP. Sam with Celebrians stone and Bill the Pony bring that to a solid 12 each round.\n\nThese Hobbits really don't need much help from anyone else, as long as Gandalf shows up every once and awhile there all set.\n\nEdited September 25, 2013 by Tracker1"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873802","commentId":873802,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1379989937,"content":"I like your deck.

I really thought we would be getting more of the Big name heroes as allies in these expansions. II am hoping to get all the characters as either heroes or allies from the fellowship for a solo deck, but that's probably just a pipe dream.\n\nAs for theme, the second scenario is great. You really feel like you are fighting for your life on top of Weathertop. I think they really nailed that scenario, each transition between quest cards is perfect in telling the story.\n\nEdited September 24, 2013 by Tracker1"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=874378","commentId":874378,"userName":"Spurries","timestamp":1380052183,"content":"Nice deck Tracker per usual.  Just played the first scenario and Merry was swinging for 11 by the end of it haha.  Sam was at 6 defense."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=874610","commentId":874610,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1380072375,"content":"> Nice deck Tracker per usual.

Is your threat over 39 by that point? Remember Pippins's ability. Usually, I am able to take one rider at a time, and I usually start with the Witch king. By this point in the game you want to have Merry and Sam almost maxed out with attachments, and it's nice to have a feint and Mr. Underhill ready go. Also, there is nothing in the win conditions that says you need to travel to Weathetop, so don't at least when the riders show up. If you do you will get Slaughtered, after you exhaust the ring to travel there. You will have a lot of threat in the staging area next round, but I like to try and have a Gandalf sneak attack to help, hopefully Gildor lore ally is in play too. Frodo's Intuition can really help out to. It's best to use Gandalf to lower threat, but in a few games I have had to use him and a a hail of stones to take out Bill Ferney.\n\nThis is my favorite quest of the three. There seems to be a lot of strategic decisions to make. I like the Locations that help you out.

We need ally versions of the Fellowship members. (Sans Gandalf.)\n\nI second that. Ally versions of some heroes would be great, but i think it is unlikely we will get many if any. It would satisfy the solo deck builder to get all fellowship members into one deck, but I think the designers lean more towards synergies between 2 or more decks, so assuming we can have 2 decks with 6 of the fellowship heroes already +Gandalf ally, and the set will probably also come with another Frodo hero, so between 2 decks you get 8 characters from the Fellowship. Which means we might see at least one member of the fellowship become an ally.\n\nI think we also have to consider that these boxes are designed for a player to only have the Core set and probably BR. So with those sets we already have all hobbits asuming frodo will be objective hero again. We also have Leogolas, Gimili, and Aragorn from the core as well as Gandalf ally. The only missing member is Boromir, so it is possible we will see him again as either ally or hero. Ally would be cool, but I would not be so happy to see him as a hero again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=917766","commentId":917766,"userName":"Boris_the_Dwarf","timestamp":1385564246,"content":"Tom Bombadil"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=952747","commentId":952747,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1389568710,"content":"finally got around to getting black riders...
