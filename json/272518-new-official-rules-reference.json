But reading the actual framework text on p. 22–23 clears it up, I think.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> 2.2 Planning action window\n> This is a special action window in which the active player (in addition to triggering standard action abilities) is permitted to play ally and attachment cards from his or her hand.\n> \n> …\n> \n> This action window remains open until all players consecutively pass, so that the active player has the opportunity to play as many ally and attachment cards as he or she desires and can afford at this time.\n\nThe implication here is that it is a regular action window, just one where the active player can play allies/attachments too. So, given what @Rouxxor [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/308704-rouxxor/]quoted above about action priorities, anally-correct play during Planning might progress like this (3-player game):\n\n> Quote\n> \n> A: I play Daeron's Runes. Passing action opportunity to B.\n> B: No action. Passing to C.\n> C: No action. Passing to A.\n> A: Now I play To the Sea! To the Sea! on my Arwen. Could use some more cards… Passing opportunity to B.\n> B: Nothing; passing to C.\n> C: I play Deep Knowledge. Passing opportunity to A.\n> A: 'k, thanks. Now I exhaust To the Sea and discard 4 cards. Pass opportunity.\n> B: No action. Pass to C.\n> C: Nope; pass to A.\n> A: OK, I play Glorfindel for 1.\n\nOverall, we don't need to be so crazy about it, we can just freely take actions as we always have. I think the chart should've made it a striped-red box or something to be a little less confusing.\n\n(I have assumed in the above that each time a player gains an opportunity to perform an action, they can perform only a single action, but I am unclear from the p. 20 wording whether the player can actually perform multiple actions in a row without passing the opportunity along. It should not matter in a cooperative game, of course.)\n\nEdited March 30, 2018 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/272518-new-official-rules-reference/?do=findComment&comment=3267068","commentId":3267068,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1522388595,"content":"Wow that’s actually kind of a big deal.

This is saying that the first player could use those resources to play an ally right away?\n\nTo elaborate slightly… The Steward can only be played by player 2 when he is the active player (which I am italicizing to emphasize that it is terminology defined in the RR). By definition, that is past the point when player 1 has been active that phase. So player 1 will no longer have the special privilege of playing an ally/attachment—this is the whole reason that the active state affects gameplay in the Planning phase. This is functionally the same as it was before.\n\nIn the entire exchange I posited above with players A/B/C, A is active. Merely passing the opportunity to perform an action does not by itself change who is active; that only happens when all players have passed consecutively. In real-world terms, this happens when a player has finished playing all their allies/attachments that they're going to."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/272518-new-official-rules-reference/?do=findComment&comment=3267235","commentId":3267235,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1522413874,"content":"> 54 minutes ago, sappidus said:\n> \n>  \n> \n> In the entire exchange I posited above with players A/B/C, A is active.
