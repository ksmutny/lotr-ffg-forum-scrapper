I guess the odd part out might be the rules booklet from A Shadow in The East so a safe option could be to ignore the booklet and put The One Ring in play in Step 7.\n\nEdited April 3 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306827-one-ring-discarded-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3924924","commentId":3924924,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1586269904,"content":"Would it kill Caleb to admit that protecting Guarded cards in step two isn't worth the grief?  I mean, nearly everyone is going to use Strider anyways!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306827-one-ring-discarded-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3924936","commentId":3924936,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1586271656,"content":"> 23 minutes ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Would it kill Caleb to admit that protecting Guarded cards in step two isn't worth the grief?  I mean, nearly everyone is going to use Strider anyways!\n\nSo true. I've always agreed with him about every other rule change or card errata but this...come on.\n\nI personally house rule that player cards with Setup  effects trigger during step 2 and The Grey Wanderer should read, \"Setup: Search your deck for a non-Guarded attachment with a printed cost of 1...\"\n\nI believe he also did this to make the Messenger of the King contract less OP.

There are some allies like Lindir that can make for some crazy starts.\n\nIf that was a motivation, it strikes me as a poor one.  Yes, it would allow Lindir to draw three cards at hero setup, not affected by the subsequent Mulligan -- but that's the only ability Lindir's got, so overpowered it is not.  I broke down the unique allies as MotK targets here:\n\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2377638/breaking-down-messenger-king-targets [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2377638/breaking-down-messenger-king-targets]\n\nPart III is the ones with \"enters play\" abilities, and Lindir is the *only* loser from the timing change -- a number of possible targets (LoFaramir, LoMablung, Meneldor, Tom Cotton) have quest-specific benefit from coming in later, and two (Orophin and Gwaihir) can benefit from Galdor's ability with the new timing.\n\nI suppose the new timing makes MotK decks weaker *in general* due to the chance you won't get the hero you wanted and designed the deck for -- but that comes at the expense of nerfing you before a quest begins for no particular reason and is about as unfun as possible."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306827-one-ring-discarded-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=3925128","commentId":3925128,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1586292634,"content":"> 4 hours ago, player3351457 said:\n> \n> Well, maybe not.
