Legolas, Haldir, Mirlonde! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Not that it was hard to call.\n\n \n\nThey can't do math, though: they think the deck starts with 23 threat, but it's 24. I'm also disappointed there were no spoilers. Supposedly only a few days left to wait, though.\n\n \n\nAnyway, I like this deck a lot better, but I don't think the resource balance leans enough toward lore. With all those 1-cost tactics cards, you could play one every rounds and I see it being very difficult to save up enough to put Rumil in play. I see this in my own decks as well, and I think this deck is even worse. I really like the Rain of Arrows + Pursuing the Enemy combo. 1 damage always feels so useless, but 2 on everyone could be pretty game changing and should allow you to only use 1 attacker per character against the enemies that survive. I was confused why they would bother with Rivendell Bow, but then I looked more closely and finally realized it isn't restricted. That's pretty cool, but it's still pretty weak at 1 resource for a conditional 1 damage. Adding ranged to a couple more allies seems like a solid option, but I like the idea of Haldir and/or Legolas being even more powerful :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png].\n\nEdited December 17, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129300-the-woodland-realms-unite-part-two/?do=findComment&comment=1370840","commentId":1370840,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1418869502,"content":"> meh\n\nhahahaaha I was going to post exactly this.\n\nIts a much better deck than the first one that pairs with it but still not as good as many of the ones on the forums or even my Noldor/Silvan mixed decks.
