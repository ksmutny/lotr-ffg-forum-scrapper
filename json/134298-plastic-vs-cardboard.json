I only see bad things in that choice, could it really warrant FFG to make this choice to save money and is it really any cheaper? There will still be the cardboard parts within the plastic so that seems like way more waste not to mention the beautiful collection this game once was but we now just get a bunch of ugly plastic :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\nSo for me the two most dissappinting things are: the collection now will look lame with this plastic and plastic is just a waste of resources compared to a renewable resource (trees)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134298-plastic-vs-cardboard/?do=findComment&comment=1439396","commentId":1439396,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1423345688,"content":"I'd much rather stick with the cardboard.

Also, all of the ink used in printing the outside of the cardboard AP boxes costs money. I doubt anyone prefers the plastic to the cardboard (I certainly don't) but I completely understand why they would make the change. Being able to lower the cost of production for your products is just good business sense.

However, with my collection growing I've taken most of the cards out of the boxes and into the core set via a custom insert. With the several empty boxes lying around I planned on cutting out the images and turning them into a collage of sorts, maybe something I could even hang up. Depending on how decent the remaining little bit of cardboard is in these plastic packages, FFG may have just made my whole \"art\" process a lot simpler. A bit of silver lining to it all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134298-plastic-vs-cardboard/?do=findComment&comment=1445210","commentId":1445210,"userName":"crx3800","timestamp":1423683095,"content":"It they are anything like the PoD stuff I've bought in the past, there is a least one 'title' card in the pack that doesn't do much.
