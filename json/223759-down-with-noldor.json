They were some very nice things admittedly, but not enough to outweigh the amount of Dunedain, and in general that cycle was just very well distributed between a lot of different things. Grey Havens was a Noldor box, but as I recall the news articles described it as being pretty much the capstone on the Noldor development from Angmar Awakened, and that lines up with what we've seen since - not much extra Noldor.\n\n \n\nThis cycle is giving boosts to all the other traits you mentioned. Also since you brought up the Dwarf comparison, while I don't have numbers on other card types, I'll mention that Dwarves still have the most heroes in the game - but by the end of the current cycle Gondor will have caught up with them.

Gamgee.\n\n \n\n15) Foolishly cooking the coneys attracts the attention of dangerous men -- fortunately led by Faramir, who suspends the law, spares their lives, and feeds them.\n\n \n\n16) Sam spills the beans to Faramir after he's filled with food and drink.  Faramir gives them counsel, staves, and food and water for the road.\n\n \n\n17) Merry first is in the same conversation with Eowyn at a feast, though the food may not have been ordered by Eowyn herself.  Eowyn confines herself to giving Merry rainment of war, so she's a bit of an exception.\n\n \n\n18) Beregond, on the other hand, gets food for Pippin on their first meeting, and later brings him to meet his company, who \"gave him as much food and ale as he could wish.\"\n\n \n\n19) Sam wishes the Lady Galadriel could give him sunlight and clean water.  And gets it.\n\n \n\n20) The rescue of Frodo and Sam by Gandalf and the Eagles was not directly associated with food, although they do get a light meal fed to them directly before proceeding to the Field of Cormallen.\n\n \n\nAll in all, I'd have to say that food has positive connotations in LOTR, and the player card \"A Good Meal\" is a good thematic fit.  Having an encounter card that punishes the party for the Hobbit's joy of the table would be a poor fit for the text, I think."}]}
