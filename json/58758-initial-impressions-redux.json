out again.\n\nFrom what I learnt last time, and from reading various forums, solo play is too hard, 4 players is too easy.  A lot of people were saying that it works best with 2.  Luckily for me, it was just me and the g/f, so we were away.\n\nThe plan was to build us a deck each and play through each scenario individually.\n\nI bought one core set, but made proxy cards so I had 3 of every card.  The decks I made up I thought were pretty good.\n\n \n\nScenario 1:  A walkover.  I think we beat it in 3 or 4 turns it was that easy.  Maybe we were lucky on cards, but I remember playing this a few times months ago and remembered that was also easy too.\n\nOpinion: The scenario is a bit too easy for 2 players with a constructed deck.  This was probably intentional so that people can play the starter decks against it and the game is therefore playable right out of the box.  I have no issue with this.  For me, this scenario is just to help learn the game.\n\n \n\nScenario 2:  We have played this twice now and lost both times.  In both games, it appeared we were doing ok, but then things just got away from us.  Game 1 we died due to threat.  Game 2 we just ended up with wounds galore everywhere, and then when a treachery card killed Glorfindel, and another one killed Aragorn, we conceded.\n\nOpinion: The scenario is tough.  I remember beating it before, back in August, but I cant remember with what decks or how many players.\n\n \n\nAnd onto the reason for my post:  I like the game, I love the artwork, I love that it is co-op and that me and the g/f can sit down and work together at trying to work out what the best thing to do it.\n\nHowever, it is the deck and the cards that I'm finding doesnt sit well.  One of the nice things I like about some of the newer card games (GoT / CoC) is that you get 2 cards per turn.  This gives far more flexibility in game play.  So, when I got LotR and realised it was 1 card per turn in a 50 card deck, I was a little disappointed.\n\nIn both of our attempts at Scenario 2, the game lasted between 8 and 10 rounds.  This means we were about 15-16 cards through our 50 card deck.  I have a problem with this for a couple of reasons.\n\nWhat is the point in going to all the effort to build a 50 card deck when we see less than half of it?  I know the ratios and stuff like that, but it seems a lot of effort to make my 50 cards up, sleeve them, shuffle them, etc and only see 16 of them.\n\nThe other bigger issue is that because we only saw 16 out of our 50 cards, the game was more down to the luck of the draw.  In the second game, we died because there were a lot of wounds.  \"I need more healing cards\" I said, and went to tweak my deck.  But, I had them all in there, they just didnt come out.   We both have 3 Gandalf cards, and we only saw 1 of them.  If we'd seen 2 (one each), the game would have been completely different.\n\nSo, whilst I know that constructing a better deck will give us the chance of doing better, it is a bit demoralising to put the effort into building the 50 card deck, when I'm not going to see most of what I put in there.\n\n \n\nJust thought I'd see if I was doing something wrong...  thanks

believe there is a simple solution to this- i get that your onw main problem is card draw correct? one thing that immediatly comes to mind is that there are quite a few event/ally card draws out there...\n\ngildor\n\nloriens wealth,\n\ngandalfs search\n\ngleowine\n\nmustering the rohirrim\n\ngandalf\n\nancient mathom\n\nthe eagles are coming\n\nvalient sacrfice\n\n \n\n \n\ncards like these all let you boost your card draw by quite  bit, and search through your deck- also my favourite for this is bilbo-he lets you draw 2 cards per turn instead of 1, and this was sort of the gist of the problem i gt from your post, so if you include these cards then i can guarentee you will see more of your deck, as this was the point in the cards design\n\nps. i realise some of the exmples are in the adventure packs, so i guess my point is that it gets better if you invest in the game......which you may or may not now want to do\n\n \n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58758-initial-impressions-redux/?do=findComment&comment=577730","commentId":577730,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1326227364,"content":"Let's

That matches my experience. However, as others have pointed out, my solution was to pay more attention to and include Lore cards, specifically those that allow you to draw additional cards or search your deck for cards.

I mean what card games are you playing were you go though your entire deck? Defiantly not and of the LCGs or Magic the Gathering, I mean you might now and then.. but then sometimes people do in this game as well. As for card draw there is a deck called cycles that is designed for nightmare mode, the entire point of that deck is to draw all 50 cards into your hand at once as quickly as possible and then cycle using will of the est so every time you draw a card you are just drawing your best events and allies.

One of the things (I was talking about this in another thread) is the fact that the score system dose not take into account failed quests.

You will find if you make a more stable deck, as in one that wins nearly 100% of the time, your score will go down... but your win percentage will go up AND at the same time the game itself will slow.. allowing more of the encounter cards to be seen as well as your own deck.\n\nYou mentioned 2 player.. well a great way to start a simple draw engine is to run Bilbo and Beravor and Brand on the players team opposite Beravor. Bilbo will allow the 1st player to draw 2 cards a turn no matter what, adding card advantage to both players, and brand will be able to untap beravor each turn, with out even the need to put a UC on her you are drawing 6 cards a turn form turn 1.

As you say With Brand ,Bilbo, Beravur and Courage in co-op game you can wn sometimes too easy. And game is really boring with that. NIghtamare mode invented for hard core players just doesn work cose in the end is more simple then normal game.( I has already explain before how in Nightmare mode you can choose your starting hand form quest to quest is extremely powerful advantage).\n\nIm sure for the tournaments play should be some restricted list ans additional rules.\n\nBefore i complain a lot about difficult level and unbalanced card but now with RTM and KD release the game much more balanced (At least for solo game).Im more  happy now then before.\n\nSo if you look on the begin of the game and current time, you will see designers make they job better. I think this cycle should be much better then first one and maybe soon they will invent the tournaments system."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58758-initial-impressions-redux/?do=findComment&comment=579923","commentId":579923,"userName":"snaggrriss","timestamp":1326660548,"content":"with brevor and lore you can run out of cards to draw with a 50 card deck. once i was wishing i added 65."}]}
