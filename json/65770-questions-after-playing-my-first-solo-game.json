You move on to the next quest stage as soon as sufficient quest tokens have been placed on the previous one (and any other requirements are also met). Typically, this will be during the quest phase but it can happen at other times (eg from Legolas' effect).\n\n2. It depends which of the two 3B stages you have randomly drawn.\n\nDon't Leave the Path requires you to defeat Ungoliant's Spawn and therefore you win the moment this happens.\n\nBeorn's Path requires you to place 10 progress and to have got rid of Ungoliant's Spawn if she has entered play - you don't have to find and kill it, only defeat it if it has shown up via encounter deck draws.\n\nIn neither case do you have to defeat any other enemies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65770-questions-after-playing-my-first-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=666602","commentId":666602,"userName":"facie","timestamp":1343747935,"content":"Another newbie follow up.\n\nAssume that I'm exploring a location with a required quest progress of 2.  I manage to get 3 progress tokens.  I've been playing that I put 2 on the location, which explores it, and then immediately place the third token on the main quest. \n\nIs that correct? \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65770-questions-after-playing-my-first-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=666610","commentId":666610,"userName":"Beast Rabban","timestamp":1343749006,"content":"That is correct.
