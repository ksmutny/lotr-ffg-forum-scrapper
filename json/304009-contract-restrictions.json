The Grey Wanderer has to do with choosing heroes, so I am going to disregard that one. With The Burglar's Turn and Forth, the Three Hunters, the restriction of the deck are on attachments and allies, respectively.\n\nOnce the card is flipped, this no longer applies, correct? So if you can somehow manage to get attachments/allies into your deck, it is perfectly legal at that point, correct? Some \"message from elrond & drinking song\" combo, or something?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304009-contract-restrictions/?do=findComment&comment=3861406","commentId":3861406,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1578082826,"content":"Theoretically I agree, there is no reason why you couldn't end up with said cards shuffled into your deck. \n\nThe contracts still have much ambiguity about them. I would argue that the term \"Your deck cannot include...\" is intended to refer only to the deck you build to start the game, not it's state during the game, but whether that would ever be a practical concern is another matter."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304009-contract-restrictions/?do=findComment&comment=3867755","commentId":3867755,"userName":"bdavis969","timestamp":1578681104,"content":"Since contracts aren't unique, can the same contract be played by each player?
