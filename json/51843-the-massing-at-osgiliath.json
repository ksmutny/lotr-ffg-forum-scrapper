Note, the quality is less, but certainly not \"bad\".  I think it is safe to assume they were Print on Demand products.  Our game group returned home with 3 copies, one of which we're keeping to play and the other two we've already sold on eBay.  We grossed $152 between the two auctions.  And while we're extremely happy, we're also shocked by the results. Prices have already started to drop, as more folks push their cards onto eBay in an attempt to join the \"gold rush\". \n\nThe only thing these cards may have going for them, over the soon to be released POD product, are the two \"bookend\" cards which contain the Gen Con 2011 logo (and don't affect play at all).  I would assume the new POD products will contain something different, but I could certainly be wrong."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51843-the-massing-at-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=517277","commentId":517277,"userName":"Klaen","timestamp":1313789102,"content":"More than anything I think the crazy prices M@Og [M@Og] is getting on ebay is a reflection of human impatience with a dash of collectors fever added in.\n\nWe have been told the set will be available via POD, I'm guessing it's not going to be anymore than $30 US, why be impatient and pay over double what it's really going to be worth? \n\nHaving only just receieved Gollum, I'm happy to wait.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51843-the-massing-at-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=517480","commentId":517480,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1313841038,"content":"Klaen said:\n\nMore than anything I think the crazy prices M@Og [M@Og] is getting on ebay is a reflection of human impatience with a dash of collectors fever added in.\n\nWe have been told the set will be available via POD, I'm guessing it's not going to be anymore than $30 US, why be impatient and pay over double what it's really going to be worth? \n\nHaving only just receieved Gollum, I'm happy to wait.\n\n \n\n\n\nmy guess is a lot of people might not know that it'll be POD -- otherwise, why pay over $100?!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51843-the-massing-at-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=517493","commentId":517493,"userName":"Slipstream","timestamp":1313844962,"content":"As long as they are printed for legibility, I don't mind if the POD are of lesser quality.
