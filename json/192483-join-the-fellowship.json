But I think co-op games like LotR may be even more problematic. Even though they may have many fans, and make lots of sells, I suspect people overall buy co-op expansions at a slower rate than they do with the competitive ones. Competitive players tend to want to expand their cardpools as rapidly and as fully as possible, while that's not as necessary to enjoy playing something like LotR.\n\n \n\nThere could be darker reasons too... Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for a store to claim they are hosting such an event, only to actually not hold an event and just claim/sell the swag. Such \"business practices\" have been responsible for me dropping two of my FLGSs over the years."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192483-join-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1875183","commentId":1875183,"userName":"X_BryGuy_X","timestamp":1446482165,"content":"Is there a list of stores that I can peruse to find one in my area or do I just need to call around?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192483-join-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1876592","commentId":1876592,"userName":"Alatarvinyamar","timestamp":1446560179,"content":"Is it possible to get this if your FLGS is not participating?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192483-join-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1876688","commentId":1876688,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1446563881,"content":"They will be available POD eventually."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192483-join-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1877459","commentId":1877459,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1446590124,"content":"Just not Legolas or the play mat =(\n\nIf anyone ends up with a spare copy of this quest (with or without alt art legolas and playmats) for any reason I would pay handsomely for it!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192483-join-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1880773","commentId":1880773,"userName":"gamestar10","timestamp":1446753265,"content":"What's the selling point to a local FLGS to run such an event when they don't sell the LotR LCG product?
