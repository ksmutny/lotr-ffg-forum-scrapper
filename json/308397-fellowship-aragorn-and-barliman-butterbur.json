Good point.

He said according to the rules you can’t, but go ahead anyway, as I recall. \n\nFWIW, what I remember here is Matt Newman (in 2016) saying it was OK to use Strider for full value even if a Saga hero pushed you over the limit:\n\nHowever, Caleb later ruled (in 2019) that he would not be so generous:\n\n\n\n> Do \"Strider\" and other \"if you control 2 heroes\" cards like \"Vanish From Sight\" ignore Baggins/Fellowship heroes? Because those cards can sadly seldom be used in Saga Expansions (or well, yes, multiplayer, when the Saga hero changes of player) whereas some decks can be built around those cards. The issue is even worse on solo, of course.\n> \n> A saga hero (Bilbo or Frodo) is still a hero. So if you have 2 heroes + a saga hero, then you have 3 heroes.\n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308397-fellowship-aragorn-and-barliman-butterbur/?do=findComment&comment=3939548","commentId":3939548,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1589482893,"content":"ah well, thanks for digging those up"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308397-fellowship-aragorn-and-barliman-butterbur/?do=findComment&comment=3939612","commentId":3939612,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1589491218,"content":"Caleb, King of the Grim Rule"}]}
