your friends just prefer competitive games, then there isn't much else to say about it.  They aren't going to like LotR as much as just about any other CCG/LCG.  I enjoy Warhammer quite a bit, more than any other CCG I've played, but LotR is an ok change of pace.  I still prefer a competitive game, but LotR is something I can play with my wife, which is a big plus.  I also enjoy deckbuilding, and there just aren't enough options yet in LotR to hold my interest. \n\nThe solo play of LotR should have been a big plus, but I feel like most solo games are just driven by the luck of the encounter deck draw.  Its not like I can just \"play better\" and beat the scenarios, or tweak my decks until they are good enough.  Even the best decks currently constructed aren't going to beat the 3rd scenario solo without a ton of luck.  This will change with a larger card pool of course, and I can see getting more into solo at that point."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46215-competitive-coop/?do=findComment&comment=464088","commentId":464088,"userName":"servant of the secret

because it's cooperative doesn't mean it couldn't be competitive.  The easiest way I see is to have 2 encounter decks for a 2v2 competition.  1 is shuffled and the other would be mirrored to that deck by a 3rd party so each encounter would basically be the same with the exception of how each team handles their encounter with their deck-dependent play and overall strategy.  You would need to play out of ear-shot of the other team and the 3rd party could officiate.\n\nJust
