You can have more than one attachment and Unexpected courage doesn't restrict who it is attached to other than that they be a hero, so having this attached won't stop you attaching Unexpected Courage.\n\nBut maybe you wonder if it hinders you using Unexpected Courage?\n\nIt does not. Firstly, the restriction/effect is only during the Refresh phase not at other times, so you can absolutely ignore this text during any other phase. Secondly, there is a big difference between \"does not\" and \"cannot\"; \"does not\" is much weaker and really only prevents expected occurrences while \"cannot\" is very strong and prevents almost everything. So even if you were inclined to use Unexpected Courage's trigger effect during the Refresh phase, you shouldn't have to pay 2 resources to do so.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/257581-attachments-on-an-exhausted-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2960668","commentId":2960668,"userName":"caribecards","timestamp":1504113368,"content":"Thanks for the clarifications."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/257581-attachments-on-an-exhausted-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2968904","commentId":2968904,"userName":"hengst2404","timestamp":1504612378,"content":"Wow, great question that I encountered last night during my first ever game.
