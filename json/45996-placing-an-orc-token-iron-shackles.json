I don't think that would apply when you are turning the top card of your deck into an Enemy. Drawing is described on page 12 under the Resource Phase. \n\nOut of the Dungeons says \"each player places the top card of his deck\" I don't think that counts as Drawing cards. \n\n \n\nEDIT: \n\nI suppose that means you can still might be able to use Gandalf's Search while the Iron Shackles are on your deck because that is a search effect not a draw effect. That might be wrong however."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45996-placing-an-orc-token-iron-shackles/?do=findComment&comment=461205","commentId":461205,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1304100922,"content":"Yeah, I just ran across Iron Shackles for the first time last night and just found it generally odd. I think it creates a lot of strange situations ruleswise and definitely needs to be reworded/clarified/FAQed/whatever."}]}
