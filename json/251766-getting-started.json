Probably at least two people most of the time. And hopefully 4 players sometimes. So the product is confusing to me. I have a general idea of how the game works and I want decent decks to start with. So 2 Cores is must right? Plus I think the limited card pool with copies of good cards can get the deck to 50 with 2 cores. I do know that the decks will not be good in 4 player with just 2 cores. So what else should we get to build a good partnership in decks so we don't get destroyed off the bat. Deluxe Expansions, Saga sets, packs.\n\nWhat should I get. I have a lot of experience with CCG's and deck building in those type of games. I understand the LCG system but have never player a LCG or a cooperative game. I am use to dropping 100's even 1,000's of dollars on CCG's so 2-3 hundred dollars would not be a problem for a fun gaming experience. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251766-getting-started/?do=findComment&comment=2828974","commentId":2828974,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1496996392,"content":"A single core is absolutely fine."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251766-getting-started/?do=findComment&comment=2829014","commentId":2829014,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1497001258,"content":"Everyone who wants to get into the game should check out the \"new player buying guide\" by tales from the cards: https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/ [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/]\nIf you only want to start out with the core set one is enough for 2 players (there won't be a huge difference in power once you got some expension), for 4 I would recommend 2 cores. All quest of the core set can be won in a two player game with no extra cards, that said the last quest is pretty hard no matter what.\n\nSome personal experience so you maybe don't have to read the full linked guide (even though I would recommend it):\n- the shadow of mirkwood cycle mostly is better for his playing cards than the quests, but they aren't very hard most of the time so it's good to get into the game post-CS.\n- Khazad-Dum + Dwarrowdelf Cycle have awesome cards and good quests -> highly recommended\n-Blood of Numenor is maybe the hardest box ever released -> wait until you got (in chronological order) most of the previous stuff - the following cycle is not as mad as the box, but that doesn't make it worth i my oppinion.\n-wouldn't advice to go to later boxes, they don't feel as hard as BoN, but we had an other cycle of player cards and I'd say got used to upped difficulty.\n\nObvious but important: Don't get an adventure pack without the corresponding box or you can't play the quest and (temporarely) wasted half of the pack ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251766-getting-started/?do=findComment&comment=2829908","commentId":2829908,"userName":"DJRAZZ","timestamp":1497032425,"content":"I watch all those videos and it cleared up most of my questions.

It is not like a TCG where you can spend only a few or 50.000. Here there is a well-know number of pack existing and once you get all of them you can do whatever you want. My advice are the following:\n\n- Don't be hurry to buy the second core set. There will be no new cards, no new scenario. Every single other adventure pack ou deluxe is more exciting in my opinion;\n\n- Build your mono sphere deck. It is a cool thing that I have done during a very long time by myself. But as this is not fit very well with thematic aspect of the game you will also build two, three of even four-sphere deck after that.\n\n- Think about proxy. You're a LCG player so you know how it work: can make more powerful deck if you can duplicate cards. Even if you build mono sphere there is a few neutral cards that you might want in multiple times (Gandalf, Pelargir envoy, seeing-stone). It is even more true if you build multiple thematic deck that share sphere.\n\n- The game go better and better, especially the scenario. I don't see many people who share that opinion but I feel so bored when I play back at cycle 2 and have the feeling that everything look the same. We all enjoy them when they released because we were less experienced. But starting with cycle 3 we can see so many interesting mechanic. Train yourself with the two first cycle then you will discover a whole new game, which is hard like Calvadur says.\n\n- Don't expect too much about the saga. They are my major disappointment about this game.\n\nHave fun :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited June 10, 2017 by Rouxxor"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251766-getting-started/?do=findComment&comment=2831065","commentId":2831065,"userName":"DJRAZZ","timestamp":1497111099,"content":"> 10 hours ago, Authraw said:\n> \n> You could try picking up Heirs of Numenor (Deluxe) + The Druadan Forest (Adventure Pack).
