I'm not sure what brought it on, but this week I've really got an itch to get a regular play group together for the game, even if we just use my collection. I'm thinking after New Year's I'll put together a Learn to Play event at my FLGS on a Saturday and run anyone who is interested through A Passage Through Mirkwood and Journey Down the Anduin at least.\n\nAfter that, if there are any players interested, what would be good cycles to get and play through to start? Is there a clear order to them, storywise, or do the cycles make just as much sense in whatever order?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265472-getting-a-group-started/?do=findComment&comment=3126563","commentId":3126563,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1513314549,"content":"You'll probably grab more attention if you play the Saga quests."}]}
