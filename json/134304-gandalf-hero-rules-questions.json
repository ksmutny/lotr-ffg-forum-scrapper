The fact that the top card of your deck is treated as it was in your hand does not change this in any way. I'm writing this, because it was a little difficult for me during play to get used to it, the more difficult when there was some great attachment or ally on top of my deck and I was already after planning or I have just used G's ability during planning and the now-on-top card was just screaming \"play me!\" ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134304-gandalf-hero-rules-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1443471","commentId":1443471,"userName":"Strategian","timestamp":1423593450,"content":"Thank you for all the replies. FFG (Caleb Grace) & Tales From The Cards agreed with us.\n\nFFG:\n\n1. Gandalf’s ability allows you to play the top card of your deck as if it was from your hand, so you can pay for it like any other card you play from your hand. That means you can use resources from other heroes you control (as long as there is a resource match).\n\n2. Yes.\n\n3. Resources from Gandalf’s pool can be used to pay for neutral cards played from your hand.\n\nTales From The Cards:\n\n1. Yes, other heroes can help pay for the top card. This is because Gandalf's ability states that you can play the top card \"as if it were in your hand\", meaning that you treat it literally as if you were playing any other card in your hand, including other heroes being able to pay for it.\n\n2. Yes, for the same reasons as above.\n\nStrategian"}]}
