All my games i use to play against Dol-Guldor i never lose. I mean 2 players game. On that moment me and My friend was really sceptic about this game. Cose it was to easy. When HFG come dificulty 4 we was so disappointed so already almost want to quit play this game.\n\nI have big experience with Magic and Lotr tcg Decipher. My friend also big experience with Magic. And we feel like hey what up??? We cannot lose the most difficult quest at all???? We like the game but we need challenge!!!! Than Carrock come. OK I play and win easy solo. Than we play with my firend and We LOSE!!!!! First 2 players game for 3 months!!!!Ok next one wi win. And next one again lose!!!! With Dol-Guldor never!!!! Than we get Rhosgobel this one is quite specific.You need a certain deck for win.\n\nOsgiliath is most cool quest for now is really interesting, you never know how game can change every turn.\n\nThan come Stand and fight (errata) and i say my self: hey man they trying to make it harder so good good!!!!\n\nAnd boom Emyn Muil Difficult 4. Why??? But im happy cose not only me complain about this now.\n\nActually you should look on this one. I think is amazing. this is a fan quest but look really promising:\n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/article/7636369#7636369 [http://boardgamegeek.com/article/7636369#7636369]\n\nThis kind of product we should to get from FFG!!!!\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54594-playing-escape-from-dol-guldor-and-losing-repeatedly/?do=findComment&comment=541181","commentId":541181,"userName":"Dwnhmcntryboy","timestamp":1318446731,"content":" When you guys can beat lvl 4 quests easily with regularity then you should look at moving up the ladder to lvl 6 if you can still beat all the 4's and 6 a good ***** of the time then go to the 7's and 9 .

Beating it solo required over 30 tries for me and it requires sheer luck.\n\nWith two players we have a win percentage of slightly more than 50% - and that's using fairly unoptimized decks.
