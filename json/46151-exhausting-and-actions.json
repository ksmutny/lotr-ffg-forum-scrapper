I'm coming from the only CCG I've ever briefly played, Magic: The Gathering, and I think this was how it worked there. I just want to make sure it isn't how it works in LOTR (otherwise the game just got a whole lot easier).\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46151-exhausting-and-actions/?do=findComment&comment=462450","commentId":462450,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1304350371,"content":"No, if the character is exhausted by attacking, defending, card effect etc, you do not activate their exhaust ability.  You must choose whether to exhaust them for their ability or not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46151-exhausting-and-actions/?do=findComment&comment=462544","commentId":462544,"userName":"Mackey79","timestamp":1304364304,"content":"And it doesn't work like that for Magic neither. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46151-exhausting-and-actions/?do=findComment&comment=462552","commentId":462552,"userName":"zombipuppy","timestamp":1304367098,"content":"Thanks guys.
