We just bought this pack since we're a little late to the LotR party and hit a little rules snag with Wilyador. If Wilyador has more than 5 damage upon it and Lore of Imladris is played, can the event be resolved? Here's my reasoning:\n\n \n\nLet's say that Wilyador has 6 damage. Lore of Imladris is played, healing 6 damage from Wilyador. However, Wilyador's text states \"Wilyador cannot be healed of more than 5 wounds by a single effect\", which invalidates the Lore of Imladris thereby preventing it from being able to be played. I thought that maybe the event would just heal 5 damage off Wilyador instead, but since it states \"all\" damage, 5 would not satisfy the event's text, thereby preventing it from being able to resolve.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAm I right in my line of thinking, or can the event just be used to heal 5 damage? Thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231183-wilyador-lore-of-imladris/?do=findComment&comment=2436238","commentId":2436238,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1475171247,"content":"My guess would be that Wilyador is supposed to heal 5 from Lore of Imladris, but at the same time your logic is sound and if I were playing a game with someone who made that argument I would be inclined to accept their idea."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231183-wilyador-lore-of-imladris/?do=findComment&comment=2436390","commentId":2436390,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1475176041,"content":"I'm not completely certain -- I will never remember the distinctions between \"all\" and \"each\" and whatever in this game -- but I would think the partial fulfillment ruling would apply here:\n\nhttps://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219926-partially-fulfilling-card-effects/#entry2238006 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219926-partially-fulfilling-card-effects/#entry2238006]\n\ni.e., you can heal 5."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231183-wilyador-lore-of-imladris/?do=findComment&comment=2436463","commentId":2436463,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1475178128,"content":"Google search found plenty who play it as healing for five, none who thought it wouldn't work it all.  For example, in Beorn's Path:\n\n \n\nhttps://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/beorns-path-part-10-a-journey-to-rhosgobel/ [https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/beorns-path-part-10-a-journey-to-rhosgobel/]\n\n \n\n\"With Wilyador limited to being healed five damage from each Athelas or Lore of Imaldris...\"\n\n \n\nNote that the Athelas objective doesn't specify any particular level of healing, it's stage 3B that makes it 5 each.  The player card Athelas heals \"all damage on a character\", so I presume the Athelas objective would be capable of the same thing, were it not for the scenario-imposed limit."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231183-wilyador-lore-of-imladris/?do=findComment&comment=2441154","commentId":2441154,"userName":"FrogTrigger","timestamp":1475518717,"content":"I thought of this last night as well as I was playing this scenario but just ruled that it must be the 5 damage.
