The Chuck Norris Exhaust to Win Award (best player card): Ranger Spikes.  Pretty much cancels an enemy, buffs Faramir, and can be recycled with Anborn.  Spear of the Citadel comes in 2nd.\n\n2. The Fatty: When He Exhausts, Discard Him Award (worst  player card): Children of the Sea.  I can't see ever including that in a deck.  Pippin is pretty high up there, but a spirit Hobbit has value regardless of abilities.\n\n3. Angry Bear Swings Twice Award (most thematic player card): Palantir.  I try really hard to include it in my decks if at all feasible.  Small Target is close behind.\n\n4. Haldir is a Boy Award (best player card art): Tough call between a lot of good heroes.  I think I'm actually going to go with Mirlonde over Boromir, Faramir, and Beregond.\n\n5. Boromir Ringbearer Award (most overpowered player card): So many Outlands cards to choose from... but it has to go to Visionary Leadership.\n\n6. Bill the Pony Award (card that seems innocent, but is very powerful): Silvan Refugee can be really nice in a solo game.\n\n7. Hail of Apples Award (cool but useless player card): Against the Shadow.  A cool idea, but it just isn't that effective.  Forest Patrol would be my next vote.\n\n8. It’s a B+ (not the best player card, but you’ll use it a lot): Faramir.  He's really not that strong of a hero, but I just love playing with him.  I was once able to one-shot a Hill Troll with him, which was worth the price of admission.\n\n9. Gimli and Legolas Superfriends Award (best co-op player card): Visionary Leadership.  If by best, you mean strongest.  I'll add that I think Mutual Accord will have value as Voice of Isengard gets developed.\n\n10. Tom Bombadil is the Witch King Award (most controversial player card): I'll just go with Forlong, to symbolize the whole Outlands trait.\n\nEdited November 19, 2013 by Teamjimby"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93784-heirs-of-numenoragainst-the-shadow-player-card-awards/?do=findComment&comment=912629","commentId":912629,"userName":"Glowwyrm","timestamp":1384907251,"content":"Thanks for the reply, Teamjimby!  And for the analysis!\n\nMy own votes:\n\nGeneral:\n1.

A Good Harvest: before the clarification in the FAQ, it seemed like a way to splash another sphere into a deck without songs.  but since you have to have resource match, it is a mediocre card that smooths resources for a turn.

The Chuck Norris Exhaust to Win Award (best player card) - Knight of Minas Tirith - Not only is this guy awesome looking, but when Leadership Boromir is active, he attacks for 4!  There may be other, more powerful cards in this cycle but he is my favorite. \n 2.  The Fatty: When He Exhausts, Discard Him Award (worst  player card) - Palantir - Seems like it is a highly conditional card to use.  I don't mind scrying, but this is too chancy for me to ever use.  Runner up to weakest card goes to Ranger Bow.. though the artwork is amazing, I think it's a pretty lame effect, exhausting a character and the bow just for one damage.\n 3.  Angry Bear Swings Twice Award (most thematic player card) - Gaining Strength.  Love the artwork of Aragorn challenging Sauron and letting him know he is coming to take him out.  Cool effect too. \n 4.  Haldir is a Boy Award (best player card art) - Boromir and Faramir hero cards - it's a tie! \n 5.  Boromir Ringbearer Award (most overpowered player card) - Can't really pick a single overpowered card, but obviously Outland decks can get crazy strong. \n 6.  Bill the Pony Award (card that seems innocent, but is very powerful) - Squire of the Citadel seems like it fits this category, he is innocent looking and ultimately serves as front-line fodder, but even then he gives a nice dying tribute to Boromir when an orc slashes him down!\n 7.  Hail of Apples Award (cool but useless player card) - Well Equipped.  I loved the fact that FFG decided to throw in a random Dwarf card for this cycle, but it is a bit useless compared to others. (Especially Bofur's awesome ability)  Yet, the artwork is nice.\n 8.  It’s a B+ (not the best player card, but you’ll use it a lot) - Gondorian Discipline.  It really is a weaker card, but I do find myself using it in my Gondor-heavy decks.  It's nice to instantly heal 2 damage and the fact that it is from Tactics is interesting.  \n 9.  Gimli and Legolas Superfriends Award (best co-op player card) - Errand-rider.  Very nice ally that lets you lend a resource to anyone in need. \n 10. Tom Bombadil is the Witch King Award (most controversial player card) - No one card, really - but again, Outlands can definitely get crazy near the end of a quest!\n\nEdited November 20, 2013 by Karlson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93784-heirs-of-numenoragainst-the-shadow-player-card-awards/?do=findComment&comment=912786","commentId":912786,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1384923851,"content":"Great idea, thanks for posting!  Here is my feedback:\n\n \n\nBest sphere cards - Tactics.  The Hammer-stroke and Trained for War open up some cool options.\n\n \n\nShort stick - Leadership -- I think all the spheres got wonderful cards.  I see myself using the Leadership cards the least, though.  So my vote is based on taste rather than raw card power...\n\nArchetype - Rangers.  Hobbits are a super close second though.  If Black Riders were a part of this I would have to go with Hobbits.  Without the BR cards in consideration, it is hard to build an effective Hobbit deck, but the ones that I *did* build before BR hit shelves were really tricksy and fun to play.\n\nMono-spheres? - No, didn't really dig it.  For me, it just produced a bunch of new cards that only work in one type of deck.  I prefer diversity of purpose.\n\n \n\nAwards:\n\n 1.

(card that seems innocent, but is very powerful) Mighty Prowess.  Really effective card in certain quests.  This card cuts swaths through enemy gangs in any Moria quest, the Hobbit sagas, Blood of Gondor...

(cool but useless player card) Pippin.  He would have so much potential if the text simply read \"cannot engage *anyone*\"\n 8.  (not the best player card, but you’ll use it a lot): A Watchful Peace.  Great tool for Spirit to stem the flow of enemies, or to deliver up a predictable shadow effect, especially since Spirit generally lacks combat prowess.\n 9.

Tactics. The assumption is that this cycle would make Tactics more relevant, and it didn't disappoint.\n\nWhat sphere got the short stick? Lore. Yeah, it got Ranger Spikes. That's pretty much it. The Ranger deck is meant to be played mono-Lore, and the one card that it needed to help with resources, Master of Lore, got hit with the most controversial errata in the game.\n\nWhat was the best deck archetype to come out of this cycle? I am taking this as most powerful archetype, so Outlands takes the cake there.\n\nDid you like the focus on mono-sphere decks? No. I think FFG added some interesting cards, but obviously the focus was on Outlands, a trait. Before that, it was the Dwarves. Before that, it was Rohan and Eagles. In the Black Riders, it was Hobbits. As much as I appreciate FFG giving us different options for deckbuilding, the synergies from the beginning have been built around traits, not spheres.\n\nAwards:\n\n1.The Chuck Norris Exhaust to Win Award (best player card): Right now, it is Ranger Spikes. When Voice of Isengard comes out, Mutual Accord. There is going to be a ridiculous amount of synergy going on there.\n\n2.The Fatty: When He Exhausts, Discard Him Award (worst player card): Gondorian Lampwright. The only redeeming quality is that he can chump block. Pretty useless ability. Why not just cancel the surge outright?\n\n3.Angry Bear Swings Twice Award (most thematic player card): Palantir.\n\n4.Haldir is a Boy Award (best player card art): The Hammer-stroke.\n\n5.Boromir Ringbearer Award (most overpowered player card): Forlong. This card should cost 6.\n\n6.Bill the Pony Award (card that seems innocent, but is very powerful): Caldara/Emery. Okay, I am cheating here, but hear me out. You get a free ally that indirectly feeds the ability of a hero that everyone has overlooked. Couple these two cards with Hidden Cache and Zigil/Stargazer, and you have a pretty potent deck that can flood the table with allies fairly quickly.\n\n7.Hail of Apples Award (cool but useless player card): Faramir. Too high threat, wasted stats, but an iconic character with great art.\n\n8.It’s a B+ (not the best player card, but you’ll use it a lot): Silvan Refugee. 1 cost, 2 WP ally. I think that is a huge bargain, especially if she can stick around for a couple of rounds.\n\n9.Gimli and Legolas Superfriends Award (best co-op player card): The Hammer-stroke. This is the ultimate bail-out card for this cycle. Your support deck gets swamped by a Mumak, Morgul Spider, Lieutenant of Mordor, etc. This card with Thicket of Spears is money.\n\n10.Tom Bombadil is the Witch King Award (most controversial player card): Théoden.

The Mono-Leadership Gondor deck.  It builds itself, buffs allies, and can make a ton of resources with the ability to give them away to other players very easily.\n\nDid you like the focus on mono-sphere decks? Yes, it's easy to play pick-up games with multiple people - assign spheres and there is no risk of conflicts with unique heroes.\n\nAwards:\n\n 1.

Angry Bear Swings Twice Award (most thematic player card) - The Records, probably the Book of Eldacar.  It's cool to think that a hero is rummaging through this old battlefield manual to learn the secrets of a Quick Strike, or how to call more Eagles into action (The Eagles are coming), etc\n 4.  Haldir is a Boy Award (best player card art) - Trained for War.  There is so much story wrapped up in that card.  Boromir and Faramir practicing while Denethor watches form the Shadows.  Boromir, the outwardly stronger and brasher brother, is besting Faramir, etc.\n 5.  Boromir Ringbearer Award (most overpowered player card) - Mithrandir's Advice, I love this card but it is disgusting how quickly a mono-lore deck can churn through a 50-card deck with this card\n 6.

At first it seems a little blah or useless, but I think already people are figuring out just what his can do for you.\n 7.  Hail of Apples Award (cool but useless player card) Ithilien Pit.

And I feel Caleb & Co. want the same, so please, these were a mistake - every one does them but it is nice to do something about them when it happens. That said, the Herdsman and Men of the West together with Lord of Morthond are the cards that make them almost invincibly bad.\n\n \n\nPalantír is really a great thematic card.\n\n \n\nDenethor is controversial. Very poor in comparison to Faramir (ally). If there's no direct damage to heroes (aka Necromancer's Reach or Blocking Wargs) then he is still good.

Emery is a great ally, Gondorian Shield is superb, and Palantir is very thematic, although I don't use it very often.\n\n \n\n \n\n1.
