Khamul is only named in the UT book. This would lead to suggest yes. They could also just bought Khamûl, and not a whole license.\n\nWhy FFG should get a license if they don't have one yet:\n\nThe Blue Wizards are named in UT in the essay on the Istari. Also in the Silmarillion, but I doubt anyone ever getting a license for the S. Many people including me would love to see them represented in the game.\n\nThe Battles of the Fords of the Isen are in UT. As suggested in another thread: good expansion material.\n\nA lot of information about the Palantíri is in UT. Some people have been dieing for a 'better' palantir/ not a general palantir card but unique ones.\n\nBut the best thing I will quote:\n\n''For with the consent of Eru they sent members of their own high order [...]. Of this Order the number is UNKNOWN; but of those that came to the North of Middle-earth,[...], the chiefs were five.\n\nThis suggested that their are more Istari in our 'playregion'. (FFG invented Istari!) :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nTo come back to my question:\n\nDoes anybody know if FFF has a license or how to find out?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182627-unfinished-tales-license/?do=findComment&comment=1694220","commentId":1694220,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1437061992,"content":"As I understand it, the rights for The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are owned by Saul Zaentz.  Everything else is owned by the Tolkein estate.  (Read: Christopher Tolkein)  We would have never had the movies and maybe not even the games if Christopher Tolkein had his say."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182627-unfinished-tales-license/?do=findComment&comment=1694252","commentId":1694252,"userName":"timbolton","timestamp":1437064378,"content":"Anything brought out after Tolkien's death (ie by Christopher Tolkien) has never been licensed for gaming or other purposes.\n\nLOTR and Hobbit rights for films and associated merchandise are owned by SZ, and there is a thin line they have to be careful of crossing in producing stuff.

I don't think FFG have the rights to Unfinished Tales as the Tolkien estate has been clear about not licensing out anything they control (everything except Hobbit/LOTR), especially once Jackson and the movies came out. However, before the movies, the Middle Earth CCG did use the Blue Wizards with special permission from the estate (this is specified in the copyright information for that game). So it is possible that such special permission for certain characters could be obtained again, but the pre-movie estate was probably more permissive than the post-movie estate, since Christopher Tolkien really started speaking out against licensing and merchandising in reaction to Jackson's films.\n\n \n\nAnyway, the Khamul case is an aberration, I think. Games Workshop also used Khamul in their Lord of the Rings game. But I'm not sure what the deal is with either."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182627-unfinished-tales-license/?do=findComment&comment=1694266","commentId":1694266,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1437064881,"content":"To clarify my point, I'm referring to the following cards, and while technically the wizards aren't depicted in the pictures (they represented them with the moth Gandalf uses to call the eagles in the movies), it's the names that count.

It doed not only form a means to get around license-stuff but I was struck (not the first time) by the open endings and the possibilities for further stories. Man, those moments make me sad but lets my imagination run free.\n\nKhamul seems indeed to be the odd-one-out, SBG uses him, we use him. Maybe the Estate lets him pass, or whatever.\n\nIt's indeed sad, as said above, that one mam holds such power. Of course, it's the work of his dad, but by publishing the works it became universal work. He ain't the author, merely the translator. Not that I blaim Christopher, though he seems narrowminded/shortsighted. I don't think the movies are bad.

The first movie (fellowship) was pretty solid, but even in that movie you had the stupid scene at the going away party of fireworks hitting a hobbit in the butt or whatever. I mean I just don't want to see stuff like far jokes in LOTR, and there was a lot of that. Any dialogue not based on Tolkien was laughably poor. One of my favorite episodes in the entire series is when Frodo falls into a coma and Sam ends up severely wounding Shelob when she tries to crush him. There are so many amazing g images and ideas in that section, all about the nature of good and evil and weakness and strength. The movie just basterdizes it by turning Sam into Rambo and the sequence on film is utterly forgettable and generic. That is just a taste of why the movies sucked.
