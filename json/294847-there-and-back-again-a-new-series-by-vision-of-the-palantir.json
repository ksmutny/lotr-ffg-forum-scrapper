This new series of his will be called There and Back Again, and will be a true solo Progression series. But not just any progression series, this one will make slight tweeks to the card to balance them for solo players, and will try to stay as thematic as possible, ergo: no Eagles in Moria. Read all about this introduction to the series here: https://visionofthepalantir.com/2019/05/02/introduction-to-the-there-and-back-again-series/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2019/05/02/introduction-to-the-there-and-back-again-series/]\n\nThe entire series will be posted at a regular interval on Vision of the Palantir and can be found here: https://visionofthepalantir.com/other/there-and-back-again/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/other/there-and-back-again/]\n\nHopefully, this will allow me to keep up the stream of content for the coming 5 months, as I will be busy graduating. In the mean time, I will also like to mention that the final date for becoming eligible for exclusive VotP loot will be August 31st. If you are subscribed to the Patreon page [https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7631819] by then, you will have some awesome loot heading your way in October. I will be attending Con of the Rings 2019, so I can hand it to you in person. If you cannot attend, then I will mail it to you, but additional shipping costs may apply. We have recently crossed the $50 mark, so we are very close to meeting the next goal, at which I will be releasing the second strategy guide for cycles 3&4 to the public. Patreon subscribers get early access to this document, which is being worked on as we speak.\n\nThat about covers it. Please check out the new series, I will keep this thread updated with the new articles that are released (hopefully as soon as next week).\n\nDurins_Father"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294847-there-and-back-again-a-new-series-by-vision-of-the-palantir/?do=findComment&comment=3695159","commentId":3695159,"userName":"Crusaderlord","timestamp":1556875324,"content":"Thank you, as a solo player i will definitely be following your blog and am interested in seeing your solo rule tweaks. I really enjoy your site so thank you...\n\nMy own take on how i enjoy solo play :\n\nI do have two core sets and do not limit myself so i can use two copies of the relevant cards, for example unexpected courage, although it is so rare that i ever get both in play in one game it seems, but it does increases the odds of it appearing.  I always use a 50 card support deck.\n\nI use all the encounter cards, removing some always feels a little bit of a game limiting option and could lose the real flavour of the quest.\n\nI always start with an extra resource, which to me has always been the best balancing item enabling you to get a card or two in play as a single player early on. So i use a semi-easy mode in reality.\n\nI am not very knowledgeable on the books, but i would tend to limit thematically to some extent for instance no mounts included on the ships or eagles underground, as these just do not make sense to me.\n\nI have dabbled with using rules for ranged and sentinel - mainly : exhaust a ranged character to deal one damage to an enemy in the staging area / sentinel exhaust to add their defense to another defender. However of late i have dropped these rules again and tend not to miss then overly much.\n\nTweak a quest card rule. This is rare but some  harder quests are clearly written with only multiplayer in mind, for instance an example is some 'first player' triggers which would unfairly impact a solo game every round whereas there is a clear inference to spread the pain across players. So in some cases i may reduce the trigger to every other round to compensate for the fact that i should have passed the first player token on. I only do this for the most difficult quests and where i see a clear relationship between the trigger and player count. The witch king attack effect in battle of pelennor fields is an example of this. Conversely i have also been known to add an additional encounter trigger such as 'search for an enemy and add to staging', when a quest is too easy with my current deck to make them more difficult. Sometimes this is easier than starting to limit what you can include in your deck and trying to remember which cards were issued with which set.\n\n In the end i have no issues about players making the game play out solo in a way that works for them. It is the best solo game i own by far > http://crusadersgames.co.uk/board-games/lord-of-the-rings-lcg [http://crusadersgames.co.uk/board-games/lord-of-the-rings-lcg/]/\n\n   \n\n \n\nEdited May 3, 2019 by Crusaderlord"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294847-there-and-back-again-a-new-series-by-vision-of-the-palantir/?do=findComment&comment=3695409","commentId":3695409,"userName":"dragoncymru","timestamp":1556899584,"content":"Really hope everyone enjoys what I've written and I hope to keep up a regular stream of content.\n\nThe next article due next week will discuss my take on solo play - Story mode as I call it - and the rules I use.\n\nFeedback and comments always welcome!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294847-there-and-back-again-a-new-series-by-vision-of-the-palantir/?do=findComment&comment=3695637","commentId":3695637,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1556912576,"content":"Looking forward to it!
