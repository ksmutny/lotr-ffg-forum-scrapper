They fix a good set of card in each box, also they fix nice and neat in the FFG Core set box, leaving a bit of room to allow manuals and other junk to sit on top. They also are wide enough to fit sleeved cards nicely.\n\nA tuck box, is just a pattern you print out, fold, glue and then you have a nice looking box to place your cards in.\n\nThere is a box for Lore, Spirit, Leadership and Tactics, as well as one for Neutral and Heroes. Simply download the JPGs or the PDFs and print and fold.\n\nDue to the size of the boxes you need to print on A4 with out any boarders or resizing, so make sure the printer you take it to can \"print to the edge\". If not, you will need to print on A3.\n\nI hope you like, please comment if you do!\n\nThe BBG file thread is here\nwww.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/71778/lotrlcg-tuckboxes-heroes-lore-leadership-neutr [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/71778/lotrlcg-tuckboxes-heroes-lore-leadership-neutr]\n\n \n\nExample - These are basicly what they look like, though the Netural, and Heroes are not here, and also the Leadership one has changed.

Basically it is made to fit tightly into the original game box. I used packing tape to hold the sections together (look closely at the corners and you can see it). Outside of the box it is flimsy, but inside the box it is kept sturdy by the actual box. The middle sections are not rock solid but they won't fall over or break.\n\nFirst step is to take 4 pieces of cardboard (the sturdiest you can find) and make a square that fits just inside the original box (try and make it a fairly tight fit). Use the tape to hold the corners together. From there determine what size and shape sections you want, and cut the cardboard into the necessary sections. Use tape at every possible corner (on both sides) to attach all the pieces together. Once you are done you'll have a square of cardboard with sections (no bottom) that is a little flimsy. Just take that and put it in the game box and it should fit snugly. The snug fit will make it fairly sturdy since it will be pushing up against the sides of the box and won't flop around.\n\nI love it. It fits what I wanted to do perfectly, and I can carry around a lot of cards in the original game box, along with all the various tokens and threat counters."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57499-card-storage-and-organization/?do=findComment&comment=582754","commentId":582754,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1327151903,"content":"I have been playing with Svenn's method for storing cards, and this is my WIP for Call of Cthuluhu, It is almost finished apart form 2 dividers on the edge there.

It puts all my cards in one spot in a easy to store boxes, and as I have my original Boxes everything is cool.\n\nI'm going to be changing to this method for my LoTR collection. There is one other thing.... A real good way to store your dividers for this method is to take your AP box, unfold it, then cut off all the \"tabs\" apart form 1. So you end up with the front of the AP box, (with teh name and GFX) and 1 side of the AP box. This creates a card, with a wrap around side that can slot into the cards as a divider, but is readable as the side of the PA box is flat on the cards...\n\n \n\n7394558.jpg [http://www5.picturepush.com/photo/a/7394558/640/7394558.jpg]\n\n \n\n \n\nThe small cardboard bits in the APs work great to divide the factions as well...

I print card size descriptive inserts to use as dividers or headers for each section. The larger end section is used for the tokens and threat counters etc. With the release of the next cycle I will be adding a second box. I do this with my other games - I have 2 boxes for WI and 3 boxes for AGoT."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57499-card-storage-and-organization/?do=findComment&comment=598452","commentId":598452,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1330097319,"content":"Avalanche said:\n\nI really liked the blue insert that came with the core set but it only had one row and it ran out of room so my wife just flipped the insert  inside out, and taped the edges together forming it into a box with two rows.  I have everything released and there's still a good amount of room and I got to keep the blue insert look.  \n\n\n\nA couple people have mentioned this method and it's what I chose to do as well. I just wanted to add that I use the cardboard pieces from inside the APs as dividers. I just trim them to fit in the lanes and then slide them between encounter decks and the different spheres of player cards. Unfortunately there aren't enough to separate each encounter group from the core set -- those just get lumped as a single stack. I like this method because it fits sleeved cards nicely."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57499-card-storage-and-organization/?do=findComment&comment=598480","commentId":598480,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1330101835,"content":"ichaos1985 said:\n\nRince said:\n\n \n\nRince said:\n\n \n\nI use a Magic the Gathering Fat Pack box to store my cards.\n\n \n\n \n\nlotr_box_01.jpg [https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CAhXPbqtmoI/TyOtb87KZPI/AAAAAAAACPs/BOYodVaFVH4/s640/lotr_box_01.jpg]\n\n \n\nlotr_box_02.jpg [https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H3cHnrTnpH8/TyOtb89EM5I/AAAAAAAACPo/wsknKtEXicY/s640/lotr_box_02.jpg]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNice!
