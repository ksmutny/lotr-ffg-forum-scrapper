This week’s tournament takes the next step in a series of tournaments exploring the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].\n\nWill you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].\n\nAnd now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!\n\nSolo Player Tournament #5:\n\nQuest: Journey to Rhosgobel\nDeck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + HfG, CotC, & JtR Adventure Packs\nNumber of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck\n\nTop Ten:\n\n1. wraith428 ~ 23 (Thodred, Bilbo, Éowyn)\n2.

Have to say that I don't like Rhosgobel as it feels like a lottery. SO here is my first result:\n\n \n\nHeroes: Glóin, Beravor, Bilbo\n\nHeroes Threat: 24\n\nHeroes Damage: 0\n\nRounds: 60\n\nVictory Points: 4\n\nResult: 80\n\n \n\nEncounters were:\n\n1. Dol Guldur Beast Master (never engaged him)\n\n2. Driven by Shadow\n\n3. Black Forest Bats (engaged and killed in round 4)\n\n4. Forest Grove (scenario action, travelled to next round) / Caught in a Net\n\n5. Black Forest Bats (scenario action, killed the same round) / Mirkwood Flock / Great Forest Web (guarded Athelas, travelled to next round)\n\n6. Mirkwood Flock\n\n7. Forest Grove\n\n \n\nPlayed Henamarth in round 1 and Radagast in round 2, possibly the most powerful 6 resource combo early in the game. Radagast could collect 5 resources until round 7 which he then spent to heal Wilyador. I drew 2 Lore of Imladris during the game which healed Wilyador for another 10 points. PoL in round 3 supported me with enough questing power, and a Silverlode Archer in round 4 defeated the 2 Black Forest Bats. It was perhaps a mistake to play the archer, as I could have used these resources to play Gandalf in my last round, but I wanted to avoid possible nasty shadow card effects by the bats (still had to assign 4 points damage to Wilyador thanks to Festering Wounds and Swarming Insects). Managed to Sneak Gandalf twice in the quest phase and used him to lower my threat my 10 points. Bilbo got caught in a net, fortunatly he wasn't exhausted at that point. Used him to grab the Athelas in round 6."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573400","commentId":573400,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1325428676,"content":"Ok, and now for real:\n\nI built a deck that was not designed for defeating the deck as often as possible, but to specifically reach a superb score.\n\nHeroes: Glorfindel, Éowyn, Frodo\nHeroes Threat: 24\nHeroes Damage: 2\nRounds: 20\nVictory Points: 4\nResult: 42\n\nIt wasn't especially hard to get this result, and those who have multiple cores will have it even more easy.

King Spider\n\nI think the experts will know what happened, so I have fun to figure it out. My fear is that as it's not that difficult to get to this result (the only tricky thing is to grab an Athelas in time) this tournament will become rather dull. Didn't have Steward of Gondor btw, so two additional Sneak/Gandalf should be possible to get it down to 30 points (without the hero damage).\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573402","commentId":573402,"userName":"Da_Engineer","timestamp":1325429285,"content":"This is going to be a boring tourny lol.\n\nHeroes: Denethor, Éowyn, Frodo\nHeroes Threat: 25\nHeroes Damage: 0\nRounds: 10\nVictory Points: 4\nResult: 31\n\nEncounters:\n\nAthelas Guarded: Evil Storm\n\nBlack Forest Bats\n\nAs lepotokurt stated, I will not say how this was done because it was too easy and all I needed was the right encounters and a couple of cards (even then there are many encounters that work).  I actually have a way to get a score around 10 I think but I think it needs to be too lucky to actually work, I tried it a few times and failed so I ended up posting this one as my best score but will try beating it.

Cause in that case it might be that your result is invalid, but I am not sure myself, to be honest. I will ask the board experts in another thread. As long as Rhosgobel is in the staging area, you cannot heal Wilyador. And I think this also means healing Wilyador with Athelas in stage 3B:\n\n \n\nOh, and don't forget that Athelas is guarded, so there should have been dealt a guarding encounter card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573414","commentId":573414,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1325431240,"content":"i would say you CANNOT heal if rhosgobel is in the staging area no matter what round"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573453","commentId":573453,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1325438014,"content":" I know I can lower this, but here's a score to start out with: damage 1; threat 35; vvictory points 4 (Rhosgobel); 6 rounds; score---92.  Heroes glorfindel, eowyn, theodred."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573454","commentId":573454,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1325438054,"content":"@ Engineer: Just realized that Evil Storm is not part of this encounter set.

So this leaves 2 resources. So it wash´t the Escort as there would´t have been enough resources for 2 other cards. So it must have been the PoL. But that leaves only one resource to play two cards. And although I now one 0 cost card which would be good, it makes no sense at that point.\n\nHm interesting. For turn one you had to discard one card to eowyn to get the 11 willpower needed. Then you play one Song, Lore of Imladris, heal one wound and play PoL..........this leaves you with one resource to spent and 4 cards to discard for PoL. So how did you get the 17 willpower?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573882","commentId":573882,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1325526960,"content":"Da_Engineer said:\n\nmuemakan said:\n\n \n\n \n\nInteresting, so you did not play a lore of imladris and you did not have an athelas.
