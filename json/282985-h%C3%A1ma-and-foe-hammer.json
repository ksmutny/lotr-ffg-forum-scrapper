But, at the point at which you trigger Foe-hammer, the opportunity to use Hama's ability is past.\n\nIf you make a second attack (after readying Hama, perhaps with a Rohan Warhorse), at the moment you declare your attack, you may return Foe-hammer to your hand, discarding another card. Then, if you destroy the enemy, you can trigger Foe-hammer again.\n\nSo, if you have Foe-hammer in-hand at the start of an attack, you cannot use it and return it to your hand as a part of that attack.\n\nIf you have Foe-hammer in the discard pile at the start of an attack, you can return it to hand and then use it in response to the attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282985-h%C3%A1ma-and-foe-hammer/?do=findComment&comment=3476453","commentId":3476453,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1537385408,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Onidsen said:\n> \n> If you have Foe-hammer in the discard pile at the start of an attack, you can return it to hand and then use it in response to the attack.\n\nWhat I was trying to say.\n\n> 1 hour ago, Onidsen said:\n> \n> So, if you have Foe-hammer in-hand at the start of an attack, you cannot use it and return it to your hand as a part of that attack.﻿\n\nWhat I hope didn't sound like what I was saying."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282985-h%C3%A1ma-and-foe-hammer/?do=findComment&comment=3476460","commentId":3476460,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1537385772,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Rouxxor said:\n> \n> But﻿ you can't have it back in hand on hand at the end of the combat, that is Halberto point, I think.\n\nCorrect. \n\n \n\n "}]}
