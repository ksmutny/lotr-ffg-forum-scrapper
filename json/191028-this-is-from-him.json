People from almost every LCG have gotten involved or posted (our very own alexbobspoons and Eu8L1ch are on there!) in the thread and it has blown up big time:\n\nhttp://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/28384-us-nationals-video-shows-winning-eldorath-player-repeatedly-drew-3-cards-in-the-hq-phases-of-finals-and-semi-finals/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/28384-us-nationals-video-shows-winning-eldorath-player-repeatedly-drew-3-cards-in-the-hq-phases-of-finals-and-semi-finals/]\n\n \n\nEssentially someone got caught cheating BIG TIME at the US nationals for Warhammer Conquest. Yet another reason that our glorious co-operative game is better than all the competitive ones! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] \nI feel the worst for FFG more than anyone as this will essentially sully that game for a long time and will not be forgotten by its players any time soon. Yes many people got cheated out of their victories and were eliminated from a tournament when they should not have been but as many have pointed out it had no monetary reward. Yes prizes and glory are important and I do feel awful for those who were cheated at this event but ultimately the community for that game as a whole and FFG suffer the most from this. So glad the guy got caught and honestly I am with all the rest who think he should get as punishing a verdict as possible, life time ban from the game on a competitive level and any game store or group that doesn't want to include him in their events should have every right to exclude him. Man I thought we had some controversy from time to time! So glad I never took magic to a competitive level and stumbled across the amazing co-op/solo game that is LOTR LCG instead!\n\nEdited October 12, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191028-this-is-from-him/?do=findComment&comment=1844458","commentId":1844458,"userName":"soullos","timestamp":1444633332,"content":"Wow, the way he drew the cards should be called into question as well, in addition to how many he drew.

Have fun, and enjoy the ride.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Thanks for sharing the link, PsychoRocka\n\n \n\nThere are some really interesting psychology studies about cheating (click here for an awesome and short example [http://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&t=1&islist=false&id=322538137&m=323702646]) and personality is just one factor. There are many situations in which almost anyone would cheat or lie a little, and others in which most people will not.\n\n \n\nSome people have the perspective that cheating is a natural part of gaming, and others are going to do it to you, so doing it back just levels the playing field a bit. There are all sorts of perspectives that can justify it in someone's mind. Some people just enjoy the thrill of it. Maybe for some people winning is so important to them (perhaps it would be too painful to spend many hours practicing and still not do well; the implication perhaps being that you're just not a very good player) that they are able to cheat a little bit, rationalize it by assuming that everyone does it, and walk away still feeling really good about themselves. \n\n \n\nIf a person felt bad enough when they cheat, then they wouldn't do it. So, obviously cheating doesn't bother this person very much; we don't know exactly why, and can only speculate. It doesn't make them a horrible person, but they also need to understand that the rest of us don't want them at events and that it is reasonable to request that they be banned.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191028-this-is-from-him/?do=findComment&comment=1845985","commentId":1845985,"userName":"klaymen_sk","timestamp":1444723181,"content":"I have read that thread earlier today.
