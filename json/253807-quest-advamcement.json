We were on quest 2B [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/The-Burglar%27s-Turn-THOtD] with Smaug the Golden [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Smaug-the-Golden-THOtD] in the staging area. During the quest phase, we revealed Pretending to Sleep [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Pretending-to-Sleep-THOtD], which added the 6th progress token on Smaug the Golden [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Smaug-the-Golden-THOtD]. As per the rules, we advanced to stage 4A [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Thieves-Fire-Murder-THOtD], which removes Smaug the Golden from the game and adds Smaug the Magnificent [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Smaug-the-Magnificent-THOtD] to the staging area. Since the rules state that the round sequence does not interrupt when you advance the quest, we finished resolving the quest phase. Since Smaug the Magnificent, in our case, contributed far less threat (only 6) than Smaug the Golden ( 1 threat for each character committed to the quest), we had enough progress on quest 4B as to complete it; removing Smaug the Magnificent, adding back Samug the Golden and advancing back again to quest 2B. That felt very silly.\n\nIt is how it is intended to be played?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253807-quest-advamcement/?do=findComment&comment=2873287","commentId":2873287,"userName":"Emilius","timestamp":1499663039,"content":"Read this\n\nhope it help you ;-)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253807-quest-advamcement/?do=findComment&comment=2873292","commentId":2873292,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1499663569,"content":"Thanks, it seems then that we played it correctly.\n\nA bit of a silly situation then."}]}
