None of the other quest cards have a difference like this. Curious if this is something that will be utilized in future quests or if it's just a misprint. Anyone else have this?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45932-eye-vs-broken-eye-quest-cards/?do=findComment&comment=460604","commentId":460604,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1304004055,"content":"That would be a print quality issue as the list of encounter deck cards that FFG posted today has only the one Sauron's Eye."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45932-eye-vs-broken-eye-quest-cards/?do=findComment&comment=460605","commentId":460605,"userName":"Apophenia","timestamp":1304004107,"content":" It is one of the mysteries of Middle Earth, something that will never be uncovered by mortal men.
