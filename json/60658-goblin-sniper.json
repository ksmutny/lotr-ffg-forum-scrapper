Yes they are both stuck there until 48 threat. Use Dunhere to attack them or Gandalf, Descendant, Beekeeper/Orc Slayer+Thalin, in fighting... etc etc ... many many ways to deal with these guys so build your deck accordingly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60658-goblin-sniper/?do=findComment&comment=596055","commentId":596055,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1329657519,"content":"Yes.\n\nThere are a good lot of cards that can still solve your problem, though. hehe "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60658-goblin-sniper/?do=findComment&comment=596056","commentId":596056,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1329657756,"content":" Yeah, that's a bad situation, but you should generally at least have Gandalf in your deck.\n\nAlso, you can use Daughter of Nimrodel or Self Preservation to cancel out that damage very turn.\n\n(Heck, Gloin + Self Preservation + two snipers is a nice way to get an extra two resources every round lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif])"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60658-goblin-sniper/?do=findComment&comment=596061","commentId":596061,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1329658519,"content":"gatharion said:\n\n(Heck, Gloin + Self Preservation + two snipers is a nice way to get an extra two resources every round\n\nThese kind of ideas are great, turning a encounter card into a boon for you is such a good way to build a deck. I remember back in the 1st APs, i forget witch now... but there was a discard attachment treachery and Tragic made a great deck that used this effect as a major strategy to move steward of gondor around his heroes. Allowing a early (no steward) mid (steward) and late game (steward on new hero). It was pretty cool.\n\nThis Golin thing is a great resource engine that is basically for free, one of the best solutions to snipers I have read."}]}
