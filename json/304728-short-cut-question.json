Then, reveal 1 card from the encounter deck and add it to the staging area.\"\n\nIt's meant that Short Cut can cancel the potential \"when revealed\" effect of revealed location? The phrase is confusing, because after a location enters play can mean after you reveal a location = after triggering \"when revealed\" effect.\n\nIt's quite important difference, because by Short Cut you can avoid some nasty \"when revealed\" effects of locations. Without such possibility Short Cut wouldn't be too useful.\n\nThanks and glory to LOTR LCG!\n\nSilblade"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304728-short-cut-question/?do=findComment&comment=3875359","commentId":3875359,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1579530201,"content":"A When Revealed effect will fire before Short Cut does.\n\nThis can be seen by either looking at the RR entry for Staging [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule598] and extrapolating a bit—entering play occurring at step #3—or trusting @Seastan [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/240509-seastan/]'s work in his (unofficial but well-researched) reveal guide:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/18Z-F6r0f2aIlEF8QTuVgHuGQYKsObkxyGwwM4_W978Y/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Z-F6r0f2aIlEF8QTuVgHuGQYKsObkxyGwwM4_W978Y/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nEDIT: Also, there is a FAQ about the timing of an enemy's When Revealed that easily extends to locations as well. http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule250 [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule250]\n\nEdited January 20 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304728-short-cut-question/?do=findComment&comment=3875371","commentId":3875371,"userName":"Silblade","timestamp":1579531761,"content":"@sappidus [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/251007-sappidus/] Thx for answer. I thought that but wasn't 100% sure. It's shame for Short Cut, when \"when revealed\" effects cannot be cancelled by this card, thus reducing its usefulness. It means that the effect of Strider's Path triggers AFTER possible \"when revealed\" effect of location as well, right?\n\"Response: After a location is revealed from the encounter deck, immediately travel to that location without resolving its Travel effect. If another location is currently active, return it to the staging area.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304728-short-cut-question/?do=findComment&comment=3875380","commentId":3875380,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1579532724,"content":"Also yes.
