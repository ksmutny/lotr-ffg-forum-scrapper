I know there's been some debate on the Aragorn/Theodred interaction, but I'm thinking about Beorn/Sneak Attack. If you use Sneak Attack to bring Beorn into play, attack with him triggering his Action to get +5 attack, which effect triggers at the end of the phase? Does he go to your hand or get shuffled back in? Would you be able to choose which one to process?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45941-simultaneous-actions/?do=findComment&comment=460721","commentId":460721,"userName":"CrowOfPyke","timestamp":1304016340,"content":"Mestrahd said:\n\nHow does the game handle simultaneous actions?
