The idea behind this is that for one month (February ’12), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular scenario with particular deck building requirements in a 2 Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes used, and any additional narrative you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-month lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this month are valid. As the month unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the month.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].\n\nWill you place in the final Top Ten? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this month’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the month is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this 2 Player Tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104&efpag=0].\n\nAnd now… on to this month’s 2 Player Tournament!\n\n2 Player Tournament #3:\n\nScenario: The Massing at Osgiliath\nDeck Parameters: Each Player may use 1-3 Core Sets + All Shadows of Mirkwood APs\nNumber of Players: 2 Players\n\nTop Ten:\n\n1.

We then booked it across the Pelennor in one turn!

We killed the witch king in the first game and ran away as fast as possible in the last 2 games. Playing with a pair of dwarf decks meant we could quest for about 30 on the last turn, exhausting all the characters and hoping we didn't turn over too much extra threat. It feels wrong to exhaust everything when you have a witch king and Uruk Vanguard engaged with you but that was the way we played it and it produced good scores.\n\n3 Game, 3 Wins = time to retire to the inn to sing songs of glory."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59857-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-2-player-tournament-3-february-12-completed/?do=findComment&comment=599371","commentId":599371,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1330340648,"content":" @ Memetix: Didn´t you mean you used Bilbo instead of BIFUR?!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59857-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-2-player-tournament-3-february-12-completed/?do=findComment&comment=599375","commentId":599375,"userName":"Memetix","timestamp":1330341678,"content":"muemakan said:\n\n @ Memetix: Didn´t you mean you used Bilbo instead of BIFUR?!!\n\n\n\nDefinitely Bifur - I was playing a dwarf deck (no hobbits allowed).\n\nBifur was pretty essential, using his ability both Miner of the iron hills and Erebor hammersmith can be played on turn 1 to block the wolves."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59857-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-2-player-tournament-3-february-12-completed/?do=findComment&comment=599378","commentId":599378,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1330341917,"content":"Memetix said:\n\n \n\nmuemakan said:\n\n \n\n @ Memetix: Didn´t you mean you used Bilbo instead of BIFUR?!!\n\n \n\n \n\nDefinitely Bifur - I was playing a dwarf deck (no hobbits allowed).\n\nBifur was pretty essential, using his ability both Miner of the iron hills and Erebor hammersmith can be played on turn 1 to block the wolves.\n\n \n\n \n\nOh no, just caught that too.
