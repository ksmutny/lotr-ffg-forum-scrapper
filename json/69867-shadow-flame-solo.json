That deck runs Aragorn, Beravor, and Frodo, so I have Frodo's ability to save my bacon on the turns that I can't play one of the decks many allies. Typically, you need to spit out an ally every turn against this quest, so that will almost certainly mandate that you get ahead of the card draw (more than 1 per turn), unless your **entire** deck is allies. Of course, if your entire deck is allies, you won't get ahead of the questing and monster killing (since you'll lose an ally every turn), so draw is rather critical.\n\nA Test of Will is vital in this quest (as in most), and try to always, always, always cancel Counterspell.\n\nGood luck!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69867-shadow-flame-solo/?do=findComment&comment=681718","commentId":681718,"userName":"Memetix","timestamp":1345864273,"content":"I've only played it once, I don't like to \"spoil\" a quest so I didn't know what was coming …..

Why not make a more thematic and less specific deck, Háma Elrond Bilbo sounds a bit pushy in terms of the theme, and I guess it doesn't work that well against some more willpower-demanding quests.\n\nAlso, I don't see how Counter-Spell is not a problem. There is little chance to prevent it - no Denethor, Risk Some Light too costly without secrecy, Out of the Wild also… or cancel it--the chance is it will come before you have both Vilya and A Test. Once Counter-spell is there, the whole Feint strategy goes up the chimney, together with your hand probably. Further, if you don't draw Feint (over 40 percent chance) you have to face Balrog round 1 almost guaranteed (with this low questing deck). Of course you can feed him allies--for some time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69867-shadow-flame-solo/?do=findComment&comment=682214","commentId":682214,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1345952664,"content":"About counter spell.

For whatever reason, I see way too many posts on various forums that say something like, \"It seems like I need three Core Sets--is this really the case?\" For my part, I just try to point out that extra Cores are a luxury and not a necessity. Players should feel free to expand their deckbuilding options, but they are also able to have a satisfying game experience--and defeat any scenario--without buying the same product three times. I feel that's an important point of emphasis..\n\nSpeaking anecdotally, there's next to no correlation between number of Core Sets owned and player skill; I know some great players who use three and some similarly excellent gamers who get by just fine with one. You're absolutely right that there's no reason to belittle a player for using three copies of Core cards (since, after all, that's perfectly acceptable according to the rules). I do think it's often more interesting to play with just one Core (as it forces you to be slightly more creative), but it's not inherently better or worse than including full playsets. Do whatever makes the game fun for you.\n\nLastly, my sig is meant in jest (just in case the patent lunacy of the statement didn't make that clear. There is no link between masculinity and # of Core Sets). \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69867-shadow-flame-solo/?do=findComment&comment=683595","commentId":683595,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1346138492,"content":"benhanses said:\n\nGlaurung said:\n\n \n\nAbout 2 core set or 2 core set .

I played with one of Glaurung's decks and I know why he thinks the game isn't difficult enough.

But this game is not same as other PVP so here is different logic.\n\nAnyway as you say cool deck can play against all quests not only the certain ones. So berofe SOF and Battle in Lake-town my Aragorn/Denethor/Glorifindel(FOS) can do it but now is terrible fall to this 2 last super quests. Os now i have a new deck Elrond/Hama/Glorifindel(FOS) with Vilya, Eagles, Cycling Feint and this deck sure can be Rule them all deck. But still need tuning!!!!

As in building decks for entire cycles. The \"one deck to rule them all\" has been a goal of deck builders form day one. Though I think it is pretty hard to loose using Hama, that deck is pretty much the deck that can beat all quests. Personally I make decks for entire cycles.\n\nIf you wish to gimp yourself by making less powerful decks then that is cool.. more power to you.. people have been making \"thematic\" decks for as long as CCGs have been around, and they have always been weaker. It is ridiculous to say though that people who are following the rules should have to think less critically, creatively and produce weaker decks to balance the game for the designers."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69867-shadow-flame-solo/?do=findComment&comment=683844","commentId":683844,"userName":"Troymk1","timestamp":1346163977,"content":" The Elrond Deck I posted in the Strategy section has been working REALLY well to do just that.  \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69867-shadow-flame-solo/?do=findComment&comment=684224","commentId":684224,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1346217449,"content":" repair                                               "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69867-shadow-flame-solo/?do=findComment&comment=684248","commentId":684248,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1346220242,"content":"Troymk1 said:\n\n The Elrond Deck I posted in the Strategy section has been working REALLY well to do just that.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nYes your deck is pretty cool.

Score will be really high. But…….actually this is a problem of the Elrond deck: quite slowly. You win yes but with a high scores.

Cose when you play for scores is change a lot and force you to risk as well. Before i try it i also though is not interesting but when i try it…….. is pretty cool and change game a lot. Then look quest log and you will see some interesting results there."}]}
