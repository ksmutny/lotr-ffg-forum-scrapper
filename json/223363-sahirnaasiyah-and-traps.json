Will a trap there -- say, Poisoned Stakes -- attach to one of them?\n\nÂ \n\nAs I interpret it, all staging-area traps create passive effects. Both of the elite Raider enemies have passive effects that pull them out of the staging area \"immediately\" after adding them there. But I should be able to choose the order of passive effect resolution and therefore attach Poisoned Stakes to one of them (of my choice), right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223363-sahirnaasiyah-and-traps/?do=findComment&comment=2279983","commentId":2279983,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1466741630,"content":"Yes."}]}
