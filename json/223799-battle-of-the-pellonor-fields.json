At the end of that battle, Aragorn and his companions capture the Black Fleet and use the Corsair ships to sail up Anduin to Minas Tirith. Then, when you play The Battle of the Pelennor Fields in Campaign Mode, you, your friends, and all the heroes at Minas Tirith must endure the waves of Mordor's armies as they wait for Aragorn to travel up the river in his captured ships. And when the last resource token is finally removed from The Corsair Fleet, you can once again take control of Aragorn.\n\nJust as in the books, the arrival of Isildur’s Heir can turn the tide of the battle. But that’s not the only thing that can tip the scales: The Witch-king also held forces in reserve. When the players advance to stage 5A in campaign mode, the campaign card instructs the players to add each Harad enemy recorded in the campaign log to the staging area.

I love the narrative flow through the different quest stages, as the pressure and the stakes get higher (but there are also moments of hope when Rohan and Aragorn arrive).\n\n \n\nI had thought that the quest might involve players on separate stages (if there were multiple players) to represent the Rohirrim getting closer to Gondor and finally arriving. That wouldn't work well for solo, though. My theme OCD is slightly disappointed because it feels like Rohan heroes shouldn't be present at the start of the game, but I'll get over it. The Rohan player's contributions will represent the fact that Witch-King diverted an army to try to stop Rohan from reaching Minas Tirith.\n\n \n\nI wonder how significant Aragorn's arrival will be. He has good stats (and potentially Sword that was Broken), but I wonder whether there will be any encounter cards that are less bad if Aragorn's in play (or perhaps the fellowship player card in the box will really help for this quest, but Aragorn needs to be in play to use it).\n\n \n\nWay to go, Caleb!

Eomer certainly plays a much larger role in the part of the book in question than Beregond does, but on the other hand it would be strange to get two Rohan and no Gondor heroes, when the story takes place in Gondor. Actually the two largest characters for the Battle are probably Theoden and Denethor (well, not counting Aragorn and Gandalf) but we shan't get them for obvious reasons.\n\nWhere was the art for the new Beregond? If he indeed is the one, it will be amusing to get him together with Eowyn: a Spirit defender (provided his stats remain) and a Tactics quester.

Makes a good duo with a 4 quester in Tactics. Leadership would be interesting, but honestly all of our recent Leadership heroes have been so defensive I am getting a bit tired. Erkenbrand, Amarthiúl, Denethor, even Elfhelm if yu give him a mount will be used mostly for defense... and Halbarad and Faramir don't really help the situation.

However, in this case, it is hardly a competition because both Éomer and Beregond have some very emotional moments but Éomer is followed much more intensely (his emotions too).
