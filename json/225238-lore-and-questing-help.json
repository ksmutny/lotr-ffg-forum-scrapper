Ravens of the Mountains is also decent. But Lore's greatest ability for questing is scrying: the ability to look at the encounter deck and see what's coming. Henamarth Riversong is unparalleled in solo, but there's also Lore Denethor hero, Risk Some Light, Needful to Know, and Rumour from the Earth."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225238-lore-and-questing-help/?do=findComment&comment=2315154","commentId":2315154,"userName":"JJ48","timestamp":1468853269,"content":"> Hi deck builders!\n> \n> I'm new to the game and have been absolutely loving it.

To do that, you'll have to figure out how to build up enough willpower to outstrip the encounter deck--and Spirit is the sphere that does that best. Eowyn is by no means required, but she definitely helps.\n\n \n\nUsually I pay close attention to how many resources I'm spending per point of willpower. With your current cardpool, you don't have many good ally options for cheap willpower--Bofur (tactics) is pretty good value, but everyone else is either temporary or two-for-one cost to willpower. You can offset this somewhat with Faramir (leadership), but otherwise you'll probably be relying on high-willpower heroes to get you through.\n\n \n\nI think you've got the right idea, given your current cardpool. Definitely give Radagast's Cunning and Secret Paths a try if you haven't yet, they're another great way to gain some ground in the quest phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225238-lore-and-questing-help/?do=findComment&comment=2315588","commentId":2315588,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1468863920,"content":"After giving it a little more thought, you might consider picking up The Watcher in the Water.

I'm trying to do cycles but I also want to maximize the enjoyment of my playing time, and from what I've heard the first cycle is hit or miss. I got the saga expansions for the player cards/theme/excellent reviews (the buyer's guide has TBR as one of the best expacs in the whole game, looking forward to it) and also because I'm the only one bankrolling the whole thing. I'll probably try to do all of the Dwarrowdelf cycle and get Return to Mirkwood for Dain Ironfoot.\n\n \n\nThe Northern Trackers, Elf Stones and Ancestral Knowledge have been saving our bacon in Moria. Here's hoping that good luck holds out."}]}
