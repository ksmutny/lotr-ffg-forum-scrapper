My replies are in bold below:\n\n1) How do you keep the decks divided in your storage? \n\nI use carboard dividers with designs printed out from BGG. All my cards are in 4 core boxes (the previous type) one of which has the AP, tokens, decks & sideboard I'm currently using, another two boxes have APs, and the fourth box just has player cards. Each box has 3 columns for cards with wooden type dividers purchased from a UK company called OpticalPower. Believe it or not but I own just about everything and the boxes are nearly full! I do not sleeve cards as that's far too much like hard work. \n\n2) How many Core Sets do you have?\n\nThree\n\n3) And how big's your sideboard? \n\nApprox 20 x 3 cards. It tends to be general purpose power cards such as Gandalf, Miner of the Iron Hills etc. Several are healing cards. Interestingly many of them come from the core set - with 6 years experience under my belt, I can now see just how powerful core decks are when you have 3x of everything.   \n\n4) Where's Northern Tracker?\n\nIn my sideboard. It actually doesn't get used that often - it's very expensive and not all APs have large numbers of locations anyway. I prefer cards that boost the WP of characters - ally-Faramir or Aragorn/Sword that was broken are good examples. \n\n5) Are any cards in multiple factions?\n\nYes - generally up to a maximum of 4 different cards (for instance my Gondor Swarm decks needs Ally-Faramir, Gandalf, Sneak Attack, and Steward of Gondor all of which are in the sideboard). What I do is write on the dividers which cards go into that particular deck from the sideboard. I then take them out at the end of the game and put them back into the sideboard. It takes 10 seconds or so. \n\n6) What spheres are each faction? \n\nGondor Swarm - (all Leadership)\n\nHobbits (Lore, Leadership, Spirit)\n\nRohirrim (Spirit, Tactics)\n\nDwarves (Tactics, Leadership, Lore)\n\nDunedain (all leadership)\n\nOutlands - (Lore, leadership, Spirit)\n\nNoldor - (Tactics, spirit, lore)\n\nSindar - (Leadership, Lore, Spirit)\n\nI am generally rigorous as to what cards go into each deck - for example the Dunedain deck only has cards related to them (no Steward of Gondor!) The exceptions are my two power decks (see below) where I will add in non-faction cards as needed to boost power (i.e. Steward of Gondor goes into my Dwarf deck). Leadership is my favourite sphere - Tactics my least favourite. There are quite a few tri-sphere decks which I find work out OK. \n\n7) Do you play 2 handed, so that you can have multiple spheres covered?\n\nNo just one handed. I find 2 handed too difficult to keep track of.\n\n8 ) If you play 2 handed, do you find yourself playing certain pairs of faction decks together, or do you want (or need) to force yourself to pair up different decks?\n\nNot applicable. When I started I did play a variant called the Fellowship Rules. This combines two hands into one. It makes the game easier which I needed as a new player with a limited deck pool. It also reduces the bookkeeping needed for 2 decks. If you're interested I'll post the rules. \n\n9) How often do you find yourself wanting (or needing) to break up your factions in order to play a multi-faction super-group/\"Avengers\" deck in order to beat a quest or cycle? \n\nInteresting question. The decks above have different power levels. The Dwarf and Gondor Swarm decks are really powerful and can beat just about anything with exceptions - as a rule I don't really need to modify those decks. The rest have medium power and struggle against the most difficult APs (i.e. Carn Dum). The Hobbit deck is still really weak - not enough will power. Having said that, it's interesting as to which decks succeed against different quests; for example my Gondor deck with its numerous but weak allies struggled against Into Ithilien whereas my Dunedain deck with its powerful but expensive allies succeeded first time. I do occasionally break down decks and form new decks - for example the Hobbit deck is a new creation which was born out of a Merry/Pippin/Treebeard deck which just had Hobbit and Ent cards.  \n\n10) Do you find yourself resisting the breaking up the factions, or are you able to easily assemble your super-team and then re-sort back into factions when you're done? ﻿\n\nI will very occasionally modify decks if I want to create a Rohirrim deck that beats everything for example. That's rare though - if it's clear that a deck won't defeat an AP without extensive modification I usually give up on it - after all I have 7 other decks to play with, one of which will likely succeed at some point! Like yourself I also don't want to have to modify decks all the time. \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278717-alternatives-to-manually-sorting-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3394519","commentId":3394519,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1530732497,"content":"Wow, thanks a bunch for those awesome answers!\n\nIt looks like you have a very good system for being able to play a quest quickly (with very little card fiddling before/after play), while at the same time having a lot of variety since you maintain not just one main deck but several.\n\nOut of curiosity, where are your ents now?  And eagles?  Do you ever let them \"tag along\" or do they tend to stay in the box?\n\nAlso, when you start a new quest, with how many decks do you try to beat it, before continuing to the next quest?\n\nAnd finally, which of those decks would you use against Escape from Dol Guldur?  Or is that a quest which you're prefer to tackle 2-handed (or with those fellowship rules you mentioned)?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278717-alternatives-to-manually-sorting-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3394580","commentId":3394580,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1530735132,"content":"The system I have works for me. Like you I don't want to fiddle with decks endlessly (I don't mind it now and again) and this approach allows me to do that. \n\nOut of curiosity, where are your ents now?  And eagles?  Do you ever let them \"tag along\" or do they tend to stay in the box?\n\nI really enjoyed the Ent/Hobbits deck I mentioned above but it was another fairly low power deck that eventually became frustrating. The Ents having to exhaust when they come into play is a real disadvantage. Currently they are unused but I might bring them out again sometime as they were fun. \n\nI've never really got into the Eagles, and they've actually been unplayed for some years. I tried them when I first got into the game, but found them low in WP and expensive for what you get. I notice that new Eagles cards are coming in the latest APs - I am watching this closely to see whether my view of them changes.  \n\nAlso, when you start a new quest, with how many decks do you try to beat it, before continuing to the next quest?\n\nThat depends. I am currently replaying the Heirs of Numenor/Against the Shadow scenarios. My last game was into Ithilien. That scenario went like this:\n\nGondor Swarm - won it on the 4th try\n\nDwarves - won it on the 1st go quite easily\n\nDunedain - won it on the 1st go\n\nRohirrim - completely beaten on the first try. Didn't bother again.\n\nSindar - fought hard but beaten on the 1st try. Tried a second time and again defeated. Gave up.\n\nNoldor - completely beaten on the first try. Didn't bother again.\n\nHobbits - completely beaten on the first try. Didn't bother again.\n\nOutlands - didn't use. I'm a bit bored of this deck, so at some point may get rid of it and create a new one. \n\nWith other APs such as Carn Dum, I didn't bother with the lesser decks as I knew they wouldn't have a chance. \n\nAnd finally, which of those decks would you use against Escape from Dol Guldur?  Or is that a quest which you're prefer to tackle 2-handed (or with those fellowship rules you mentioned)?﻿\n\nI think that I haven't used any of them against Dol Guldor (trying to remember). I've only beaten that scenario with the 6 Heroes fellowship variant that I mentioned above. I should probably get it out and test my Dwarf deck against it and see how that does. One scenario I did have to create a new deck for was Rhosgobel - I created a lore deck with lots of healing cards for that one. I knew what I wanted though, and it didn't take long to do. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278717-alternatives-to-manually-sorting-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3394611","commentId":3394611,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1530737514,"content":"> 13 hours ago, tripecac said:\n> \n> I enjoy handling, looking at, and reading about the cards.  I like listening to the podcasts and watching the progression series videos.  I read the forum (and BGG) on an almost daily basis.  I daydream about playing.\n\nI think this is a good way to enjoy this game.
