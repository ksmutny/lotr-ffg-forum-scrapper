It wouldn't surprise me that much if they went with Galadriel although we probably deserve more than one Gondor hero in this cycle?\n\nThere is another hunch.

I have a theory that after the Black Riders, or alongside the Lord of the Rings saga, the next deluxe is bound to be about Elves. I mean who else is left, right? We shall get Hobbits and perhaps also Dúnedain with the Black Riders (one of the spoilt cards mentions Rangers), so the next obvious cycle must be Elves.\n\nThen again if the both heroes are mono-decks oriented, it would also make little sense if they're both Gondor. And unless we get a second copy of either Denethor or Imrahil, there are no obvious Gondor hero choices.\n\nIf we get four mono-boosters, it may be they are each from different race, thus Gondor, Rohan, Silvan, and Dúnedain/Noldor/Hobbit would make most sense. But I hope it is not another Hobbit if four are coming with the first saga box.\n\nFinally, if we guess correctly (the few of us who said so) and we get Leadership mono-booster Faramir, what do you think his ability shall be? It will probably only affect heroes but based on Théoden and Mirlonde there's no telling whether all of them or only those you control.
