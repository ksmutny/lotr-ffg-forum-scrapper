I am looking to sell my modest collection of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game and am wondering if this is an appropriate place to do so, or if someone could recommend where an appropriate place to do so is. I have 1 core set that has been played a handful of times and the Heirs of Numenor deluxe expansion and the entire Against the Shadow cycle, which have been unpackaged, but never played and have just sat in the box. Really, I'd like to sell this all together, because that's easier for me, but I'm also open to breaking it up if there's a pack someone is in need of. Any direction on where to do this, or if this is an appropriate place to do this, would be appreciated!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251720-appropriate-not-appropriate-where/?do=findComment&comment=2828001","commentId":2828001,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1496941698,"content":"I've seen people sell their collections on the LotR LCG subreddit:\n\nreddit.com/r/lotrlcg/"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251720-appropriate-not-appropriate-where/?do=findComment&comment=2828920","commentId":2828920,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1496989882,"content":"Where are you shipping it from?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251720-appropriate-not-appropriate-where/?do=findComment&comment=2829305","commentId":2829305,"userName":"DeepOneRisen","timestamp":1497017153,"content":"> 7 hours ago, Yepesnopes said:\n> \n> Where are you shipping it from?\n\nUtah"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251720-appropriate-not-appropriate-where/?do=findComment&comment=2829713","commentId":2829713,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1497026779,"content":"Pitty, I am in EU or in Australia otherwise I would buy it all"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251720-appropriate-not-appropriate-where/?do=findComment&comment=2829851","commentId":2829851,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1497030914,"content":"You can consider joining the Lord of the Rings: The Card Game facebook group to see if anyone is interested.\n\nAlso I PM'd you some questions."}]}
