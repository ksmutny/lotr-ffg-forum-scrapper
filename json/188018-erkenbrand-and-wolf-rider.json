An enemy attacks you, you exhaust a character to declare it as the defender against that attack. The shadow card is the Wolf Rider, which makes a new attack. That attack either requires a new defender, or it must be taken undefended. Full stop. There is no reading of the rules as written in which the already-exhausted defender defending against the original attack gets to also defend against the Wolf Rider's attack unless you have played a card effect that lets exhausted characters defend.\n\nTL;DR - It's a new attack. You must declare a new defender or take the attack undefended."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188018-erkenbrand-and-wolf-rider/?do=findComment&comment=3232581","commentId":3232581,"userName":"gpd924","timestamp":1519871953,"content":"I'll just refer you to my last response.  The shadow card effect would then need to say \"may declare or take direct damage undefended on a hero\"...something to that effect.  Again, clarification is needed.  Please email FFG about this to get it in the next FAQ"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188018-erkenbrand-and-wolf-rider/?do=findComment&comment=3232587","commentId":3232587,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1519872167,"content":"> Just now, gpd924 said:\n> \n> I'll just refer you to my last response.  The shadow card effect would then need to say \"may declare or take direct damage undefended on a hero\"...something to that effect.  Again, clarification is needed.  Please email FFG about this to get it in the next FAQ\n\nWhy is clarification needed?

The equivalent now would surely look more like 'Wolf Rider makes an immediate attack against the defending player'? That would then trigger a framework event (an attack) that has simple steps to follow. The Wolf Rider, belonging to the old days of weird wording describes what it is doing in too much detail, but it is a golden rule of the game that you have to exhaust a character to perform basic actions like defending unless otherwise stated. This is stated in the FAQ in response to a question about Light of Valinor:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Q: If I have Light of Valinor (D 107) attached to a hero I control, can that hero commit to the quest while exhausted?\n> A: No. Characters must be ready and able to exhaust in order to quest, attack, or defend. Card effects that allow a character to perform any of those actions without exhausting do not allow exhausted characters to perform those actions.\n\nIt's a bit of a leap, but there's nothing in the Wolf Rider card to imply that a character can defend it while exhausted.\n\nThose core set cards are often a bit buggy!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188018-erkenbrand-and-wolf-rider/?do=findComment&comment=3233117","commentId":3233117,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1519918359,"content":"I think that Erkenbrand technically should be able to cancel the Wolf Rider's attack as long as he is still considered defending.
