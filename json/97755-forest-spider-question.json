During encounter phase the spider Engages me. Spider ability says forced: when he engages a player he gets + 1 attack till end of turn. Does forest spider get this buff every round if I don't kill him. I don't know if it means when he initially engages me. Thanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97755-forest-spider-question/?do=findComment&comment=964066","commentId":964066,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1390621372,"content":"Just until the end of the round.  If he stays engaged with you, then he will only use his printed attack value of 2 on the next turn.  If you were to use some card to return him to the staging area, like A Light in the Dark, and then engage the spider a second time, he would get the buff once more."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97755-forest-spider-question/?do=findComment&comment=964101","commentId":964101,"userName":"la1cajun","timestamp":1390627547,"content":"Gotcha , thanks,"}]}
