Heck, maybe later on there will be an enemy that focuses on 1 on 1 battle and does not allow your character to do anything else until defeated (or if they kill a character, another must be chosen or some ill effect happens.) That would be an interesting idea. They really could still go in so many directions with new cards."}]}
