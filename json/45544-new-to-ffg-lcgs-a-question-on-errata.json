Now, I can deal with errata in a standard FFG board game just fine without any hassle. But if I am to get this LCG and the expansions that follow, how do these errors feel compared to a board game? Doesn't having to check for corrections in a somewhat faster paced game break the flow and become rather annoying? With every release of a card pack, there will be even more corrections needed and even more to look through in the errata during gameplay.\n\nIs this something to be concerned about, or am I not making a valid enough reason to hesitate on the purchase? How do the other LCGs work, now that there is a errata that has corrections for the cards (for example, the Call of Cthulhu LCG)?\n\nThanks in advance for the input!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45544-new-to-ffg-lcgs-a-question-on-errata/?do=findComment&comment=456814","commentId":456814,"userName":"Darksbane","timestamp":1303343846,"content":"Generally you just end up memorizing the errata. I play all 3 of their other LCGs and each one has perhaps 20 or so cards with errata. It is easy enough to memorize."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45544-new-to-ffg-lcgs-a-question-on-errata/?do=findComment&comment=456990","commentId":456990,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1303374516,"content":"Yeap huppens to all card games.They don't give you a new card with a new text but in their site they tell you how this card must be palyed.At Lord tcg we had more than 40 cards with errata and clarification and after some games you can easy memorize them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45544-new-to-ffg-lcgs-a-question-on-errata/?do=findComment&comment=457007","commentId":457007,"userName":"Sky","timestamp":1303375919,"content":"You can also wait for second edition :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].
