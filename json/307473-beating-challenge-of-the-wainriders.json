If the penaly is not too bad for you board state (Stage 2 for a Silvan deck with Silvan Tracker out, Stage 3 for an ally swarm deck) and you don't have or need the progress tokens carried over to the next stage you can basically decide to fail the test by sending some weak character to the test in order to preserve more useful actions.\n\nThis is a quest which generally rewards high willpower and a bit of turtling in the first stage (but not too much).\n\nEdited April 11 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307473-beating-challenge-of-the-wainriders/?do=findComment&comment=3926484","commentId":3926484,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1586608268,"content":"> 13 hours ago, asgardianphil said:\n> \n> aggressive racer.

I really enjoyed playing the deck but felt it should have focused to either ents or eagles not both. Support for the eagles was problematic in that it could only be played from to top of the deck using Gandalf's ability as it has an attachment condition to it. Wizard Pipe helps set that up but it's a bit long winded for a deck that's partially devoted to eagles. I'd be in favour of going full-on eagle and radagast with it. \n\nI picked the deck, mainly due to the effect of  crowded track, in that it offered few characters with higher will power and trying to keep to the strider limit. I think the eagles entering and leaving play could do alright though.

Little piece of advice (you might already know this but still), don't take the printed difficulty rating of the quests as accurate, they are often all over the place.

I would consider adding Tale of Tinuviel as another way to use Galadriel or Glorfindel willpower, remove the Trackers and Valiant Determination, put in some Knight of Belfalas and/or Erebor Guard . Otherwise if you want to keep a full spirit lineup you could go with a Caldara/Arwen/Beregond with the usual shenanings, or if you want to go for a full location control you might consider a Idraen/Glorfindel/Lore Noldor (Elrond or Galdor) to use The Hidden Way to take full advantage of your focus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307473-beating-challenge-of-the-wainriders/?do=findComment&comment=3928684","commentId":3928684,"userName":"asgardianphil","timestamp":1587210654,"content":"Game #5.\n\nI started making the amendments that Alonewolf87 mentioned but then as I was doing it had an idea to do a deck around 3 Esgaroth Guardians buffed up to 5s across their stats but also make them Gondorian for some Gondor Synergy. \n\n \n\nSetup. \n\nHeroes: Arwen, Aragorn (leadership) and Boromir (leadership)\n\nThreat 32.\n\nDraws: Elrond's Council, Elven-light, Sneak Attack, Tale of Tinúviel, Steward Of Gondor and Valiant Sacrifice.

I might recommend some Rhovanion Outrider for the Dale deck to better handle the locations in the staging area; some Valiant Determination/Wild Stallion Guardian of Esgaroth might also work wonders in this quest.\n\nEdited July 16 by Alonewolf87"}]}
