Reprint cycles take about 6 months or so. But LOTR packs always come and go with stock, especially the first two cycles, due to the popularity of the game. Dunno how quickly they're snatched up, though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242535-adventure-pack-scarcity/?do=findComment&comment=2639000","commentId":2639000,"userName":"Crusaderlord","timestamp":1487024998,"content":"Yes those are awaiting reprint. The good news is that all the packs do seem to keep getting a reprint so eventually you will get the missing ones. It is a testament to the popularity of the game that the re-print packs do sell out again. I cant be sure how quickly they sell out, depends on the country you are in. I would pick them up when they come out though rather than wait around. This game demand seems to just keep on going so I cant see them stopping the supply."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242535-adventure-pack-scarcity/?do=findComment&comment=2639251","commentId":2639251,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1487040534,"content":"> 5 hours ago, swimmingordy said:\n> \n> Greetings!\n> \n> Long time player of FFG games, and just now going full throttle on LotR LCG and LOVING it.  As my OCD requires me to compete the set, I am in search of some of the older adventure packs in an attempt to collect and play chronologically.  I've stalled out in the Dwarrowdelf cycle not being able to find:\n> \n> -Watcher in the Water\n> \n> -Foundations of Stone\n> \n> -Shadow and Flame\n> \n> The website just says \"out of stock\" with no estimated reprint date.  For those of you more experienced players, how often do reprints come and if so, how quickly are they snatched up?\n> \n> Aside from eBay and FLGS, anyone have any other avenues to purchase some of the older sets?  Thanks!\n\n \n\nCheck thewarstore.com or miniaturemarket.com"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242535-adventure-pack-scarcity/?do=findComment&comment=2639576","commentId":2639576,"userName":"kaisergav","timestamp":1487068243,"content":"\"Foundations of Stone\" and \"Shadow and Flame\" were easy enough to find in the UK until recently.\n\n\"Watcher in the Water\", on the other hand...  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242535-adventure-pack-scarcity/?do=findComment&comment=2639680","commentId":2639680,"userName":"tomtom","timestamp":1487078875,"content":"Here you are, if you don't mind shipping cost:\n\nhttp://www.rebel.pl/category.php/1,1849/Dwarrowdelf.html [http://www.rebel.pl/category.php/1,1849/Dwarrowdelf.html]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242535-adventure-pack-scarcity/?do=findComment&comment=2655715","commentId":2655715,"userName":"Ceahorse","timestamp":1487947887,"content":"Crusader Lord.
