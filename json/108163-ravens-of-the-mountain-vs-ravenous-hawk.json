I played Ravens of the Mountain and we found the Ravenous Hawk.\n\n \n\nffg_ravens-of-the-mountain-otd.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_ravens-of-the-mountain-otd.jpg]                   uMEN04-card-05.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/nightmare-decks/uMEN04-06/uMEN04-card-05.png]\n\n \n\nI wondered what the outcome would be. I thought the following. We engage the ravenous hawk because we looked at it because of a card effect, and afterwards he returns to the top of the encounter deck because Ravens of the Mountains explicitely states that the card goes to the top of the encounter deck. Was this play correct or not?\n\n \n\nSome explanation would be nice.\n\n \n\nEdits: Typo's\n\nEdited June 7, 2014 by Jban"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108163-ravens-of-the-mountain-vs-ravenous-hawk/?do=findComment&comment=1112626","commentId":1112626,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1402183701,"content":"There is no more explanation than that... you might want to ask Caleb if you want a definitive answer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108163-ravens-of-the-mountain-vs-ravenous-hawk/?do=findComment&comment=1112647","commentId":1112647,"userName":"Tarkan","timestamp":1402185829,"content":"The Hawks forced effect never trigger, since the Ravens doesn't instruct you to look at cards.

I think I read somewhere that forced effects can only trigger on cards that are already in play. If you draw the card as a result of the forced effect on quest card 1B or 2B you are only looking at it and it isn't technically considered to be in play until you choose to reveal it. Or am I getting this wrong?\n\n(Edited for clarity)\n\nEdited March 30, 2018 by p_toler"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108163-ravens-of-the-mountain-vs-ravenous-hawk/?do=findComment&comment=3267103","commentId":3267103,"userName":"p_toler","timestamp":1522395092,"content":"I just noticed the new Rules Reference document.
