Also, lotr doesn't have an explicit disrupt/interrupt mechanism, so Response/Forced are allowed to act as interrupts, resolving at times that might otherwise seem strange.  \n\nI also agree with you that the use of \"total threat\" implies that using a calculated value is plausible. Certainly if they had written \"printed threat\", or \"after an enemy is destroyed\", then you would use zero.\n\nGiven these I would resolved the Forced during the destruction process, before I had discarded the tokens that given him threat, and thus add the threat. I am also pretty comfortable saying intent is on this side of the argument."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255735-wraith-on-wings-threat-in-battle-of-the-pelennor-fields/?do=findComment&comment=2917464","commentId":2917464,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1502141150,"content":"Yeah, it seems to be a time where the mechanics don't match with a pretty clearly communicated intent.  Unless I'm misunderstanding the word \"destroyed.\"  Whether you use the words \"when an enemy is destroyed\" or \"after an enemy is destroyed,\" either way the trigger seems to me not to be able to fire until the card is in the discard pile, since there are no intervening steps in the \"destruction process.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255735-wraith-on-wings-threat-in-battle-of-the-pelennor-fields/?do=findComment&comment=2918230","commentId":2918230,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1502195966,"content":"\"When an enemy with victory point is destroyed put it in victory pile instead of the discard pile\" mean that the enemy is directly put on victory pile.

You don't move an enemy to the discard before it's destroyed, so the only remaining options are moving it to the discard when it's destroyed or after it's destroyed. In the former case, it shares a trigger with the quest card and you can resolve the quest card first. In the latter case, you would have to perform the quest card first by placing however many tokens. Either way, you can get the progress, which is also what I believe to be the designer intent (based on lack of the word \"printed\").\n\nThat's how I make sense of it anyway."}]}
