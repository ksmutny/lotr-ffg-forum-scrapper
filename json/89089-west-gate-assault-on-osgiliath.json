This action allows you to place West gate as active and go get the 1 threat location that also has surge. (which is progressed by killing enemies)\n\n \n\nSo it's a great effect.  If you quest effectively and destroy 2 enemies you gain 2 locations that turn! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89089-west-gate-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=848428","commentId":848428,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1377277554,"content":"I read it as when you draw it from the encounter deck, if you have no active locations at the moment, make West gate the active location and find another location to put in the staging area.
