(Limit once per phase.)\n\nI have 2 questions:\n1) Multiple characters participate in an attack, but only 1 is a Dwarf.  Are you able to use Heavy Stroke to consider everyone's combined attack as X?  Or just the attack strength of the Dwarf?  That would seem convoluted -- if 3 characters pool their attack to do 1 damage to a 3-shield enemy, it seems like I'd have to tease apart which character actually did the damage.  Maybe the Dwarf contributed 2 attack strength, the secod ally contributed 1, and it was the 1 attack strength of the 3rd ally that actually caused damage. \n\n2) Does the 'limit once per phase' mean that you can't trigger a second copy of Heavy Stroke, or that you can't recycle the same card and re-use it (e.g., via Hama if you're engaged with at least 3 enemies).\n\nThanks for responses."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79082-heavy-stroke/?do=findComment&comment=761311","commentId":761311,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1360527765,"content":"I'm not an expert, but I interpret it as this:\n\n1) It says \"a Dwarf\", so to me that sounds like one character only.  So, I'm guessing that this card is for Erebor Battle Master or a damaged Gimli, since they can attack solo, but maybe not be quite enough to finish the enemy off.  \n\n2) I think of it as you can only play that card once that phase, whether it's a copy of it or not, since they would have the same name.  So if you had another copy of Heavy Stroke in your hand, or you recycled the same copy with Hama, you couldn't play it until the next phase you have combat.\n\nIf anyone has more information on this, please correct me.  I have also been confused about this card, since it seems a little unfair for it to only work on a single Dwarf."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79082-heavy-stroke/?do=findComment&comment=761362","commentId":761362,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1360546163,"content":"Think I saw something in the latest FAQ stating something along the lines, that heavy stroke can be used in an attack by multiple characters and in that case you get to decide which damage is used to overcome an enemy´s armor and which damage takes a toll on his HP.

In your example, the optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply Aragorn's attack 3 to the enemy's 1 defense. So Aragorn is dealing 2 damage to the enemy and Dwalin is also dealing 2 damage, at which point you play Heavy Stroke to double Dwalin's damage and make it 4 for a total of 6 damage dealt to the enemy.\n\nJust to clarify it further, let's say Aragorn and Dwalin were attacking an enemy with 4 defense. The optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply all 3 of Aragron's attack plus 1 of Dwalin's to beating the enemy's defensse, then Dwalin would deal 1 damage to the enemy that could be double with Heavy Stroke for a total of 2.\n\nHope that helps,\n\n------------------\n\n \n\nSo, it does work in this convoluted way.  Gotta say, I think this is a needless complication, but that's what we've got to work with!  "}]}
