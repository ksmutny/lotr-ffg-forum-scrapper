Doesnt make much sense to me.\n\n \n\nWell I'm trying to keep the numbers down and I don't like having multiple copies of unique cards if I can help it. A little consolidation might help but as this is a solo deck, I'm trying to have it be flexible and able to cover a lot of bases at once. It's done pretty well on Nin-in-Eilph and The Ring Goes South. It does have some trouble with card draw though...\n\nI modified it a bit. Took out Elrond's Counsel since Island Amid Perils does the same thing.\n\nEdited November 3, 2014 by Narsil0420"}]}
