I am going to disagree with Seastan.\n\n \n\nI do not think Gandalf is the best target for Narya, as he already has enough stats. How often do you need a defender with 5 def and 4 hit pionts? Then lesser defensive allies with sentinel is a better target, or a Warden of Healing/Master of the Forge/Gléowine/other allies who exhaust for their ability. If Elrond is in play, then a single Warden heals four damage. That is in most cases better than a 4/5/5/4 ally. Gandalf is a good target, but it exists better options."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206089-awesome-anborn/?do=findComment&comment=2118164","commentId":2118164,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1458666477,"content":"Good points Durin.

A Wellinghall perserver with a burning brand is also a good candidate for defense (healing, 3def, shadow cancellation vs 5 def), or a Beorn who used his ability and attacks for 9? Or even a Saruman, who can attack for 6? I have yet to be convinced."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206089-awesome-anborn/?do=findComment&comment=2118225","commentId":2118225,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1458667354,"content":"I did say \"arguably the best\" not \"the clear best\" which is just to say that an argument could be made.

If someone needs extra resources, you can get two uses from an Errand-rider. If someone needs extra cards, Gleowine or Master of the Forge can be used multiple times. Gildor or Imladris Stargazer can help multiple players. Powerful allies like Treebeard, Gandalf, Beorn and (soon) Glorfindel can be used in multiple phases of the game. It is fun to pick one ally and build a powerful deck around them with Narya, but the underrated aspect of these kinds of effects is how many different ways they can be used. This is especially true in multiplayer games where there is a much greater variety of allies in play.\n\nEdited March 22, 2016 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206089-awesome-anborn/?do=findComment&comment=2118977","commentId":2118977,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1458681090,"content":"..deleted..\n\nEdited March 22, 2016 by JanB"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206089-awesome-anborn/?do=findComment&comment=2129099","commentId":2129099,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1459197915,"content":"I recorded a video of Anborn in action.\n\n \n\nThe deck list I used is here [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/81/dead-on-arrival-2.0].\n\n \n\n\n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206089-awesome-anborn/?do=findComment&comment=2129353","commentId":2129353,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1459207641,"content":"I like how this thread morphed from an Anborn + Sword-Thain + Wingfoot discussion to a Narya discussion.
