No, that's not right. His ability is a response, thus it can can only respond to committing to a quest.

As richsabre pointed out, Aragorn's response can only be triggered immediately after he commits to a quest (which only happens once per round, during the quest phase). Given that, and the fact that responses can only be triggered once per trigger, Aragorn's response can only be used once, and only after he commits to a quest.\n\nAlso, as alpha5099 noted, responses are different from Action: abilities. Responses can only be played immediately after their specified trigger occurs. In later phases of the turn, there will be no opportunity for Aragorn to commit to a quest, so his response trigger cannot happen.\n\nIn short: once, and only right after he commits to the quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58963-official-clarifaction-on-aragorns-ability/?do=findComment&comment=579454","commentId":579454,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1326560327,"content":"Can I just get some clarification here?

Many people seam to get this wrong. You have to pay and ready, before you reveal anything form the encounter deck. You can not pay and ready during any other phase in the game.. only at the VERY INSTANT you tap him to commit to the quest.\n\nAlso quest responses happen all at the same time PER PLAYER. When a player commits to a quest and has more than one quest response, they can just choose what order to do it in. So for example, a common combo is Theodred and Aragorn, using the resource from theodred on Aragorn effectively making not tap to quest. This ONLY works if Aragorn and Theodred are on the same players team, or if the player with Theodred turn is before the aragon player, because turn order requires one player to quest, then the next, then the next. If Theodred is on the same team as Arragon the player simply picks Theodred's response to go first, placing the resource on Aragorn, who then triggers his response. BUT, if they are on different teams, and the player with Theodred is after the player with Arragorn in the turn order, then when Aragorn went to quest he didn't have a resource and couldn't untap by spending it. Then the next player turn to quest, Theodred can place teh resource on aragorn.. but it is TO LATE for aragorn to trigger that response.\n\nAragorn's ability is a bit tricky, it looks very strait forward but it has a few weird rules associated with it.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58963-official-clarifaction-on-aragorns-ability/?do=findComment&comment=1853744","commentId":1853744,"userName":"LE0987","timestamp":1445185144,"content":"booored wrote:\n\n \n\n\"...So for example, a common combo is Theodred and Aragorn, using the resource from theodred on Aragorn effectively making not tap to quest.
