Whilst I probably should have done so, there is no seeding and all starting positions are completely random. I would rather allies of different costs and spheres go up against each other to make the choices harder. I think it will force people to make choices that take in every aspect and potential benefit of each ally rather than just deciding who is the best 4 cost ally, 3 cost etc and having the winners face each other.\n\n \n\nVote for your favorite ally as they enter their match-ups in the comments below. Vote on whatever criteria you desire. You are free to discuss anything you wish but all votes will be counted just once and CANNOT be changed once I record them.\n\n \n\nVoting will close at the end of each week for each bracket. Fifth Round Semi Finals voting has begun and ends on Sunday 13th 11.59PM (GMT +10). If you need to look any allies up to remind yourself of exactly what they do Hall of Beorn is the best place to do so:\n\nhttp://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search]\n\n \n\nuniquelotrlcgallieschampionship.png [http://images.challonge.com/uniquelotrlcgallieschampionship.png]\nEdited September 7, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1730410","commentId":1730410,"userName":"koriakin97","timestamp":1439275683,"content":"A Eomund\n\nB Gwaihir\n\nC Rumil\n\nD Ingold\n\nE Arwen\n\nF Bifur\n\nG Hama\n\nH Gleowine\n\nI   Bofur\n\nJ  Treebeard\n\nK Faramir\n\nL Quickbeam\n\nM Legolas\n\nN Boromir\n\nO Anborn\n\nP Skinbark\n\nQ Bill\n\nR Gandalf\n\n \n\nEdit:\n\nFirst!\n\nEdited August 11, 2015 by koriakin97"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1730433","commentId":1730433,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1439277863,"content":"A Eomund\n\n\nB Elfhelm\n\n\nC Rumil\n\n\nD Ingold\n\n\nE Arwen\n\n\nF Guthlaf\n\n\nG Anborn (Leadership)\n\n\nH Gleowine\n\n\nI   Bofur (Spirit)\n\n\nJ  Treebeard\n\n\nK Gandalf (OHaUH)\n\n\nL Quickbeam\n\n\nM Erestor\n\n\nN Boromir\n\n\nO Anborn (Lore)\n\n\nP Skinbark\n\n\nQ Bill the Pony\n\n\nR Gildor Inglorion\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1730472","commentId":1730472,"userName":"Veve7","timestamp":1439281586,"content":"A-Forlong\n\nB-Elfhelm\n\nC-Rumil\n\nD-Ingold\n\nE-Arwen\n\nF-Bifur\n\nG-Hama\n\nH-Gleowine\n\nI-Kili\n\nJ-Treebeard\n\nK-Faramir\n\nL-Bilbo Baggins\n\nM-Legolas\n\nN-Boromir\n\nO-Dwalin\n\nP-Skinbark\n\nQ-Bill the Pony\n\nR-Gandalf\n\nEdited August 11, 2015 by Veve7"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1730477","commentId":1730477,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1439282302,"content":"As a strong fan of Gildor, i must say it is pretty annoying that you have him battle against that nameless filthy stinky wizard whose name i cannot even speak in middle earth ....

Eomund - Awesome in a Rohan deck, and the only ally besides Gandalf that I ever use with Sneak Attack.\n\nB - Elfhelm - One of the stronger spirit allies, good in a Rohan or Caldara deck.  Eagles still don't seem very playable, despite Gwaihir's tiny crown.\n\nC - Farmer Maggot - I like the idea of Rumil, but he's too expensive to play in a silvan deck.  Farmer Maggot wins for being a hobbit.\n\nD - Brok Ironfist - Only because I actually used his ability once several years ago.  And because I know he's going to lose.\n\nE - Arwen - No contest.  I'm glad we are getting a non-terrible version of Damrod.\n\nF - Guthlaf - Because I like the Rohan/Gondor synergy and I like saying his name.\n\nG - Hama - Great defender potential.  Also, the leadership version of Anborn is far less playable than the lore version.\n\nH - Gleowine - Good, repeatable card draw.\n\nI - Kili - Everyone loves playing the Fili/Kili combo.\n\nJ - Treebeard - He has the potential to win it all.  Plus, the Mablung ally pales in comparison to Mablung hero.\n\nK - Gandalf - Very tough matchup because Faramir ally is also very good.  But OHUH Gandalf can be a total beast.\n\nL - Bilbo - So good for fetching Hobbit Pipes, which is one of my favorite decks.  Meanwhile, Quickbeam is OP.\n\nM - Legolas - The best attacking ally in the game.  Erestor is also pretty good.\n\nN - Boromir - With a little healing, you can often get 2 or 3 actions out of him every turn.  Poor Radagast desperately needs a reboot.\n\nO - Anborn - Bring on the trap deck!\n\nP - Emery - So good in mono spirit.  Plus, you can play her on other people.  Skinbark is also good, but Booming Ents will often be attacking for more and cost less.\n\nQ - Bill the Pony - Bombur ally is terrible, and Bill plays for free.  What's not to like?\n\nR - Gandalf - Gildor is good, too, but I never seem to play him anymore because of his cost.  Meanwhile, Gandalf is playable in almost every deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1730836","commentId":1730836,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1439302014,"content":"A: Forlong\n\nB: Gwaihir\n\nC: Rumil\n\nD: Ingold\n\nE: Arwen\n\nF: Guthlaf\n\nG: Hama\n\nH: Gleowine\n\nI: Spirit Bofur\n\nJ: Treebeard\n\nK: Faramir\n\nL: Quickbeam\n\nM: Legolas\n\nN: Boromir\n\nO: Lore Anborn\n\nP: Emery\n\nQ: Bill the Pony\n\nR: Core Gandalf"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1730888","commentId":1730888,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1439303884,"content":"Ok, here we go\n\n \n\nA: Eomund, cause I have used him in Rohan decks while have never played Forlong\n\nB: Gwaihir, tough but I am more of a tactic player and use a lot of eagles\n\nC: Farmer Maggot, he can kick Nazgul in their butt \n\nD: Ingold, I've always though Brok to be a useless card\n\nE: Arwen, she is very helpfull in quest and defence\n\nF: Guthlaf, cause I play more Rohan than dwarves\n\nG: Hama, have used him and helped me a lot in Helms Deep\n\nH: Gloin, nice Leadership Dwarf ally\n\nI: Kili, cause you get Fili\n\nJ: Treebeard, but Mablung Ally is in the first age custom cards I think\n\nK: Faramir offcourse\n\nL: Quickbeam, used him a lot recently and liked him\n\nM: Legolas, he is ranged and draws a card, with his horse he is even better\n\nN: Radagast, cause he can bring more eagles ... ok he is expensive but he is an Istari after all\n\nO: Anborn, I like his ability\n\nP: Skinbark, do not have him yet but I know I will love him\n\nQ: Bill the Pony, does it need an explanation ? \n\nR: Gildor, who cares about the stinky wizard, Gildor is a mystery of his own \n\nEdited August 11, 2015 by Nickpes"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1730924","commentId":1730924,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1439304988,"content":"A  Forlong\nB  Elfhelm\nC  Rumil\nD  Ingold\nE  Arwen\nF  Bifur\nG  Hama\nH  Gleowine\nI   Bofur \nJ  Treebeard\nK  Faramir\nL  Quickbeam\nM  Legolas\nN  Radagast \nO  Dwalin\nP  Skinbark\nQ  Bill the Pony\nR Gandalf (core set)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1730963","commentId":1730963,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1439306335,"content":"A - Éomund\nB -

Both are questing powerhouses, but Gandalf can shore up multiple weaknesses of a deck on his own, spheres be damned!\nErestor vs. Legolas. Again, both let you see more cards. I went Erestor since I still rather have Hero Legolas much of the time.\nGildor vs. Gandalf (Core). Gildor has solid stats or a great ability to use turn after turn.

Actually Bifur is better but Bifur hero is very good so ally has less chances of seeing play in MP.\n\nG-Hama. Much more efficient, even if Anborn looks very interesting, especially paired with Thalin. 3 cost vs 4 cost is the tiebreaker here.\n\nH-Gleowine. Hard call; Gloin, while still being very good, is not essential to dwarves, whereas Gleowine might help in difficult situations.\n\nI-Bofur. Great ally, helps the most when you need it the most.\n\nJ-Treebeard. Awesome ally: huge combat buff for every non-tactics deck and action advantage too.\n\nK-Faramir. Gandalf needs a deck to be built upon him, and I'm not a fan of that concept, whereas Faramir is just so good...\n\nL-Quickbeam. Bilbo is a very good ally, but Quickbeam has fantastic stats, providing a huge buff to every deck that plays Lore.\n\nM-Legolas. Not a fan of Erestor; Lego gives mono Tactics a new option.\n\nN-Boromir. Don't like either, but Radagast just sucks so..\n\nO-Anborn, in hopes that Trap decks will become viable with new Damrod hero (and it really looks like they could).\n\nP-Emery, hands down.

Cheaper and far more reliable in a mono-Leadership deck.\n\n \n\nAD - Boromir - I wanna say Gamling here since I feel he's going to be really powerful and his art is amazing, but Boromir has proved himself to be great in battle numerous times.\n\n \n\nAE - Anborn - These 2 allies are great, but I'll go with Anborn as I really want to build a trap deck right now.\n\n \n\nAF - Beorn - the quintessential tank ally, plus he doesn't enter play exhausted.\n\n \n\nAG - Bill the Pony - A free 1/1/0 ally that boosts hobbits and can be used as A Very Good Tale fodder? Yes please. Plus, he's really iconic and has great art.\n\n \n\nAH - Gandalf - Same reason as before, just an incredible ally, especially in a deck that runs Leadership. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1740070","commentId":1740070,"userName":"scwont","timestamp":1439835712,"content":"S - Galadriel\n\nT - Rumil\n\nU - Saruman\n\nV - Henamarth Riversong\n\nW - Bifur\n\nX - Hama\n\nY - Gleowine\n\nZ - Bofur (Spirit)\n\nAA - Treebeard\n\nAB - Faramir\n\nAC - Legolas\n\nAD - Boromir\n\nAE - Anborn (Lore)\n\nAF - Beorn\n\nAG - Bill the Pony\n\nAH - Gandalf (Core set)\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1740492","commentId":1740492,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1439848364,"content":"S Galadriel\n\nT Elfhelm\n\nU Ingold\n\nV Arwen\n\nW Haldir of Lorien\n\nX Gimli\n\nY Elrond\n\nZ Bofur (spirit)\n\nAA Treebeard\n\nAB Faramir\n\nAC Legolas\n\nAD Gamling\n\nAE Bofur (tactics)\n\nAF Skinbark\n\nAG Bill the Pony\n\nAH Gandalf (core)\n\nThis time was much easier, a lot of blow outs (or what should be blow outs).

This is actually pretty easy, as Galadriel is very good for all Leadership-heavy decks (that usually lack card draw), whereas Eomund is a much more situational card.\n\nT Rumil. Haven't played either I lot, but my nod goes to Rumil as he can find space in some Tactics deck focused on direct damage (he enables Pursuing the Enemy too).\nU Ingold. Saruman's very situational, and Doomed 3 is huge. Hard to judge considering I've never played Ingold, but the latter looks like a good choice for the typical leadership Gondor deck, so he's potentially more useful.\nV Arwen. No brainer, sorry Hena.\nW Bifur. High risk of hero clash for both, but Bifur wins the day as he is very good in the right deck, whereas Haldir ally is really overcosted for a unique, considering current standards; his only saving grace are the keywords, but the price is so high that you'll almost never want to play him in a sphere that is full of drawing effects - so less chances of 4 spare resources.\nX Gimli. Gimli has a high cost, but action advantage with good stats (possibly improved by Dain). Hama is cheaper and benefits from Rohan synergy, whereas Gimli is not sure to find room in a dwarf deck; however the latter gives better value when he is out. A hard call but I'll choose the Dwarf, this time.\nY Gleowine. Very hard choice; both have their merits, but I'll choose Gleowine since he can provide fantastic value in Solo or in a 2P game, especially when playing with decks that would otherwise lack some card draw.\nZ Bofur (spirit). The Dwarf is a life saver, and that's what usually makes the difference between victory and defeat: having help when you're down. Orophin is good only in a Silvan, and even in there is not a fundamental piece: nice to have but not game changing.\nAA Treebeard. Another no-brainer.\nAB Quickbeam. Ouch, dilemma. Faramir for 3-4 player games, Quickbeam for Solo/2P. Considering cheap allies with awesome stats are always welcome whereas global WP boost is very powerful but you could do without (plus Faramir is very expensive at 4 cost), I'll give my vote to the Ent.\nAC Legolas. Legolas is worth every single resource with his stats and ability, whereas Denethor is just average.\nAD Gamling. I haven't played much with either, but I like Gamling better for his deckbuilding potential. Not a fan of either card though.\nAE Bofur (tactics). Bofur performs an important function within the Tactics sphere, whereas Anborn's usefulness is more limited (and is more expensive).\nAF Skinbark. I choose the Ent for flavor mainly, since I like the design of this card a lot. He is very situational, even though a lot of quests feature Orcs. On the other side, Beorn is the typical cheat-me-into-play ally, and I've actually used him in a few decks, so I quite like him. There's not a clear winner for me.\nAG Bill the Pony. Free ally and love the character.\nAH Gandalf (core).

Not even close so I have to say I strongly disagree with everyone who was upset they were facing each other so early on. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1753576","commentId":1753576,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1440489685,"content":"AI - Galadriel\n\nAJ - Arwen\n\nAK - Gimli\n\nAL - Elrond\n\nAM - Treebeard\n\nAN - Legolas\n\nAO - Beorn\n\nAP - Gandalf"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1753608","commentId":1753608,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1440491980,"content":"AI - Galadriel\n\nAJ - SARUMAN\n\nAK - Gimli\nAL - Elrond\nAM - Treebeard\nAN - Legolas\nAO - Beorn\nAP - Gandalf\n\nEverybody VOTE SARUMAN!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1753642","commentId":1753642,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1440493937,"content":"Rúmil: i have used him more usually than Galadriel\n\nArwen: Saruman is funny, but if i see, i have used him only 1 time in my thousand of games\n\nGimli: Haldir hero can block the Haldir ally, however, Gimli not so often so.\n\nBofur: He is the king of the first rounds.\n\nFaramir: Very powerful ally.\n\nLegolas: who is Gamling?^^\n\nBofur: is more versatile than Beorn\n\nGandalf: no comments"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1753664","commentId":1753664,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1440495001,"content":"AI -   Rumil\n\nAJ -  Arwen\n\nAK -  Haldir of Lorien\n\nAL -  Bofur\n\nAM - Treebeard\n\nAN -  Legolas\n\nAO -  Beorn\n\nAP -  Gandalf\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184799-unique-ally-championship-2015/?do=findComment&comment=1753669","commentId":1753669,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1440495201,"content":"What madness has fallen upon you!

He sold out Eowyn to Grima. This Istari has no respect whatsoever for the women of Middle-earth, and he shows none for Arwen in a series of scathing ad hominem attacks projected in wizard voice from the pinnacle of Orthanc. Honey-on-the-tongue but venom in voice, Saruman's spite drives Arwen into the West.\n\nAK - Gimli. Dwarf v. Elf in an arm-wrestling match sparked by a minor disagreement over a blindfold.

Elrond may be the Master of the House, but Bofur is master of the tag-team.

Muttering about all this *&%^ anime nonsense, Elrond declares he has better things to do and heads off to do some research (in the discard pile).\n\nAM - Treebeard. The lead ranger may be one of the noblest of the faithful line of Stewards, but Treebeard is a hero masked as an ally. He is neutral only because he perfectly blends the four spheres and the four basic functionalities -- he has strong leadership (rallying the reclusive ents to march to war), he has strong tactics (tearing apart Isengard with his bare hands), he has strong spirit (rising to the occassion despite three ages of accumulated griefs and the fading of his people), and strong lore (his memory is literally the oldest, with the possible exception of Tom Bombadil).\n\nAN - Legolas. Somebody has to keep count with Gimli, and after Haldir's embarassing route in the arm-wrestling fiasco, Legolas steps up to the plate.
