I would say that setup instructions for first part of the quest will say look for smaug the magnificent and place it in staging area. And as you progress with quest the setup instructions will say swap it for smaug the mighty (or whatever is that card called) and last one you will swap it for smaug the terrible and the goal will be obvious protect lake-town and slay smaug.

You also have the burn mechanic where the town will burn through treacheries and each location has a \"Burn X\" where that is how much damage Lake Town will receive if you are told to resolve all Burn damage. You do have ways of healing Lake Town in the 2nd stage and Smaug can only take so much damage throughout the quest (max of 6 damage in stage 1 and 12 damage in stage 2, so you can't just kill him at the beginning). Also you have the Old Thrush Objective card that can help reduce Smaug's defense. You will also use the location's victory points to heal Lake Town as well.
