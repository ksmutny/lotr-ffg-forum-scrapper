(Max 1 at a time)  The general rule is:- Any progress made to the quest must first be placed on the 'Active' location, but any excess then goes onto the quest.  There are ways of getting progress on staging area locations, but successful questing progress is only made to the 'Active' location if any and the quest.  Cheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62551-questing-fase/?do=findComment&comment=612286","commentId":612286,"userName":"laiyna","timestamp":1333263336,"content":"just to be sure:\n\n \n\nbut the sum of progress on the quest and location  can never be more then total amount you positive quest (eg quest - threat)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62551-questing-fase/?do=findComment&comment=612335","commentId":612335,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1333279780,"content":"yes, it can never be more than quest - threat\n\n \n\nso if you quest with 10 will power and there is 5 threat in the staging area- it will always be most 5 progress tokens you are placing\n\nnote- as said, locations are dealt with quite separatly UNTIL they become the active loction, then they act as a buffer to the quest cards on THE NEXT TURN\n\n \n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62551-questing-fase/?do=findComment&comment=612350","commentId":612350,"userName":"laiyna","timestamp":1333283520,"content":"3  cheers, atlast clear for me, thanks rich :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62551-questing-fase/?do=findComment&comment=612351","commentId":612351,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1333283704,"content":"laiyna said:\n\n3  cheers, atlast clear for me, thanks rich :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n\n\n \n\nno worries laiyna happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"}]}
