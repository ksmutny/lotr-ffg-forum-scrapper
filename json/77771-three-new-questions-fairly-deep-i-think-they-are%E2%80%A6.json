Or we just ignore the left quest tokens?\n\n \n\n3. Mountain Warg; When dealt a shadow card with no effect, return it to staging area.\n\nMy question is: what does this \"no effect\" mean?\n\na. \"no effect\" = non shadow cards\n\nb.  it is a shadow card but does not resolve successfully, for example:\" Shadow: if undefended….\" but it is defended, so the effect does not affect the defending player\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77771-three-new-questions-fairly-deep-i-think-they-are%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=750399","commentId":750399,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1358634002,"content":"1) Gondorian Spearman's ability is a \"Response.\"  That means you may trigger it only at the moment that its conditions are met.  So you may deal 1 damage to an enemy at the moment that you declare the Spearman as a defender, and not later.  To be specific, that means it will be resolved after step 2 of attack resolution, but before step 3 (steps of attack resolution are on pg. 18 in the manual).\n\n2) Perilous Swamp says \"No more than 1 progress token can be placed on Perilous Swamp each round.\"  You can only place one progress token on this location during a given round; once you place the 2nd progress token on the location, you are free to place any remaining tokens on the current quest card.\n\n3) I believe this means there must be no printed shadow effect.  If the card has no printed shadow effect, return the Warg to the staging area after it attacks.  If there is a printed shadow effect, the Warg will remain engaged with that player, even if the effect is canceled.  \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77771-three-new-questions-fairly-deep-i-think-they-are%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=750415","commentId":750415,"userName":"Cutievalkyrie","timestamp":1358635814,"content":"Thank you. 2) and 3) are cleared.\n\nFor 1) do you mean the spearman only deal 1 damage after its attacked and survived or, we just exhaust him (to defend) and deal 1 damage immediately?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77771-three-new-questions-fairly-deep-i-think-they-are%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=750449","commentId":750449,"userName":"Cutievalkyrie","timestamp":1358639730,"content":"Now i totally understand.
