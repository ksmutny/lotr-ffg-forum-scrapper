Just don't feel as smooth and easy-to-use as lackey. Very clunky. End the updates are even more rare than the ones for lackey and the LotR plugin. I would suggest following the lackey plugin update on the cardgamedb site. Just go to the LotR forum and you will find the lackey thread easy. Tragic also explains how you can update the plugin yourself if you want to. Really easy. Can also recommend CardWarden for iPad."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196924-lackeyccg-plugin/?do=findComment&comment=2017260","commentId":2017260,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1453934835,"content":"It really comes down to taste as I've always preferred OCTGN's interface over Lackey's. Anyway, the main difference between the two is that OCTGN is consistently updated. It is currently up to date on both the Saga's and up through The Dread Realm."}]}
