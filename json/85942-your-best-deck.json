It doesn't have to be \"best\" as in being able to beat the most quests, if it's a thematic deck that you really enjoy playing, then go ahead and share it. If it can beat every quest with ease, I also urge you to share it, as I'm sure we'd all be fascinated. Just as an example, since I'm writing this quickly, I really enjoy playing with the Gondor deck that FFG posted a while ago in Second Breakfast:\n\n \nHeroes\nBoromir (Heirs of Númenor, 2)\nAragorn (Core Set, 1)\nBeregond (Heirs of Númenor, 1)\n \nAllies\nCitadel Custodian x3 \nDefender of Rammas x3 \nErrand-rider x3 \nEnvoy of Pelargir x3 \nFaramir x2\nGandalf (Core Set, 73) x3\nGondorian Spearman x3\nGuard of the Citadel x3\n \nAttachments\nCelebrían’s Stone x1\nCitadel Plate x1 \nGondorian Shield (The Steward’s Fear, 5) x3 \nHorn of Gondor x1 \nSpear of the Citadel x3 \nSteward of Gondor x2 \nSword that was Broken (The Watcher in the Water, 55) x2\n \nEvents\nBehind Strong Walls x3 \nEver Vigilant x2 \nGoblin-cleaver (The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill, 16) x2\nSneak Attack x2 \nValiant Sacrifice x2\nWealth of Gondor x3\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85942-your-best-deck/?do=findComment&comment=809525","commentId":809525,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1373191058,"content":"This is my Spirit Tactics Deck. It's one of the decks I enjoy playing the most (because it's fun and because you can defeat pretty much every scenario maybe except the battle of laketown and escape from dol guldur). Since the silvan tracker was released it has become really powerful. So this is the standard version (I generally swap a few cards for every different scenario even though this is one of the decks that needs that the least) but you might add shadow of the past instead of horn of gondor, or eagles (if you need to play against battle/siege sceanrios) instead of 1 dwarven tomb, 1 west road traveller and other 3x cards. The strategy is easy but it can be tricky because you're not always supposed to play every card as you draw it (in fact you need to save some resources in the early turns if you can). If you have at least one weapon and foe hammer you'll very likely draw 3+ cards every turn, you'll need the dwarven tomb to fetch elrond's counsel from the discard pile (or a test of will if you feel treachery cards can be your doom). You have a lot of willpower almost always from turn one (cause you can get a silvan tracker and an envoy of pelargir) + hama and glorfindel you'll have 7 WP (and legolas that progress while killing). when you get Gandalf out all you have to do if beware of your theat. the rest will be up to him (especially defense). Attack is one of this deck's best feat, as you'll be a real orc slayer (with 3 blade of gondolin) but you'll deal a good amount of damage to anyone (3 atk heroes + gandalf + rivendell blade x2 + 6 1 atk allies...and black arrow deals the final blow to any boss). The deck is very cheap (only 2, 1 and 0 cost cards except for gandalf). try it out if you like.\n\n \n\n \n\nSpirit Tactics  - Solo\n\n \n\nHero (3)\n\nLegolas (Core) x1\n\nHama (TLD) x1\n\nGlorfindel (FoS) x1\n\n \n\n \n\nAlly (17)\n\nGandalf (OHaUH) x3\n\nArwen Undomiel (TWitW) x2\n\nDefender of Rammas (HON) x3\n\nWest Road Traveller (RtM) x3\n\nEnvoy of Pelargir (HON) x3\n\nSilvan Refugee (TDF) x3\n\n \n\n \n\nAttachment (17)\n\nHorn of Gondor (Core) x2\n\nLight of Valinor (FoS) x3\n\nBlack Arrow (OtD) x1\n\nBlade of Gondolin (Core) x3\n\nRivendell Blade (RtR) x2\n\nAncient Mathom (AJtR) x3\n\nSong of Travel (THoEM) x3\n\n \n\n \n\nEvent (20)\n\nFeint (Core) x3\n\nHands Upon the Bow (SaF) x3\n\nA Test of Will (Core) x3\n\nDwarven Tomb (Core) x3\n\nFoe-hammer (OHaUH) x3\n\nElrond's Counsel (TWitW) x3\n\nStand and Fight (Core) x2\n\nEdited July 7, 2013 by DevastazioneH88"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85942-your-best-deck/?do=findComment&comment=809555","commentId":809555,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373201706,"content":"i have 3. the first is the one i am most famous for and my favourite thematically. it changes often so there will be more cards than usual, but here is the general idea..\n\n \n\nThe Flight To the Ford\n\n \n\nStrider (lore)\n\nFrodo\n\nGlorfindel (spirit)\n\n \n\nstargazer\n\ngildor\n\nmirkwood runners\n\nriversong\n\narwen\n\nnorthern tracker\n\nhaldir\n\n \n\nasfaloth\n\nlight of valinor\n\ngood meal\n\nfast hitch\n\nburning brand (if not hasty stroke)\n\nmathom\n\nranger spikes\n\nsong of wisdom\n\n \n\nstriders path\n\ntest of will\n\nhasty stroke (if no brand)\n\nelronds counsel\n\ndwarven tomb\n\ndearons runes\n\no elbereth gilthoniel\n\n \n\ngeneral idea is using frodo s ability with glorfindels low start threat and striders threat reset. generally its a theme deck but i (and others) have had good use with it in solo. its also a great paired deck with a tactics killing deck.\n\n \n\nthe 2nd is my killing deck. again cards will change...this is just off the top of my head\n\n \n\nunnamed\n\n \n\nHama / Beorn / Legolas\n\n \n\nvassel\n\nwinged guardian\n\neagles of misty mountains\n\nwatcher of the bruinen\n\ntrollshaw scout\n\nbofur tactics\n\n \n\nsupport of the eagles\n\nrivendell/gondolin blades\n\nyew bow\n\nblack arrows\n\nrivendell bow\n\n \n\nfeint\n\nthicket of spears\n\nstraight shot\n\ngoblin cleaver\n\nfoe hammer\n\nquick strike\n\nhands upon the bow\n\n \n\nstrategy is keep hama recycling feint/thicket. beorn sentinels another questing decks enemies and some of the weaker ones that cannot be feinted. legolas hits across the table and hama helps with other enemies.\n\n \n\n3rd one is one i posted last night about winning the stewards fear....im proud to say me and a friend got an old style score of -3 on the quest.\n\n \n\nThe Alliance\n\n \n\ntheodred\n\nglorfindel\n\nbifur\n\n \n\ngildor\n\nerestor\n\narwen\n\nriversong\n\nnorthern tracker\n\ngleowine\n\nfaramir\n\ngandalf\n\nelfhelm\n\n \n\nresourceful\n\nsteward\n\nasfaloth\n\nlight of valinor\n\n \n\nrisk some light\n\ntest of will\n\ntomb\n\ndearons runes\n\nwealth of lorien\n\nelronds counsel\n\nwill of the west\n\nsneak attack\n\ntimely aid\n\nEdited July 7, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85942-your-best-deck/?do=findComment&comment=809595","commentId":809595,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1373208679,"content":"@Rich - You made up the Flight to the Ford deck?
