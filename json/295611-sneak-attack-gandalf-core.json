A question just to be sure i understnad it...\n\nSneak Attack + Gandalf (core) can be played during Quest phase in the Commit characters action window? I mean...could we play events in that window? So that i will be able to commit Gandalf to the quest? I assume that after Staging if we play Sneak Attack + Gandalf (core)..we cannot commit Gandalf to the quest..right?\n\nWhen exactly can we play Sneak Attack + Gandalf (core)...to be able he is commited to quest ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295611-sneak-attack-gandalf-core/?do=findComment&comment=3708068","commentId":3708068,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1558697474,"content":"Yes, just Play the combo in the action window before committing characters to the quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295611-sneak-attack-gandalf-core/?do=findComment&comment=3708070","commentId":3708070,"userName":"bitzurock","timestamp":1558697703,"content":"http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#RoundSequence [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#RoundSequence]\n\nAre you talking about the Quest phase Step 1 - Commit characters window?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295611-sneak-attack-gandalf-core/?do=findComment&comment=3708136","commentId":3708136,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1558706051,"content":"If you play Sneak Attack - Gandalf before you commit characters, yes, I can commit to the quest as well.\n\nIf you do it after staging, then no he cannot commit to the quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295611-sneak-attack-gandalf-core/?do=findComment&comment=3708295","commentId":3708295,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1558721427,"content":"Take a look at the post above"}]}
