I know I need to get some sort of expansion for the core game, but which one? Some players say to go in order, but for the life of me, I can't figure out what that is. Could you help me out on what I am supposed to get besides the initial game? Many thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75249-please-help-a-muddled-mum/?do=findComment&comment=731353","commentId":731353,"userName":"pak1421","timestamp":1354891471,"content":"Never mind.
