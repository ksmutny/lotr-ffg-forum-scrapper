This helps protect against unforeseen deaths from nasty shadow effects boosting enemy attack. It also helps provide protection for allies with 1 hitpoint especially against nasty treachery effects that damage multiple characters. These allies can now be saved from these effects and that single point of damage.\n\nTerrible to Behold is great with trap decks forcing a nasty enemy back into the staging area and straight into a trap like ranger spikes, ithilien pit etc. You can stop an especially nasty enemy from attacking then place it back into the staging area so you can destroy it next turn using Ride them Down. I still think that Terrible to Behold is best used in tandem with Tactigorn or a deck that focuses on staging area attack.\n\nEdited September 21, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230535-the-corsairs-of-umbar/?do=findComment&comment=2423584","commentId":2423584,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1474423954,"content":">  \n> \n> > Just makes me want City of the Corsairs more and, inexplicably, Outlands Imrahil.\n> \n> yeah, i'm glad to see new Outlands support is making people give Outlands another chance.\n> \n>  \n> \n> i think when people cried 'it makes the game too easy!' before what they really meant was that it made deckbuilding easy (or rather, that it didn't give a lot of interesting choices and/or streamlined the process by including pretty much all Outlands cards and then deciding if you really wanted Hunter of Lamedon or not)\n> \n> but this new Imrahil hero and Imrahil attachment are nice.  Tactics or Leadership Imrahil?  if Tactics, what are you going to add?  or maybe even go Spirit with the new Imrahil ally...  it opened up a lot of the deckbuilding space i think, which makes it a bit more engaging.\n> \n>  \n> \n> > Nyashish.\n> \n> Na'asiyah\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nHirluin, Faramir and Imrahil Mono Leadership Outlands deck for the win!\n\n \n\nYeah, I think Prince will be better on Leadership Imrahil, or at least easier and less janky."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230535-the-corsairs-of-umbar/?do=findComment&comment=2423585","commentId":2423585,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1474423996,"content":"All of these references to the Grey Company in the article make me hopeful for Elladan + Elrohir allies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230535-the-corsairs-of-umbar/?do=findComment&comment=2423600","commentId":2423600,"userName":"dr00","timestamp":1474425108,"content":"> Both of these cards feel a little too expensive to me.

That's 9 resources and and a 3-card combo though, and those really aren't things that Tactics can do on its own.\n\ni think Vigilant Guard is basically reads: 'attach to Tactics Gimli'\n\nit's really nice for him to help build up his power in a less risky way. it could be too expensive, as you say, but it does also provide 2 extra hit points, so for Gimli: it's a 3-cost, +2 attack card that also helps you build up his attack in a more controlled way\n\ni can't think of anything else that would be super helpful otherwise. spreading the damage around in a way to prevent characters from dying, but i agree. it's really expensive in that regard.\n\nalso about Terrible to Behold: it's a Tactics effect in Leadership. it's not going to be as good. look at Quick Ears [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Quick-Ears-TBoCD] or Expert Trackers [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Expert-Trackers-TLR], which are not normally Lore abilities, but not as good as their counterparts.\n\nit gives more options for a Leadership/Tactics deck, but i think this fits into a Leadership deck that doesn't have access to Feint. it also helps Dunhere, if such a Rohan deck could be made (Rohan has quite a few options with Leadership, and there are plenty of nobles, so i could see this working there). and it's cheaper than A Light in the Dark*\n\n*if you don't need your noble's action for anything else\n\n\n\n> Hirluin, Faramir and Imrahil Mono Leadership Outlands deck for the win!\n> \n>  \n> \n> Yeah, I think Prince will be better on Leadership Imrahil, or at least easier and less janky.\n\nyeah, i've been rocking a Hirluin, Denethor, Hirluin mono Leadership, and i think i'll end up replacing Denethor with Leadership Imrahil\n\ni also tried Erestor, based on someone's posted deck, and that extra card draw is pretty awesome. it might make Tactics Imrahil worth considering, but Lord of Morthond is just so awesome!\n\nEdited September 21, 2016 by dr00"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230535-the-corsairs-of-umbar/?do=findComment&comment=2423623","commentId":2423623,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1474426162,"content":"Denethor is another good one too. But I like the lineup I mentioned, feels very thematic but not in a forced way. Sure, you could exploit Faramir better in another deck, but with how huge the Outlanders get, just readying an ally whenever you engage an enemy is pretty good. And of course, with Imrahil you get another Outlands hero, which gives a great new spin to the deck. Maybe you won't be using his ability that often because you don't want your allies to die, but with like x3 Sneak Attack, x3 Gandalf and x3 Tome of Atanatar, you're gonna use it for sure.

Is the response effect that much better than sentinel to warrant that extra resource in the cost. I personally don't think it is especially when we have Song of Mocking which has a very similar effect for one tactics resource.\n> \n> That being said it is a decent card in the right deck. It is obviously the sort of card you want to run in combo with Gloin or Gimli but again Song of Mocking can do the same thing for less. It is probably alot better on Gimli as it gives him extra hitpoints without taking up a restricted slot like Citadel Plate. This way you can put other useful attachments on him instead. Its still pretty great on Gloin as well though. Outside these two heroes the only other decent use I can think of is Boromir ally who already costs 4 on his own (so it would cost 7 to get this attached to him which is a quite a lot especially for tactics...). A little bit too niche for my liking. I guess one other thing you could do with it is attach it to a warrior character with a decent amount of hitpoints so that they can take the first point of damage dealt to your main defender a few times to keep damage off your defender.

It is obviously the sort of card you want to run in combo with Gloin or Gimli but again Song of Mocking can do the same thing for less. It is probably alot better on Gimli as it gives him extra hitpoints without taking up a restricted slot like Citadel Plate. This way you can put other useful attachments on him instead. Its still pretty great on Gloin as well though. Outside these two heroes the only other decent use I can think of is Boromir ally who already costs 4 on his own (so it would cost 7 to get this attached to him which is a quite a lot especially for tactics...).
