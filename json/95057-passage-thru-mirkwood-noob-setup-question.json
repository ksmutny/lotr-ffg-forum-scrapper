From my read of the forums, it sounds like one mistake was choosing tactics, but I also have a basic setup question. At the start, 1a says to add the Forest Spider and the Old Forest Road to the staging area. Does this count as the two cards from the encounter deck for the first round or should there be two more cards added to the staging area during the questing phase?\n\nThanks for help with this stupid question?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95057-passage-thru-mirkwood-noob-setup-question/?do=findComment&comment=929088","commentId":929088,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1386867752,"content":"There should be added two more cards in the quest phase.\n\n \n\nIf you have only the Core set, mono tactics is a no go...
