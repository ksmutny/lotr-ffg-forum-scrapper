I know that I will be drawing five cards every round, and that ciridan demands that one be discarded, but how do I choose which one that is? Do I declare that I first draw cards from erestor, and then from ciridan, choosing between the fourth and fifth to discard one, or do I choose a ciridan discard card from all cards I drew, saying that all the bonus card draw resolves at onwe, and that I don’t know which were drawn due to ciridan? The second one seems kind of OP, so I’m leaning towards the first scenario, but I may be wrong. Thanks in advance for the help. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281873-ciridan-and-erestor-card-draw/?do=findComment&comment=3456805","commentId":3456805,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1535734326,"content":"Cirdan and Erestor both have a passive effect that alters the number of cards drawn at the beginning of the resource phase.  So you would draw five cards.  Then Cirdan's forced effect would kick in, and you would have to discard one of the five cards you drew."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281873-ciridan-and-erestor-card-draw/?do=findComment&comment=3457156","commentId":3457156,"userName":"Mostly_Harmless_Species","timestamp":1535753307,"content":"> 5 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> you would have to discard one of the five cards you drew.\n\nOk, thanks.
