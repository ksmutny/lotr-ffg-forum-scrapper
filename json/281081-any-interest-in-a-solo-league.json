The sum of your Favor of the Valar for three quests represents your \"score\" for the league, with lower being better.\n\nHere's the variant in a nutshell, ignoring the campaign component -- you start each quest with no tokens. If you lose, you get an additional token, two tokens if you lose in the first five turns. (Actually, since the tokens are used for score, take as many as you want after each loss...) For each token you have at the beginning of the quest, you choose to draw a card or give one of your heroes a resource. Eventually you'll overpower *any* quest this way, no matter how bad your deck is. (OK, unless you're running Erestor against The Road to Isengard -- don't do that). So everyone's a winner, it's just a question of how much help the Valar had to give you....\n\nRationale -- I don't like the official scoring system at all, and win/loss is too coarsely grained to be much use for assigning a winner.

So the scoring is the number of tokens you ended up actually taking but the tiebreaker is the number of actual attempts it took.\n\nIt sounds like a nice idea, but I suspect that would actually have the effect of making the Grace of the Valar tokens irrelevant.\n\nUnder these proposed rules, whenever you lose a quest, you have to make a choice: Do I take the token, or not? If you think there's any chance that your deck can beat the quest as-is, you should always forego the token--because if you can get to the end with zero tokens (no matter how many tries it took!) you'll always beat out someone who took any tokens at all.\n\nAt worst, this could advantage someone with a mediocre deck but more time on their hands over someone with a fairly consistent deck but less free time to wait for a perfect score. In practice, I think it just reduces the tournament down to \"number of retries\" and effectively removes the Grace of the Valar stuff from the game altogether.\n\nSlightly more interesting might be to allow you to forego spending your GotV tokens, and use \"number of tokens spent\" as the tiebreaker. You'd have to track two separate numbers, but at least it creates an interesting decision around \"do I think spending this token now will be the difference between me winning versus losing this game\"?\n\nBut honestly I prefer the simplicity of the rules-as-written. It reduces the amount of time investment required to participate and keeps the focus on the individual games of LotR rather than the meta-game that surrounds them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281081-any-interest-in-a-solo-league/?do=findComment&comment=3445739","commentId":3445739,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1534713191,"content":"I haven't thought of that. I imagine it as a tiebreaker who come after the \"number of game you lose\", even if valor grace was supposed to represent that.
