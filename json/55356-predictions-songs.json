These cards give options.....whole deckbuilding options.\n\nI imagine at some point we will see heroes in the future that actually have 2 resource icons to start. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55356-predictions-songs/?do=findComment&comment=547757","commentId":547757,"userName":"Beast Rabban","timestamp":1319661216,"content":"Songs being powerful is not a prediction its a fact.\n\nI like your second prediction of a multi-sphere character.

If he appears, he'll likely be an objective though.\n\nOff topic, how about Prancing Pony as a location, spend 1 resource from a hero's resource pool to ready that hero (while the location is active)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55356-predictions-songs/?do=findComment&comment=548422","commentId":548422,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1319798593,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\nOff topic, how about Prancing Pony as a location, spend 1 resource from a hero's resource pool to ready that hero (while the location is active).\n\n\n\nIf there's ever an adventure set in Breeland, I think that would be a great location."}]}
