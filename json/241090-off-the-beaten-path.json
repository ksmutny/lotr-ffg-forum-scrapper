Scrying, avoiding surge, and avoiding treacheries for a round is crazy good, and all of these are areas in which tactics was lacking up until now. I also like how you put the enemy immediately engaged, which means the enemy won't add its threat. Also, since all this is done at the very beginning of the quest phase, you also know exactly how much questing you need to make that round, without any nasty surprises awaiting. This is a card which Mablung and Amarthiúl love btw. Include Háma there too. Mostly, I specially like how this card can be seen as treachery cancellation. Wait no Longer should be an auto-include for any deck with access to tactics and proud to be good at handling enemies.\n\nEdited January 27, 2017 by Rajam"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241090-off-the-beaten-path/?do=findComment&comment=2613218","commentId":2613218,"userName":"xchan","timestamp":1485580660,"content":"I hate to be that guy, but I'm really scared about the Harradim cycle being the last one now.
