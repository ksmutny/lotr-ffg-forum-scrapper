My question is how many cards am I supposed to have in each sphere deck? I separated them all out and I have 33 cards per deck. This includes the gandalf for each one and the 3 heros. Just wondering if that's the correct amount. I don't find anywhere in the rules, like usual, that states, ok now you should have this many in this deck Ect. I guess I'm asking because in some of the tutorials it appears they have more cards than that, but that could be because they are sleeved as well. I think I got everything else separated well for my first scenario. Took all the 3 different cards that show same emblems as scenario cards out for encounter deck, and have all 4 cards for scenario. So i think I'm good. The preconstructed core decks just feel a little lite. Thanks again and I can't wait to get my first solo questing underway!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97495-cards-in-decks-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=960195","commentId":960195,"userName":"Spurries","timestamp":1390309389,"content":"With just the core set staying mono-sphere with 30 or 33 is completely fine IMO.  It is mentioned in the rulebook that 'tournament' decks use a minimum of 50.  You can certainly try making a dual-sphere deck with 50 cards, but until you start adding adventure packs/expansions its tough to get a good 50 card deck.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97495-cards-in-decks-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=960279","commentId":960279,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1390315338,"content":"I thought there were 40 per sphere in the core..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97495-cards-in-decks-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=960363","commentId":960363,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1390319402,"content":"Nope. 30 or 33 depending on the Gandalves."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97495-cards-in-decks-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=960423","commentId":960423,"userName":"la1cajun","timestamp":1390321775,"content":"I have exactly 33 for each deck, including the 3 heroes and 1 gandalf.

And minimum deck size must be 50.

If it makes you feel better, it could be much worse. I've always wanted to expand beyond the Game of Thrones Core Set, but don't fancy dropping a grand to collect everything."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97495-cards-in-decks-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=961688","commentId":961688,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1390423390,"content":"Regarding the expense of the game, I really feel as though I've received my money's worth.  I recently totaled up everything I've spent on LOTR LCG and it came out less than a single tier 1 MtG deck.  So it's very reasonable after all.  But I hear you.  I'm thinking of branching into CoC or aGoT and I feel SO behind that it's a little daunting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97495-cards-in-decks-for-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=962027","commentId":962027,"userName":"la1cajun","timestamp":1390453132,"content":"I hear ya on the mtg. I played that for awhile, and still have a few decks made my buddy and I can get a quick game in at lunch usually. You can drop a load of cash on those cards.

And Khazad-Dum if you want the Dwarrowdelf.  "}]}
