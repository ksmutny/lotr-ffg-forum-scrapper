Want to play a Silvan Tracker but worried you might need that Marksman in your hand this turn instead? Wait for the reveal, and if you don't need to shore up your attack power, go ahead and play the Tracker instead. Such flexibility should not be underestimated."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290724-thanduil-what-am-i-missing/?do=findComment&comment=3619973","commentId":3619973,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1549833574,"content":"Yes, the delay is a great point, too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290724-thanduil-what-am-i-missing/?do=findComment&comment=3620198","commentId":3620198,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1549853135,"content":"Galadriel is great synergy in a Silvan deck but she doesn't define the archetype--- so \"not synergizing with Galadriel\" is not a strike against Thranduil, in my book.  If anything, I like it because it encourages different decks to be built, rather than everyone building the same tri-sphere Silvan deck over and over.  I haven't had a chance to play Thranduil yet but I like him very much.

However, I find you do not want too many attachments in this deck filled with allies, and you already have O Lorien, Mirror of Galadriel and perhaps Nenya, all of which you might want three copies of (I was only playing one of Nenya when I had a Lore hero but now with Thranduil I run three copies).

For that matter, Celeborn is also not a bad candidate, more than he can be flexible with attack. What really helps though, is to have Woodland Archer ready and thanks to Thranduil be able to play him in combat: I just find that combo amazing."}]}
