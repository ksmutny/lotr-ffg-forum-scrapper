I think if staging was supposed to be completed, it would have stated more along the lines of \"don't resolve the quest after staging\". I think thematically it makes more sense to just end it too; if you know that you're following a false lead, you're not going to keep poking into whatever cranies that are revealing these enemies and locations.\n\n \n\nI do wish the card was worded more precisely. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84499-false-lead-stewards-fear/?do=findComment&comment=800449","commentId":800449,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1369941366,"content":"got an official answer\n\nFalse Lead ends the quest phase when it is revealed.

In the next turn during the preparation phase, you reveal the cards from the encounter deck and add them to the staging area. 20 menace were already there, now you add 20 (the cards already there whose menace you count again) + the menace from the new cards revealed, say 9. So you end up with 49 menace you have to resolve in questing. \n\n \n\nYesterday we played it like that - and lost.\n\n \n\nI wonder if we did wrong?
