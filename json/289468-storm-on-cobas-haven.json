Really struggling to beat this quest. I've seen the pippin sailing deck in rings DB and am trying to hold off from using it. However I have a question regarding the Dol Amroth objectives. And the guarding card effects of Battle in the Bay side 2a and the Heavy Cruiser: can an enemy or location guard more than one objective? This is cropping up in every run through of this game and I'm thinking the answer is yes.\n\n \n\nAlso if the Raider Flag ship ends up guarding the Beacon is it pretty much game over without having the extra warships already in play?  \n\nEdited January 19, 2019 by asgardianphil"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289468-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=3597496","commentId":3597496,"userName":"player1683311","timestamp":1547929357,"content":"I haven't played it in a while. I found the best solution was a dwarf swarm deck with Dain. You have plenty of hands to run your ship, Erebor battle masters for combat, and questers.\n\nI used the tower to reduce archery, and I always used narylenya (spelling, the ship that reduces cost of allies).  Usually I use erestor swarming decks for sailing but the ones I built didn't have enough combat for this quest. \n\nWhatever you do you need lots of allies. Getting the warships is awesome, although not always necessary. One reason this quest is so great is that you have to change your strategy as different things can happen.\n\nGood luck"}]}
