I concede the point. Single card releases would not be its downfall. I would be the first in line for them. However, i don't think the game would benefit from single card releases.

I found a site in Austria just before xmas that sells cards singly for A Game of Thrones (didn't think to check for this game), and some of them were quite pricy. I was primarily shopping for the odd single to boost out the Time of Ravens cycle, and spent €25 or so to get quite a decent array, but there were the odd one or two that were €4 or more each, which is just too expensive for me! I've been known to pay nearly $4 for Star Wars TCG cards before now, but no more!\n\nRecently, though, I've been considering buying a second core set, of course one of the major draws to this being getting a second copy of the I think 6 cards that there are only one of in the core set, but also a big reason has been to get a second copy of the encounter deck cards. I am a very lazy gamer, and feel that I don't play this game as much as I could do because it takes time to set up everything - the player deck needs to be built, the encounter deck needs to be built, etc. So if I had some encounter decks made up already, and my current deck kept in the box as well, it would be a lot less hassle to get it out and play. I think I worked out that, by buying an extra core set, I could have three of the Mirkwood adventures set up permanently, to be played with at the drop of a hat. I can't remember exactly, but I'm sure the last two adventures were there, at least.\n\nSo the only thing currently stopping me doing this is the fact that there would be 12 useless hero duplicates, all the quests, and a lot of cards that I already have three of. I suppose if there could be brought in a rule for duplicate cards similar to that in AGoT for saving your guy from dying, maybe the additional hero cards could come in handy also.\n\nThe moral of this highly fascinating tale, anyway, is that I am beginning to see a certain wisdom in buying a second core set..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59281-regarding-the-dark-art-of-singles/?do=findComment&comment=582617","commentId":582617,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1327127193,"content":"Oh, and -\n\nCaptain Poe said:\n\nBefore this game I played MtG and star wars minis.
