This Gandalf deck is too powerful. The next nightmare I will do is Journey Along the Anduin. But I believe it will be too easy again. I am going to make a new deck after that, because Gandalf is just so powerful and broken, even more so than the Outlands. Outlands can easily die to treacheries, but Gandalf and Elrond are almost indestructible.\n\n \n\nAnd sorry to bore you, Glaurung. I really like your videos by the way. You inspired me to make mine. Keep yours coming!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125591-gwaihirs-video-play-throughnightmare-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=1312567","commentId":1312567,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1414377043,"content":"Hmmm jorney down to Anduin is tricky. Maybe it will be not easy at all. I would like to see how you manage it. I would like to see also the second cycle nightmare quest if you dont mind.\n\nI like your videos, you are good player. Keep it on!"}]}
