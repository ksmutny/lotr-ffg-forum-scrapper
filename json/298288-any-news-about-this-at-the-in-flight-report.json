That said, I don't think that we've had anything from there for the last few years.\n\nWe certainly have another cycle on the way, though.  The new deluxe released today, and the first pack of the cycle has already been announced.\n\nAnd given the account of turnaround time it takes for a cycle to go from planning to release, I expect there's at least another cycle in the game after this.\n\nHonestly, though, if this does turn out to be the last cycle, the game is in a good place for it.\n\n(Also, there's still a bunch of nightmare stuff left to make, so we have product for quite some time.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298288-any-news-about-this-at-the-in-flight-report/?do=findComment&comment=3753716","commentId":3753716,"userName":"Freeman","timestamp":1564735966,"content":"> 4 hours ago, rbaker1978 said:\n> \n> I'm afraid I can already guess the answer.

Instead of creating a mini \"store\" in the center of their area, with shelves and peghooks of product, they distributed catalogs of product to those in line and took orders at the register. An associate would then go behind the curtain and come back with the required product.\n\nThere are pros and cons with this system, but I mention it here because there was no product offered for the LotR LCG. I was disappointed, as I was hoping to pick up a couple blister packs that I have not been able to find through an online retailer. I assume the reason has to do with limited space and the necessity to prioritize the new hotness. It still sends a message that FFG doesn't consider LotR as important a part of their overall games portfolio as they once did.\n\nDoes anyone know when the FFG license to make boardgames for LotR expires? I doubt they would have created Journies of it was close to expiring, but it could indicate just how close to sunset the LCG might be. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298288-any-news-about-this-at-the-in-flight-report/?do=findComment&comment=3756534","commentId":3756534,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1565039847,"content":"That's strange!
