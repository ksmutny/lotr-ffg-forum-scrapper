I'm happy this format is so fun cooperatively, too. I'll post my \"decks\" one at a time so as to avoid walls of text.\n\n \n\nLocation Lock deck:     Quest stages are A Fork in the Road and the Sorcerer's Tower\n\n1 Ravenous Spider\n\n1 Spider of Dol Guldur  These two spiders are here to provide some sort of boss enemy as the players focus on locations. They were the ones that mesh with the general strategy the best.\n\n2 Dark Bats\n\n3 Eastern Crows\n\n2 Forest Flies  These help to generate more locations and provide a little combat as well\n\n1 Goblin Sniper  Another card to lock up the staging area. Tough to deal with as well\n\n2 Forest Stream\n\n3 Pine Slopes\n\n1 Twilight Hall\n\n2 Oak-Wood Grove\n\n1 Sorcerer's Tower   All of these are staple locations in a deck like this\n\n1 Patch of Midnight   Adds to complexity of locations and confuses the players\n\n1 Hunter's Lookout\n\n2 Pitch-Dark Thickets\n\n2 Necromancer's Pass     these last three round out the suite of locations\n\n2 Under the Shadow\n\n2 Nightfall\n\n1 Power Sevenfold     Just lots of general nastiness\n\n1 Treacherous Fog\n\n1 Fastness of Mirkwood   These can wreck the players in a location lock deck\n\n3 Eyes in the Dark\n\n1 Weighed Down    To round out the deck\n\n \n\nWhat do you think? And what do you think about the format in general? Will RingsDB integrate this format? Will FFG provide organized play?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280428-wizards-quest-strategies/?do=findComment&comment=3429990","commentId":3429990,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1533506433,"content":"Here's a boss enemy deck.
