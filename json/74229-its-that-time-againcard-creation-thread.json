Piece of cake.\n\nKey to the Armoury, should need to discard a card to use it, or discard itself. Also is a candidate for a 1per deck limit. Card searching cards have proven too powerfull in every card game, and they should be very limited in their use.

Feint still does a better job though.\n\nThere was this discussion before, and not just once, of how Tactics is poor for solo play. Lately I was trying a mono-Tactics deck for coop games, and it has been working rather very well. Then I took it solo on the Passage through Mirkwood, likely the easiest quest out there. I got roasted on the first try and I hardly won on the second, largely due to a proxy of Trained for War. I find it quite extreme that after so many cards have been released, Tactics is still totally clumsy on its own. Just imagine a mono-Spirit deck cruising through such a quest (and many) with say Glorfindel, Frodo, Éowyn on board. I don't think I would lose more than one game out of 100 against the Passage through Mirkwood with such a deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74229-its-that-time-againcard-creation-thread/?do=findComment&comment=723233","commentId":723233,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1352867675,"content":"Cmdrindie said:\n\n This is my first post, so please forgive me if this has already been posted/conjectured, or if I'm out of turn.
