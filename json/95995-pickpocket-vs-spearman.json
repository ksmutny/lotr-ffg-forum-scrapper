(Once the act of resolving an enemy’s attack begins, it is too late to prevent it from attacking with Feint.)\n\n \n\nThis would seem to indicate that once you declare an enemy as an attacker, it's attacking. I'd say that that satisfies the if/then statement inherent in the Pickpocket's forced reaction. It's not explicit, I guess, but the spirit of the thing is there."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95995-pickpocket-vs-spearman/?do=findComment&comment=949412","commentId":949412,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1389227333,"content":"Ok, cleared.
