And then I think TB will be among them, I don't get that Brand hate, sure the guy is not exactly handsome but he still looks much better than a vast majority of people I meet in the streets. Now that Bilbo is a bit scary though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65861-magali-does-them-all/?do=findComment&comment=643367","commentId":643367,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1339476976,"content":"love her art- wish theyd change it about more though"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65861-magali-does-them-all/?do=findComment&comment=643735","commentId":643735,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1339532443,"content":"muemakan said:\n\nWow, so far 4 out of 5 Heroes in this cycle come from Magali.

I can't imagine her ability has changed that vastly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65861-magali-does-them-all/?do=findComment&comment=643820","commentId":643820,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1339554360,"content":"No, Bilbo and Brand are by other artists."}]}
