But for bests:\n\n \n\nTactics I have to say I really struggle to get away from Gimli in tactics, I really rely on his huge attack. Gimli, hurt, with a weapon (Dwarrowdelf Axe) and citadel plate often seems my main way of dealing with the big health monsters.\n\nAs a result, I have hardly played any other tactics hero as my poor deck building just cant support them.\n\nId love to try others away from Gimli.\n\n \n\nSpirit its always Eowyn, shes just too good a questor for the money. I heavily rely on her too.\n\n \n\nLore: Dont often play lore but when I have, Denethor and his scrying has been the reason.\n\n \n\nLeadership: This is a tough one as Ive played a few Leadership heros. Dain is good for his dwarf buffing and then if he goes last he has some good stats too. Theodred is great for his cheap cost and his resource, Gloin I have enjoyed when partnered with a healer as his defending/resource in that mode works great, core Aragorn is good for stats and readying.... Hmmm.... I think for cost-to-gain I probably play Theodred most from those :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nGood thread, am interested in what will come into it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2374268","commentId":2374268,"userName":"CommanderDave","timestamp":1471602368,"content":"I'd actually agree on a a good number of your choices.

Low threat, 2 WP, moderate hp and an ability to save the game from deadly shadow effects!\n\n \n\n \n\nLORE:\n\nBeravor - Wingfoot on her gets you 2 WP each turn and someone gets to draw 2 additional cards each turn.  And card draw is king.\n\nTreebeard - Great for every phase of the game.  Self-preservation and Ent Draugh make this beast into a machine.  Lembas is also fantastic if you can swing it.\n\nElrond - great stats paired with resource matching and increased healing as well as access to Vilya.\n\n \n\nWORST:\n\nBombur, Faramir and Glorfindel - Of these three, I have only tried to use Faramir, but his high starting threat works directly against his desire to leave enemies in the staging area.\n\n \n\nNOTE: My personal favorite Lore heroes are Damrod and Haldir, but Damrod requires enemies that can be trapped and Haldir requires tactics weapons to be of any worth."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2375698","commentId":2375698,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1471653751,"content":"I've almost never used Treebeard hero in pure solo, but maybe I should give him a try (and forget about his ally version.... huh... what??)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2375719","commentId":2375719,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1471655031,"content":"No Háma in tactics?

She is great at the start to get you some cards and needed thread reduction and don't forget: Every ally you get into play will quest for free! So even if you play some chump like Envoy of Pelargir that ally will quest and get you a defense. So she is quite good for the early game to fend of early enemy attacks and let you establish your board presence AND she scales waaay better into the late game then Arwen does. It's a close call but I would give Galadriel the slight edge over Arwen.\n\n \n\nSo back to topic, for me the choices by sphere would be:\n\n \n\nLeadership:\n\nBest: 1st: Denethor 2nd: Armathiul 3rd: tie between Imrahil and Sam\n\nFirst two are simply the most used heroes in Leadership for me right now because you get soo much out of them. Denethor get's you resources very fast and spreads them just where you need them + he can defend if you manage to get him a shield. Armathiul + Armored Destrier + Captain of Gondor is a combat powerhouse beside the fact you get a \"free\" second sphere icon +  some resource acceleration on him! 3rd is tied because I think Sam is better but I use Imrahil more (yes I admit I like to chumpblock from time to time ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )\n\nWorst: Theodred\n\nTheodred would be tied with Balin for me but since Denethor is out there is no use for Theodred anymore (at least for me).\n\n \n\nTactics:\n\nBest: 1st: Legolas 2nd: Beregond 3rd: Eomer\n\nLegolas is just the best. He is great even if he's your only tactics hero in the deck and his single hero progress making is unmatched! In the end you only win by making progress and Legolas shines in that matter + he kills of your enemies! Beregond is 2nd in there because he is just the greatest defender in this game. Get him a shield and he is set to defend. Third one is most likely a personal choice but I just like the Eomer playstyle. Chump with some cheap weekling and strike back hard with Eomer on Firefoot.:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nWorst: Dori\n\nTwo hero actions just to get a defense with +2?! Sorry not a deal for me...\n\n \n\nSpirit:\n\nBest: 1st: Galadriel 2nd: Arwen 3rd: tiw between Caldara and Glorfindel\n\nGaladriel is just so powerful because you get a free action out of every ally you play in his first turn and she can keep your thread low and gets you card + access to lore \"for free\". That combination puts her (at least for me) above Arwen witch is really great too. Core for the Noldor stuff and generates resources in spirit without the Stargaizer+Zigi combo. Third is a tie because Caldara deck just got real with the latest stuff and my version of the Galadriel/Arwen/Caldara deck is my favorite deck to play right now. But as much as I'm sick of Glorfindel, his spirit hero version is just mind-blowing for 5! thread + his toys (Light/Asfaloth). Perfect match for Legolas too because he can use the same kind of weapons and you get questing + attack so only some defense out of your third hero is needed. But also very splas hable because he just has 5 thread (+ Light of Valinor is access able) witch allows you to use two \"big\" heroes in conjunction with him.\n\nWorst: Fatty and Piipin\n\nBoth heroes are just really really really bad and have rightfully taken top spots in the worst hero contest in this forum!\n\n \n\nLore:\n\nBest: 1st: Elrond 2nd: Rossiel 3rd: tie between Haldir and Pippin\n\nElrond has just such good stats and can get you anything you want with Vilya so clear choice for Nr. 1. Since I don't play much lore I go on with heroes I simply play the most and there comes Rossiel in at second place. I love my Rossiel secrecy deck and think that if you play her correctly a secrecy deck including her stuff + Hobbit-Gandalf really shines in multiplayer. Third choice is again a tie because Haldir pairs really well as a single hero in any deck that has access to some tactics weapons and Pippin is very splash able too. He get's you cards, low thread and two willpower for questing witch is a good all around package. But as I said Lore is my least favorite sphere so I don't play a lot of lore heroes.\n\nWorst: probably Grima\n\nI played him in a solo grief deck, didn't like it because there was no punsh in it and since then Grima is unused. Just not a good hero in multiplayer (which I play the most) and statwise he is weak for 9 thread."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2382290","commentId":2382290,"userName":"DurinVoronwe","timestamp":1472041845,"content":"My worst tactics hero is in solo Dori and in multiplayer... maybe Beorn or Eowyn or Thalin.

He has a built in action advantage, however you likely have to use it defending against the enemy you keep engaged with you (baring Forest Snare), so you really aren't gaining anything.  Without an enemy engaged, he quests for 2.  With an enemy engaged, he quests for 2 and then likely has to defend against said enemy.  Net gain of a risky shadow card.  Not worth it.  His other ability is too situational and often useless.\n\nFaramir - I'm normally a big fan of abilities that give ready characters, but his threat/keyword for lack luster stats is off putting.  Again, his traits hamper his effectiveness due to no good/reliable weapons.  As a ranged character, his other stats are not really relevant, making them a waste vs his threat cost.  High threat hampers the use of Dagger of Westernesse, the only weapon he can use to get +2 attack without Elf-Friend.\n\nElfhelm - He's only on her because he seems like he would be terrible for solo play and takes a fair amount of coordination for group play.  Granted, some mounts - such as Rohan Warhorse - are used often in Fellowships, but I'm not sure that alone is worth taking up an entire Hero slot for no other gains.  \n\n \n\nSpirit:\n\nFatty - well all know it.\n\nPippin - this is a given as well.\n\nDwalin - simply because I had to put a third on here.  He works for thematic decks and against the right scenario but is the most situational.  Oin is close behind but isn't encounter specific.  \n\n \n\nLore:\n\nBombur - sure you can make use of him in thematic decks, but he's still one of the worst Lore has to offer\n\nFaramir - talk about a conflict of interests!   High threat, mid-ling stats, ranged and a buff that is counter to high-threat...  He is also in the way of Ally Faramir.\n\nGlorfindel - Sure, easy access to Asfolof, but that is not worth that starting threat or garbage ability.  \n\n \n\nTactics: \n\nBeorn - I feel like with his 1 shield and immunity, against today's high damage monsters or nightmare quests, he isn't as useful as I'd want in a hero.   I will admit I need to use him more to better judge, but I have played with the other tactics heroes a lot and find them reliable, so he makes the cut.\n\nBrand son of Bain - Sure, he's got a built in standing ability, but it is only useful if that other player has multiple enemies engaged and his single trait is restrictive to good attachments.\n\nThalin - He is fun to use to clip every enemy that comes out, but often that 1 damage doesn't amount to much.  Without Dain, his 1 WP isn't much either.  He is good for killing ravens, but that's about it.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2386483","commentId":2386483,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1472231948,"content":"I think the value of Brand's ability is directly proportional to the exhaust abilities on the deck he's helping.  I paired Brand in a fellowship opposite a Three Rings deck, so even if there was only one enemy to destroy, he could ready Galadriel for her ability or Elrond for Vilya or Gandalf for Word of Command.  Allies like Gleowine are also excellent."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2386604","commentId":2386604,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1472235286,"content":"It's like dr00 said, each tactics hero really does have his place.  I still feel those three are the worst of them.   I agree Brand's ability gets a lot more useful with what he is paired with -

stats work against ability, but the main thing that bugs me is the developers realised fairly early on how powerful his ability was and started adding weird effects to counteract him, like Toughness, making him almost necessary for some quests like Return to Mirkwood and completely useless in later quests\n\nBrand - compared to Bard, i like Bard better, but i feel that there's fairly similar in that they're hard to utilise to their full potential.  Bard gets the nod for being absolutely amazing with Tactics Merry though\n\nGimli - i didn't type out my rationale before, but basically, he needs a lot of support to get going, otherwise (or even with support) he's a high risk scenario with not necessarily a high reward, when you could just play some allies or attachments to help with attacking power.  plus, he's still a liability, even when there isn't much to attack.  Gloin is a dwarf with a similar ability who can actually be healed, unlike Gimli, who loses his boosts if he gets healed.\n\n \n\n \n\nfor the others:\n\n \n\nLeadership:\n\nBoromir: i always find that when i want to make a Gondor-themed deck, i end up just making things like Guard of the Citadel not terrible for their cost, but only if i can get all of my support pieces.  and some Gondorian allies work against the trait and are better within their sphere, like Pelargir Shipwright.  i also find that, in the end, Outlands just does it a lot better and can build itself with all the pieces you find.\n\nHalbarad:  i actually really like his ability to quest while engaged, but optionally engaging two enemies is useless, and Amarthiul just does this so much better if you want to stay engaged with enemies\n\nFaramir:  i like ally Faramir much more than any other Faramir, so all of them will be inferior imo.  i also find that not many allies worth playing are worth readying when you would typically engage an enemy.  combined with Aragorn, Mablung, or something, could be something there, but again, not many allies are worth the readying effect.  that said, i've included him in an Outlands deck, and it's not terrible (he's likely getting completely replaced with Imrahil when City of Corsairs comes out though)\n\n \n\n \n\nTactics: (above)\n\n \n\n \n\nSpirit:\n\n \n\nPippin - there's just nothing redeemable at all whatsoever except that you can do a mono-spirit Hobbit deck while still using fellowship Frodo for the saga quests.\n\nFatty Bolger - i actually like Fatty a lot and how he can work with Spirit Merry (and Hobbit ponies can get them to quest if they aren't needed), but until you get a Hobbit Pony, it's useless, and even then, only really helpful in multiplayer, not that helpful, etc. etc.\n\nDwalin - Nori exists.  also only works on certain quests/enemies, and lowering your threat is often a way to avoid conflict, but his ability only works if you're actively engaging/killing things, so i'm not sure how useful the threat reduction really is, unless you're able to keep yourself below secrecy.  again, only works on Orc enemies though\n\n \n\n \n\nLore:\n\n \n\nGrima:  i know he's in the top for a lot of lists, but i find him a huge liability for multiplayer (where i think the game truly shines).  he's also one of only two Rohan-themed Lore cards, which annoys me to no end, even if it does make sense that he wouldn't exactly be helpful in a Rohan-themed deck\n\nBilbo:  great for solo-deck single player.  less and less useful after that, and his threat is super high for his super low stats.  he doesn't synergise well with hobbit-themed decks either, especially since ally Bilbo is so good in that regard\n\nGlorfindel:  i just...  meh."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228077-differing-opinions/?do=findComment&comment=2387415","commentId":2387415,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1472284966,"content":"My strongest 3 picks in no particular order and not including fun factor.\n\nTactics:\n\nLegolas\n\nBoromir\n\nBeregond\n\nWorst: Dori.
