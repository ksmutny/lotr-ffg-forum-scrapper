It is a pitty Imrahil can use the response only once but that would surely be too powerful, so not a pitty, actually. He is just great. And if one wonders who to drop, just drop Aragorn, as Imrahil is better (a guess, obviously). I really think his response is super useful. Any time you sneak in something for a quest, he gets ready after questing to either defend or attack - and both he does in some fashion. He is cheaper than Aragorn for the same willpower, attack and defense. I would not worry much about the lower hps. He is also Gondorian, so there he prevails over Aragorn as For Gondor! makes him super defender. Yes, Aragorn can combo with Celebrian's Stone and he is Sentinel - also to consider; however, the response I would not think much about as which is better, I'd take Imrahil's any time - you just need to build a deck about it. Aragorn's readiness comes with a great price - albeit in Leadership deck.\n\nHaldir of Lórien is great. Especially in the Lore dept. Lore can really do with some additional combat skills.\n\nParting Gifts, perfect. Especially as we are getting more cards that may use this.

And it is usually after many quests that a hero proves better and worse, and that usually switches according to a quest and situation.

Or try it out, anyways, if you haven't. Éowyn is an obvious choice for a solo deck, Théodred is awesome there too as he generates either Leadership or Spirit resources, as you will hardly ever leave either of the two not questing. To round this up, Beravor for drawing and overall usefulness perhaps? That gives you 27 to start with, much better than 32 which is a suicide mission for either Anduin or Carrock.\n\nImrahil could also work in there I think. With Gandalf and Horse-breaker or Snowbourn Scout, you should be able to ready him quite often. I have already tried this quite a bit and beat Carrock with him on try one. He seems to ready enough times to be of significant help in combat.\n\nOr perhaps you will tell me otherwise. Were you successful enough to lower threat in the opening rounds? Is it not too risky, especially in Anduin? I know you have more time to do so in Carrock but then again, the encounter deck is much more dangerous in there, thus balancing this out some way."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51983-prince-imrahil-details/?do=findComment&comment=520762","commentId":520762,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1314458310,"content":"Eowyn/Theodred/Beravor was always my most successful lineup in order to pass the Anduin scenario.
