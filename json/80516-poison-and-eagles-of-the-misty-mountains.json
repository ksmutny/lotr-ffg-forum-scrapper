Eagles of the Misty Mountains gets +1icon_attack.jpg [http://lotrlcg.com/img/other/icon_attack.jpg] and +1icon_defense.jpg [http://lotrlcg.com/img/other/icon_defense.jpg]for each facedown attachment it has.\"\n\nThe On the Doorstep rules insert says the following about poison:\n\n\"Facedown cards attached to chararcters are considered \"poison.\"  Poison cards are Condition attachments, and characters with any number of poison attached are considered 'poisoned.'\"\n\nThere's a little conflict here, since the Venom mechanic and the Eagles of the Misty Mountains card both use facedown cards as attachments.  I guess there are three possible ways to resolve:\n\n1) Keep the Eagles' \"eagle\" attachments separated from the \"poison\" attachments.\n\n2) All facedown attachments are considered poison; ignore the Eagle's text.\n\n3) All facedown attachments are considered poison, but because they are still facedown attachments, they will simultaneously poison and power up Eagles of the Misty Mountains.\n\nHow would you play this?  I chose to read the rules as literally as I felt was possible, and went with #3.  This made the Eagles card interesting -- it can quickly be powered up by allowing it to be poisoned, but triggering his Response and attaching more Eagles to them will also increase their poison… so they can be rendered unconcious very quickly, also.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80516-poison-and-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=772148","commentId":772148,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1362914992,"content":"Hmm… This is interesting.  I don't have an answer for you, but I'd probably keep the attachments separate.  But what do I know.  You may want to send this in to Caleb Grace.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80516-poison-and-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=772341","commentId":772341,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1362963574,"content":"Someone from the Cardboard of the Rings podcast asked Caleb about this and got a response. \n\nEagles of the Misty Mountains do indeed get a boost from Poison attachments."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80516-poison-and-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=772342","commentId":772342,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1362963647,"content":"On a semi-related note,  Beorn can't have Attachments. \n\nLet loose your bears and eagles on those spiders!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80516-poison-and-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=772401","commentId":772401,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1362978982,"content":"Thanks for that gatharion!"}]}
