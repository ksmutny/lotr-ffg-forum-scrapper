By courage and skill in arms he survived the disaster of the Fords, but fell in the Battle of the Pelennor, to the great grief of Westfold. [Author's note.] - Dúnhere was Lord of Harrowdale (The Return of the King V 3).\n\n \n\nJust thought I would share this with others who are curious about the lore, but haven't come across this bit.  Now I wonder, are Eleanor and Beravor purely FFG creations, or is there a footnote out there for them, too?\n\n \n\nEDIT: I guess it is Thalin that was an FFG creation, that's what I was forgetting.  Unless I am mistaken about that as well!  \n\nEdited March 10, 2014 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100936-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1008256","commentId":1008256,"userName":"oldoly","timestamp":1394429618,"content":"I always thought Eleanor was Sam and Rosie's daughter."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100936-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1008258","commentId":1008258,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1394429821,"content":"Eleanor, Beravor, and Thalin are 100% FFG creations, and they all come from the Middle Earth quest board game, where all of the heroes you could choose were made up by FFG (there was also a Rohan character, which I can't remember the name of at the moment).\n\n \n\nMirlonde and Caldara are also FFG creations."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100936-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1008819","commentId":1008819,"userName":"oldoly","timestamp":1394481796,"content":"> Eleanor, Beravor, and Thalin are 100% FFG creations, and they all come from the Middle Earth quest board game, where all of the heroes you could choose were made up by FFG (there was also a Rohan character, which I can't remember the name of at the moment).\n> \n>  \n> \n> Mirlonde and Caldara are also FFG creations.\n\nI actually meant to say in my post \"I always assumed...until Ian from TFtC pointedly out to me.\" You're a wealth of knowledge!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100936-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1008832","commentId":1008832,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1394482588,"content":">  (there was also a Rohan character, which I can't remember the name of at the moment).\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n\nEometh.

I think Mirlonde replaced Argolad in some senses, while Eleanor and Beravor were included to make up for the lack of female characters (not sure why Thalin made the Core Set, but I've got a soft spot for him!)\n\n \n\nEdit: I should say, I think that's why they were included, don't know for sure!\n\nEdited March 10, 2014 by Raven1015"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100936-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1009714","commentId":1009714,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1394557489,"content":"The Dunhere subject was discussed bofore on other threads.\n\nHe was the lord of dunharrow and if i remember well he was killed in the pellenor fields"}]}
