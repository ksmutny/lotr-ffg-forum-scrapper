Over the course of a game there is often one card type that you cannot tolerate dealing with. Maybe you're on the verge of location lock, maybe you're strapped for defenders.

With the ability to recur it through Gamling and set off a bunch of response triggers when discarded... It could have been a nice tool for the Rohan discard deck."}]}
