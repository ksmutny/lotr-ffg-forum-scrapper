So, for instance, if I realise that my deck's willpower is not higher than the encounter deck's threat, I can then discard a card to increase Eowyn's will to 5 and resolve the quest?\n\n \n\n(I've encountered other similar effects that I've been wondering about as well.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86750-actions-before-resolving-quests/?do=findComment&comment=818456","commentId":818456,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1374409143,"content":"sure. you can play actions in this green window.\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86750-actions-before-resolving-quests/?do=findComment&comment=818460","commentId":818460,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1374409682,"content":"I thought so, thanks!
