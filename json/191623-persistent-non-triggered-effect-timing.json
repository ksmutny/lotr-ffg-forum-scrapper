See if you can follow my terrible explanation and let me know where I go wrong!\n \nIf you can think back to \"The Redhorn Gate\" there is a few interacting persistent effects that are not triggered, they are \"always on\".\n \nClipboard_1.jpg [http://s12.postimg.org/70b7e0b3h/Clipboard_1.jpg]\n\nClipboard_3.jpg [http://s7.postimg.org/hbniuvebf/Clipboard_3.jpg]\n\nClipboard_4.jpg [http://s2.postimg.org/64ldlpgdl/Clipboard_4.jpg]\n\nClipboard_5.jpg [http://s12.postimg.org/z0jwc13xp/Clipboard_5.jpg]\n\n \n\nSo all these effects... are \"always on\".\n\n \n\nDain = +1 Will (untapped)\n\nFreezing Cold = -2 Will (when attached)\n\nCaradhras = -1 Will (To Questers when in travel location)\n\nQuest Card = 0 Will characters discarded.\n\n \n\n1) Now... as far as I remember unlike responses and all that, there is in fact no order for how these effects resolve. You simply apply the effects as a sum, and then after all the effects are accounted for, you have a result.\n\n \n\nSo, you do not choose any \"order\" to resolve these effects.\n\n \n\nThe reason this counts is that if you DO resolve by order then depending on the order you choose Dain will save characters from ever having 0 Will, and other orders will end up giving 0 Will to characters.\n\n \n\n2) We all know that characters can not go below 0 Will, but during the calculation of Persistent Effects they CAN go under. If you are under zero after all effects are calculated then you round up towards 0.\n\n \n\nThis matters because if you can never go below 0 Will, Dain will always bounce any character to 1 Will (while he is untapped)\n\n \n\nSo... am I close, or should I be hanging my head in shame waiting for 6 of the best trousers down?\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191623-persistent-non-triggered-effect-timing/?do=findComment&comment=1854558","commentId":1854558,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1445238093,"content":"I think you have to add/substract any of your WILL-Values and check the result.
