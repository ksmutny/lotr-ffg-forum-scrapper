So without yet a new preview, I still want to encourage a discussion about this. Plus, there's tons of hints in both the announcement and the description page.\n\n \n\nSo far I think we can expect: Tons of enemy engaging shenanigans is what most sticks out, plus we have spoilers. I am truly expecting a Tactics-Lore-Leadership deck a la Silvan emerge to power, since pretty much anything that uses Aragorn and Leadership ca be pretty bonkers with STWB, and the allies spoiled so far have good willpower. And there's the fact that coincidentally there are 3 options for Aragorn in that deck, which makes it pretty interesting. I also think we'll get a new Leadership hero in The Lost Realm, hopefully Halbarad. That'd be so cool, this is the perfect time for him to appear. Also the new \"Encounter\" keyword cards that get shuffled into the encounter deck. The page says that Ranger of the North \"intruduces\" that keyword, so we'll probablyhave events or attachments. It's gonna be maybe a bit fiddly but I've always loved allies that appear from the encounter deck. And finally side quests, which also look really interesting, but I hope that they'll be more that just location cards in practice.\n\n \n\nAlso from a lore perspective, hopefully not only the Dunedain as great trackers and hunters, which is cool alright, but also their ties to Númenor and Elendil and all the epic Second Age stuff. An Elendilmir or Palantir attachment card would be just perfect.\n\n \n\nYet another edit: for heroes in the cycle, I'd like to see really obscure characters, and some old characters come to life again. We definately need a new Brand hero, in another sphere though, with a cool ability and he comes with the title \"King of Dale\" attachment. Theoden needs a new incarnation as well IMO, maybe Leadership but I'd really like to see him in Spirit. As for obscure characters, spoiler alert: we know that the aformentioned Brand and his buddy Dain were slain pretty much in the middle of the time period this game is allowed to use, so we could also have their heirs Bard II and Thorin Stonehelm. That'd be really cool, and could flesh out many new archetypes. But these are mostly my hopes.\n\nEdited January 19, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132395-things-to-expect-from-the-lost-realm-and-angmar-awakened/?do=findComment&comment=1412341","commentId":1412341,"userName":"jormungandr","timestamp":1421663654,"content":"I'm really hoping for other player cards that effect different game regions, like the encounter keyword.

We've already seen some really nifty mechanics when it comes to engagement etc. A proper Dúnedain scrying, trapping and support deck would be great fun to play.\n\n \n\nWe know we're getting a Tactics Aragorn. I'm hoping for new hero versions of the hobbits, and maybe of the elves in Rivendell and Mithlond. Glorfindel already has two incarnations, of course (no pun intended) and Elrond can already pay for any ally, but you never know. Maybe a hero version of Arwen (though I love the ally)? \n\n \n\nIf we get a hero Cirdan, I'll quite literally explode. Give him Narya as well, and make it possible to attach it to Gandalf. As it \"kindles the hearts of the free peoples\", it might provide a willpower or health buff to allies or something. If so, it should probably cost around 3 resources like StwB for Aragorn.\n\n \n\nThat's daydreaming, though. A Halbarad hero feels like a good bet.\n\nEdited January 19, 2015 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132395-things-to-expect-from-the-lost-realm-and-angmar-awakened/?do=findComment&comment=1412660","commentId":1412660,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1421682055,"content":"Saruman hero is definitely what we need.

Why were there stewards and not kings from Mardil onward?\n\n \n\nGreat question! My sense is that the Kings of Gondor were to preoccupied defending against Mordor to pay much heed to their erstwhile brethren in the North.\n\n \n\nAs for why the Stewards ended up taking over, it is actually linked to lore mentioned in the article. Earnur, the Captain of Gondor and son of the King, did go north with a fleet to fight the Witch-king alongside Elrond and Glorfindel in 1974. But his horse 'could not endure that onset' and ran away.\n\n \n\nAfterwards, Earnur was seething for a rematch with the Witch-king who had punked him at the Battle of Fornost. In the year 2043, Earnur took the crown from his father and the Witch-king, now relocated to Minas Morgul in South 'challenged him to single combat, taunting him that he had dared not stand before him in battle in the North'. Although his Steward Mardil talked him out of the fight at the time, 7 years later, the Witch-king 'repeated his challenge, taunting the king that to the faint heart of his youth he had now added the weakness of age'.\n\n \n\nLike Marty McFly in the Back to the Future movies, Earnur couldn't stand to be called chicken any longer.\n\n \n\nEarnur rode out to face the Witch-king but 'none of that riding were ever heard of again'. It was assumed Earnur died in torment in Minas Morgul. Since the line of Kings in Gondor had been thinned by the three 'great evils' (the Kin-strife, the Great Plague, and the Wainriders), 'no claimant to the crown could be found who was of pure blood or whose claim all would allow' and so the heirs of Mardil continued to rule while 'the crown of Elendil lay in the lap of King Earnil in the Houses of the Dead, where Earnur had left it.'\n\nEdited February 18, 2015 by Kerstoid"}]}
