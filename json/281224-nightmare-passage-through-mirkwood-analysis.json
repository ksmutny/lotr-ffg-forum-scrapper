NM Passage through Mirkwood added some teeth to the scenario, but it is still easy enough to use as a moderate difficulty testing quest. https://visionofthepalantir.com/…/nightmare-passage-throug…/ [https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fvisionofthepalantir.com%2F2018%2F08%2F18%2Fnightmare-passage-through-mirkwood%2F&h=AT2lkCwkxlLS6ukTt0A_esdRjgIVlYFiSqkAn2epA3FAsGL0kp8wTrT0drOSNVb4q0e5llJlZPJyNkTlOPphr1Cz98JrwePGmRjRtS7uyNd7kwZuE_oqFx5YZnaOmRFQuH12y7TlhPB9umsLM3YXTB8Ks1IIQ4MG7BHRyrvrU_xDLAbvsCqhmp8xpIXZbHOq6jOUKY-i-MUzzWpe9zKiPsXyk18CwU5UuG7hBe-BYQe0e1LK7ARa6zA8LnINX1EeI_Rf1nmc5th_EtU1mIb8ipYd9T4eC2dzWritJge-M3SyRZLFIY1KZy9s6u43J-QV-KSLNbpW7XVvwI14rmP50wCACsiiWC6_jVaPgTe8]\n\nI will be doing a couple more of these NM articles on scenarios I own and have played, but I don't have many yet. So if you would like to do the write up for an NM version of a quest I already covered in Normal mode, I will gladly take it. In the meantime, I will get started on the Angmar Awakened cycle.\n\nThis article was made possible thanks to my Patreon supporters.
