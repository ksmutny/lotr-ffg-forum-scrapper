The card goes well with Thalin, obviously, and other direct damage, like Hail of Stones, Gondorian Spearman, Spear of the Citadel. Killing enemies by direct damage is very effective, not only it reduces (in some cases) the threat in the staging area but it get you rid of their attacking value and shadow effect, not to mention bypassing their defence. I do hope, however, that one day this card gets way better, I believe minor factions like Bardings or Beornings should have powerful cards, since it is easier to avoid power-creep problems due synergies.\n\n \n\nI haven't really used any of the other cards mentioned.

There are those early scenarios in which you didn't want to proceed to the next stage, where Early Onward helps you to make zero progress without getting a penalty. It's also helpful when you want to face some tough enemies with all your forces. You can play Bofur for only one resource with that card.

KET can actually do *something*. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96502-cards-that-you-have-never-played-them/?do=findComment&comment=962472","commentId":962472,"userName":"Style75","timestamp":1390496463,"content":">  \n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> >  \n> \n> > Gandalf's Search will play a much bigger role in the upcoming Voice of Isengard set due to the nasty effects linked to hand size.

But even if you are using Stargazer and Gildor, Gandalf's search will still be useful. Card draw is by far one of the most powerful effects in this game but most of the newer card draw effects are pulling multiple cards out of your deck (ex. 3 from Mithrandir's advice if you are playing with 3 lore heroes). In the new scenarios with the Dunlendings, you really don't want to draw lots of cards, you only need that one key card to solve the issue at hand. So you use Stargazer to set it up for you and Gandalf's search to pull it out of the deck. If you don't have Stargazer, you can use Gandalf's Search to dig a little deeper to find what you need. Gildor is definitely a good choice for the Dunlending problem and I'll definitely be putting him in my decks, but he's a cost 5 unique which means he won't be hitting the table until at least turn 3, maybe later. Gandalf's Search could be used for card draw on turn one.\n\n \n\nI'm not saying Gandalf's Search is now some sort of super card, I'm just saying that the new mechanics that severely punish having lots of cards in hand will elevate Gandalf's Search above coaster status and make it playable again. Until, of course, this cycle is over and then it'll be back to coaster status again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96502-cards-that-you-have-never-played-them/?do=findComment&comment=962476","commentId":962476,"userName":"Style75","timestamp":1390496843,"content":"> This card i haven't never used:\n> \n>  \n> \n> ffg_against-the-shadow-tdf.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_against-the-shadow-tdf.jpg]\n> \n>  \n> \n> Does anyone use it?\n\n \n\nYes, if I'm trying to use a monospirit deck in any quest that has a lot of siege questing. Cair Andros springs to mind. This card can be life saver as I find siege questing to be the most difficult part of the AtS cycle.\n\n \n\nIt's a niche card. When you need it, you really really need it, but outside of those decks and those scenarios, the card is not a good choice."}]}
