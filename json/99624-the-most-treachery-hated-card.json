Caleb ruled it's equal to the number you counted, not shuffled. The card could be clearer, for sure.\n\n \n\nMy rule of thumb is, when in doubt, go for what makes it more difficult for the players. There are lots of folks trying to contort cards to make them do what they want it to do (Hands Upon the Bow is a prime example), or even this one. So, basically, if it makes it harder for me, I'll typically go with that interpretation.

It sucks that we have all these cool cards with cool effects that would allow you to outfox and defeat the Witch-King or a Nazgul, only to have him be immune to literally every effect you have except damage.

That quest is hard enough in nightmare and you already lose a villager every turn if you don't reveal an extra encounter card during staging but no there just has to be this awful treachery/condition attachment as well.\n\nThematically what the hell is going on? I get that it sort of represents the various survivors of Amon Din being split apart and you therefore lose tokens from rescued villagers as some survivors split off and get lost or rescued by others or whatever however in the quest whenever villager tokens are discarded from a location, OBJECTIVE, or quest stage that token is then placed on dead villagers..... so not only would this card make you lose a token on rescued villagers each and every turn but you also gain one on dead villagers each and every turn from this effect. Do you think this is actually a mistake by the designers? It seems to me like this card should represent losing a token off rescued villagers but in no way should equate to more dead villagers as well....\n\nUnless these two armoured guards are actually dark men fighting for Sauron who are pretending to be saviours but actually killing or enslaving these rescued villagers? \n\n \n\nDoesn't make sense mechanically or thematically and is certainly a very powerful and nasty treachery. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99624-the-most-treachery-hated-card/?do=findComment&comment=1850676","commentId":1850676,"userName":"awp832","timestamp":1444959759,"content":"Probably the Master's Malice for me.   Does nothing to monosphere,  wrecks anything else.  Mean.\n\n\n\nTake Cover gets honorable mention for me, and Southern Support as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99624-the-most-treachery-hated-card/?do=findComment&comment=1851018","commentId":1851018,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1444989973,"content":"> Those-Now-Sundered.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Encounter-at-Amon-Din-Nightmare/Those-Now-Sundered.jpg]\n> \n>  \n> \n> Oh sure, surge and doomed 1!
