(Limit once per phase.)\n\nAttachment Heir of Mardil reads: Response: After attached hero gains any number of resources from a card effect, exhaust Heir of Mardil to ready attached hero.\n\nIs the response in Heir of Mardil considered a card effect or a response? Would Malblung be readied in this example if he gets a resource token from his own response ability? \n\nIs there a definition for what qualifies as card effect? Is it basically anything that comes from a card? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283771-what-is-considered-a-card-effect/?do=findComment&comment=3488450","commentId":3488450,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1538350077,"content":"It's pretty much everything that comes from a card that isn't already covered by the standard rules. For instance, dealing damage from an attack exhausting to commit to a quest aren't card effects. There are also some subtleties with the scope of a card effect. For example, Quick Strike's card effect causes the target to make an attack. This is a card effect. However, the attack itself is not a card effect, so can be used to attack \"immune to player card effects\" enemies.\n\nNote however that Heir of Mardil can only be attached to Noble heroes, so to get it on Mablung you also need the Diligent Noble card or similar trickery."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283771-what-is-considered-a-card-effect/?do=findComment&comment=3488473","commentId":3488473,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1538352450,"content":"NathanH is right about your case: every effect on a card that give resource work for heir of mardil. Mablung work, steward of Gondor work. I would say that neclace of girion/resourceful work too. But sword-thain didn't work since, even if it make you have one resource more, only rule give a resource to the new heroes created by the effect, not the card effect itself.\n\nBut his quick strike example is wrong: quick strike target the enemy so we can't choose an enemy with \"immune to player card effects\".
