Any card effect that that requires a certain type of non-Lore resource cannot be the target of Elrond's ability."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97126-elrond-and-winged-guardian/?do=findComment&comment=958154","commentId":958154,"userName":"rokkon","timestamp":1390111479,"content":"That explains it.  It's sometimes hard for me NOT to read into things that aren't there.\n\n \n\nThanks, much."}]}
