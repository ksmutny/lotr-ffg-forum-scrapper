The card I drew was \"Through the Mist\" which, when revealed, the first player must make an Escape Test with two cards from the encounter deck. I assume that you must immediately do the test, exhaust whichever characters you want. My question is then, do those heroes/charaters refresh before the \"first turn\" -- my thought it no, so that's a crappy card to pull right off the bat. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66675-escape-test-question/?do=findComment&comment=650727","commentId":650727,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1340820013,"content":"you are correct- the first refresh of the game happens after the first round"}]}
