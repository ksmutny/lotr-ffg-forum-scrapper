Sounds like play with 2 heroes instead 3?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59089-so-what-do-we-all-think-of-bofur-and-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=580617","commentId":580617,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326787540,"content":"I've been experimenting with 2 player games only using 3 heroes total recently. I think 20 is a good number for secrecy as it is a very achievable threat level but not so high that it is really easy.\n\nWith Ziggy having single hero decks is not an issue resource wise and Bofur is the perfect companion to the prince. So starting at 11 threat gives you a few turns b4 there is a problem. The other deck need to run more traditional though I would think. Still you only need one deck running secrecy cards.\n\nWe will have to see how it goes as it will depend on what the secrecy cards do.. all in all I think it is a really good addition to the game.\n\nFor solo players I think secrecy will be hard to maintain. I do have a Ziggy solo deck i am refining that uses JUST dunhere that starts at 8 threat I made it as a experiment, and if you got zig in your 1st hand it played surprisingly well, so with \"secrecy\" cards in it, it might be a \"real\"deck some day.\n\nRemember secrecy (as i understand it) is a modify to the cost, so it might cost 5, but with secrecy it will cost 2. Still Ziggy will trigger at 5 not 2 as 5 is the base cost. The point I am trying to make is that if the secrecy cards are to low cost then Ziggy will not function reliably and thus the solo single hero deck might never get off the ground as I have envisioned it at this stage."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59089-so-what-do-we-all-think-of-bofur-and-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=580658","commentId":580658,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1326793469,"content":"If you can start your threat in the mid-20s and get a GG and sneak Gandalf early, getting your threat below 20 is not impossible.  Keeping it there long enough to use/get secrecy in hand might be, but not with the right card drawing machines as booored and some of the others have taught me! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59089-so-what-do-we-all-think-of-bofur-and-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=580735","commentId":580735,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1326802103,"content":"Zjb12 said:\n\nIf you can start your threat in the mid-20s and get a GG and sneak Gandalf early, getting your threat below 20 is not impossible.  Keeping it there long enough to use/get secrecy in hand might be, but not with the right card drawing machines as booored and some of the others have taught me! \n\n\n\ni believe we may be seeing some more threat reduction cards in the near future.....would make sense"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59089-so-what-do-we-all-think-of-bofur-and-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=580775","commentId":580775,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1326804960,"content":"One of the things I've been happiest about with Khazad-dum, is that the strength of the dwarf synergy has taken some emphasis away from Spirit and their evil queen, Eowyn who constantly says to us, \"you don't really think you can beat a game with ME, do you?\"\n\nHowever, now with this secrecy thing, I'm worried that this will again put the spotlight back on Spirit as the strongest sphere. \nThat being said, seeing that this first secrecy card is for Leadership, perhaps it will at least encourage us to use other spheres in combination with Spirit."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59089-so-what-do-we-all-think-of-bofur-and-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=580778","commentId":580778,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1326805070,"content":"Narsil0420 said:\n\nOne of the things I've been happiest about with Khazad-dum, is that the strength of the dwarf synergy has taken some emphasis away from Spirit and their evil queen, Eowyn who constantly says to us, \"you don't really think you can beat a game with ME, do you?\"\n\nHowever, now with this secrecy thing, I'm worried that this will again put the spotlight back on Spirit as the strongest sphere. \nThat being said, seeing that this first secrecy card is for Leadership, perhaps it will at least encourage us to use other spheres in combination with Spirit.\n\n\n\nyeah eowyn is the evil queen indeed, im sick of seeing her attractive face in my decks, though im cutting her out piece by piece"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59089-so-what-do-we-all-think-of-bofur-and-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=580782","commentId":580782,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1326805386,"content":"Is Éowyn really that bad?\n\n \n\nI built a Spirit deck just because of her!

Since I bought the game, she was in my decks. Though my first reason was because she is one of my favorite of LotR's characters.\n\nI'm now creating a 'Campaign' of sorts, where you must do the entire first cycle (TMaO included) with the same decks. The difference between that and the rulebook campaign, is that you got bonuses and penalties according to your failure or victories in each scenario. If you fail the 'Escape From Dol Guldur' losing by threat, your penalty to the first AP is that you cannot have Eowyn in the starting heroes until you win again. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59089-so-what-do-we-all-think-of-bofur-and-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=580800","commentId":580800,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326807823,"content":"Grudunza said:\n\n I think he meant to say \"you don't really think you can win the game without me.\"\n\n\n\n \n\nI haven't made a single deck using Eyowen form the days of Conflict of the Carrock..
