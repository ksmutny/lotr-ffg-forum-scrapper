You obviously want to build a deck (or fellowship) that maximizes the potential. The questing value hit isn't a major work around. The attachments could be supplied by other players. And there are plenty of item/artifacts that make this contract a \"fun\" one, but not an efficient one. \n\nHere is the best that I could come up with:\n\nhttps://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/7818/aburglarsfellowship [https://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/7818/aburglarsfellowship]\n\nWhat I found was between all the nice tricks the \"support\" deck brought and legolas, we had absolutely no problem blowing through locations. Every now and then, we would have no active location during the quest phase because we knocked out two the previous round (or during planning). Haldan and Idrean were hurting for that reason.\n\nBesides recycling these two cards, I really don't see any kind of engine you could build to get through the loot deck. Maybe they were extremely restrictive on purpose so that there's no game breaking combos (I am guessing this is the truth because of the ruling that cards attached to locations cleared in staging evaporate instead of triggering into play or in hand). Maybe it's an oversight, maybe they thought there were more \"travel\" player cards in the pool. But my gosh, a nice tactics card could be \"combat action: when an enemy is destroyed, travel to a location, returning any previous active location to the staging area.\" It would combo very well with legolas/blades. \n\nOr maybe I'm just a whiner.\n\nEdited January 3 by player3351457\nGrammar is hard"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303966-the-burglars-turn-and-travelling-to-locations/?do=findComment&comment=3860836","commentId":3860836,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1578028837,"content":"Awesome thanks for the thread link and help, follow-up question is this: if a location with a contract guarded attachment is kicked into the staging area and then you travel there again does a second attachment get added? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303966-the-burglars-turn-and-travelling-to-locations/?do=findComment&comment=3860854","commentId":3860854,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1578033249,"content":"> 1 hour ago, General_Grievous said:\n> \n> Awesome thanks for the thread link and help, follow-up question is this: if a location with a contract guarded attachment is kicked into the staging area and then you travel there again does a second attachment get added? \n\nYes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303966-the-burglars-turn-and-travelling-to-locations/?do=findComment&comment=3861343","commentId":3861343,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1578080577,"content":"So I am reading The contract [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/The-Burglar%27s-Turn-WaR?Lang=EN]and Elf stone [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Elf-stone-TBR?Lang=EN] very carefully...\n\nIf I include elf stone in my loot deck, does not the combo seem to suggest:\n\n1.

However, the language of Caleb's ruling was the playing of attachments (i.e. from hand) was an illegal move. But because these attachments are not played, but attached as a \"guarded objective\".\n\nFurther, the nature of \"forced\" has me questioning this because if it were a response I would solidly say this is a #1. But forced effects, according to the rule book, \"initiate and resolve, whether the players want them to or not.\" I scanned the faq for forced effects vs immunity, and while I tend to agree with you, contracts have been given their own special framework and thus this might be allowed under the second paragraph of 1.47 (immune, expanded). Further, because the location itself isn't \"chosen\" by the players, the \"targeting\" paragraph might not apply."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303966-the-burglars-turn-and-travelling-to-locations/?do=findComment&comment=3899569","commentId":3899569,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1582309545,"content":"Perhaps I should've quoted earlier in the FAQ also:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Cards with the text \"Immune to player card effects\" ignore the effects of all player cards.
