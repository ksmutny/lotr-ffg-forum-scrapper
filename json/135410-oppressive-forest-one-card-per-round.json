I am afraid it is not possible to determine for sure.\n\n \n\nPersonally, I am strongly leaning towards the first option. As you said, we have no rules and no previous cases addressing this issue. In such case a literal understanding of the card is the simplest way to determine the mechanism.\n\n \n\nThe way I see it we should simply make the test: is Oppressive Forest in the staging area? YES. Did you play a card this round? YES. So no more cards for you, pal. I do not see how the moment of revealing the card should modify this test.\n\n \n\nAlso, the argument in favor of the second option that the games do not backtrack progress is not really persuasive for me. I am not experienced with other card games co I cannot comment meaningfully. But even if that is indeed the case with other games, I would expect it follows from some explicit rules (or rulings) in those games. We seem to have none of those in LotR so why create something. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135410-oppressive-forest-one-card-per-round/?do=findComment&comment=1457268","commentId":1457268,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1424445204,"content":"> This location is new, but there is another very old card ^^:\n> \n>  \n> \n> http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Through-the-Ruins-TMaO [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Through-the-Ruins-TMaO]\n\nInteresting.  I can't find any rules threads that refer to that card either.  How has this question never come up before?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135410-oppressive-forest-one-card-per-round/?do=findComment&comment=1457517","commentId":1457517,"userName":"krokodiler","timestamp":1424453411,"content":"We also have that card:\n\n \n\nThrough-the-Marsh-A-Forgotten-Land-2B.jp [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Nin-in-Eilph/Through-the-Marsh-A-Forgotten-Land-2B.jpg]\n\n \n\nwith similar, if not the same, effect.\n\n \n\nBUT, in comparison to an answer from Caleb for my question regarding effects of Asfaloth, as to me these two \"cannot\" effects seem similar:\n\n \n\n                 Q: When I reveal Snowdrifts treachery card, but I have already used Asfaloth in this round to place 2 progress tokens on active location, can I still add 3 progress or only 1?\n\n \n\nSnowdrifts.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Road-Darkens/Snowdrifts.jpg]\n\n \n\n                 A: Only 1.\n\n \n\nI'd say that if a card has already been played that round in planning phase, no more cards can be played.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135410-oppressive-forest-one-card-per-round/?do=findComment&comment=1457529","commentId":1457529,"userName":"Solaufein","timestamp":1424453694,"content":"> We also have that card:\n> \n>  \n> \n> Through-the-Marsh-A-Forgotten-Land-2B.jp [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Nin-in-Eilph/Through-the-Marsh-A-Forgotten-Land-2B.jpg]\n> \n>  \n> \n> with similar, if not the same, effect.\n> \n>  \n> \n> BUT, in comparison to an answer from Caleb for my question regarding effects of Asfaloth, as to me these two \"cannot\" effects seem similar:\n> \n>  \n> \n>                  Q: When I reveal Snowdrifts treachery card, but I have already used Asfaloth in this round to place 2 progress tokens on active location, can I still add 3 progress or only 1?\n> \n>  \n> \n> Snowdrifts.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Road-Darkens/Snowdrifts.jpg]\n> \n>  \n> \n>                  A: Only 1.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I'd say that if a card has already been played that round in planning phase, no more cards can be played.\n\n \n\n \n\nI was one of the folks arguing that game mechanics may not remember what has happened before they were in play in that game. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] However, based on that ruling on Snowdrifts, it seems they may indeed track things before they are in play, and thus the forest would limit you even if it popped up after the card had been played for the round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135410-oppressive-forest-one-card-per-round/?do=findComment&comment=1457674","commentId":1457674,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1424459642,"content":"But that contradicts the Ungoliant on first quest of Core....\n\n \n\nTo me they don't remember, but that is only my opinion"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135410-oppressive-forest-one-card-per-round/?do=findComment&comment=1457680","commentId":1457680,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1424459841,"content":"What happens with Ungoliant?
