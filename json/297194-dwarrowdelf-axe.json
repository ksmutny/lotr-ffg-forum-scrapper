Is this a typo on the new card? Doesn’t look like there’s Errata for it that I can see...maybe I missed it. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297194-dwarrowdelf-axe/?do=findComment&comment=3735361","commentId":3735361,"userName":"Steven Frizzell","timestamp":1562530540,"content":"You can see both versions on ringsdb.com. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297194-dwarrowdelf-axe/?do=findComment&comment=3735362","commentId":3735362,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1562531025,"content":"Looks like a typo to me but with all the other cards like Burning Brand and Battle Master getting changed who knows.

Both cards say to attach to a dwar character.\n\nDoesn't make any sense attach to a ally and don't get any bonus.\n\n \n\n \n\nOh and now the damage is for the defending character instead of the enemy as it was in the original one..."}]}
