When we have more cards out I II have a go at 50 card decks.\n\nThe steward of gondor card is great you can exhaust it every turn and give the attached hero 2 extra resourses a turn and with it attached to Denethor(the only Lore character I had) he ended up with more resources than both leadership characters.\n\nDoes the treachery web attachment card stay on your hero for the rest of the game?\n\n \n\nthanks regards mic"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49167-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=492548","commentId":492548,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1309297275,"content":"Yes it does, unless you get rid of it with the Lore ally (Miner of the Iron Hill I thinkk) that can get rid of a condition."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49167-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=492732","commentId":492732,"userName":"felix16","timestamp":1309337538,"content":" Actually (and this is a little funny) the shadow effect of Driven by Shadow can also get rid of Caught in a Web."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49167-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=492745","commentId":492745,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1309338633,"content":"Taken from the FAQ:\n\n(1.06) Control of Non-objective Encounter Cards\nPlayers do not gain control of encounter cards unless\ncontrol of the card is explicitly granted by a card\neffect.

I have spend around 7 turns without being able to make any progress on the first \"flies & spiders\" quest card. I did manage to get through one location card, but then one of the heroes got caught in the web and the best I could manage was to equal the opposing threat. A couple of frustrating turns without battles later, another location card landed that added 2 more threat points which I don't think I would ever get passed again.\n\nBasically, this happened to me: http://conceptofprogress.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/lord-of-the-rings-lcg-to-slay-an-orc/ [http://conceptofprogress.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/lord-of-the-rings-lcg-to-slay-an-orc/]\n\nSo okay, I guess I'll give the game another try with one of the other decks. And hopefully other first time players will be warned about this, because it can really mess up your first impression of the game. It's just not fun to have a lot of locations, no enemies and a huge allied army that can't get you any progress. :-/"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49167-solo-game/?do=findComment&comment=493797","commentId":493797,"userName":"felix16","timestamp":1309496017,"content":"Any of the others should do the trick well enough. Just hang in there and save the tactics deck for when you play with a friend."}]}
