Will start mix sphere next. I have the core set as stated but also have several adventure packs and Expansions. I love the theme and the game from the early days.\n\nBut I am asking do I store the cards in 9 holders to a card page sleeves or do I have to keep the cards separate in the adventure packs and therefor I am better storing them in the packs they came. Can I put all heroes in one to two pages ofÂ  cards pageand then all cards from one sphere from all adventure packs / Expansions, so if I am created a deck I can draw from all cards possible?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79336-storage-of-cards-all-in-of-keep-separate-beginner/?do=findComment&comment=763505","commentId":763505,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1361008584,"content":"The player cards should be sorted by sphere. You don't need to sort them by adventure, as they can be used in any of them."}]}
