I really wish FFG would release \"Campaign packs\" for each past cycle to include boons and burdens and campaign rules for old cycles similar to those used in the LOTR Saga Expansions. Of course, they have their hands full with Nightmare already, so it's a bit of a pipe dream, but I'd love to have a chance to level up characters between quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101593-forever-hunter/?do=findComment&comment=1016765","commentId":1016765,"userName":"Glowwyrm","timestamp":1395160643,"content":"I really like the idea of using victory points to purchase things between quests.  It would give you some extra incentive to play differently and chase down those victory points.  I think this system would only work well when there is a natural difficulty progression between quests (like in the Core Set quests), otherwise the quests would get too easy.  Maybe something fun to try out in Nightmare.  Or maybe the Forever Hunter could level up between scenarios (in addition to leveling up in the scenario).  Very cool idea!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101593-forever-hunter/?do=findComment&comment=1017005","commentId":1017005,"userName":"oldoly","timestamp":1395174017,"content":"> I really like the idea of using victory points to purchase things between quests.  It would give you some extra incentive to play differently and chase down those victory points.  I think this system would only work well when there is a natural difficulty progression between quests (like in the Core Set quests), otherwise the quests would get too easy.  Maybe something fun to try out in Nightmare.  Or maybe the Forever Hunter could level up between scenarios (in addition to leveling up in the scenario).  Very cool idea!\n\nThat would be really awesome, great idea!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101593-forever-hunter/?do=findComment&comment=1017308","commentId":1017308,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1395183343,"content":"Yes, I definitely agree. There should be some other use for victory points. All they do (other than help with score, of course... But really, I never keep track of score. It's either win or lose) is take the card out of the deck. If you could spend them for some kind of bonus for the next quest that you play it would be a very nice effect.\n\nEdited March 18, 2014 by legolas18"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101593-forever-hunter/?do=findComment&comment=1017335","commentId":1017335,"userName":"oldoly","timestamp":1395184632,"content":"^ love that signature, haha.
