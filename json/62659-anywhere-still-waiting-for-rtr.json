Nearly all of the packs I have bought have come from two sellers, Infinity Games and Gameslore - both have been fast delivery and have been available about a week (or so) after the US - I still can't work out UK release dates because the websites seem to have different dates on them. Both the stores I use have websites where you can order the items from as well as from ebay, ebay just feels quicker for me tbh."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62659-anywhere-still-waiting-for-rtr/?do=findComment&comment=614309","commentId":614309,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1333691701,"content":"looks like mstrom has4 in stock"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62659-anywhere-still-waiting-for-rtr/?do=findComment&comment=615134","commentId":615134,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1333906322,"content":" got my dispatched email today"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62659-anywhere-still-waiting-for-rtr/?do=findComment&comment=615240","commentId":615240,"userName":"Drengi","timestamp":1333941931,"content":"I was about to mail maelstrom and complain again about them having them in stock but my pre-order not fulfilled..... but they just dispatched mine!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62659-anywhere-still-waiting-for-rtr/?do=findComment&comment=615278","commentId":615278,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1333955127,"content":"i did mail them, and they replied saying it had been sent- at least we 3 know that neither was left out :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62659-anywhere-still-waiting-for-rtr/?do=findComment&comment=617176","commentId":617176,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1334305680,"content":"I got it tonight!!! Play 5 games! Really dissappointed. So easy to play!!! After KD and RHG this quest is peace of cake. Encounter deck have to many cards about 56 or something. More cards less effective.

Only when you have more then 2 enemies engage you have a chance to get Sleeping sentry but the chance is to small anyway. The quest is really boring and stupid!!! Compare RHG is step back on the quality in my opinion! \n\nI hate this feelings! You wait for pack around 1 month then when you get it play 5 games, win all of them and feel like FFG  lie to you.\n\nWhat i has waiting for???? In PVP game you still get a chance to get strong opponent to make game more cool but here......... Another month of waiting of next quest and then is is also difficult 4 then you again dissappointed. In my opinion all this adventures is cool when they are really adventures, dangerous, dreadfull and exiting. When every decision can cost you a lot and wrong one can bring you down. But when you play and use only half of your brain like a walking in the park is bull. Special for Tolkien game. I think every quest should be much more difficult at least 6 or 7. My favorite is Osgiliath!!! this is a good one.\n\nWhy they cannot make some rules to increase the difficult of the quest by players???I dont wont to make my house rules cose balance is quite fragile.\n\nAnd what about Tournaments system??? They promise it already 1 year before???\n\nSorry i bit upset now!!! Really, really dissappointed with RTR!!!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62659-anywhere-still-waiting-for-rtr/?do=findComment&comment=618819","commentId":618819,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1334676648,"content":"I have actually yet to win this one (probably played about 4 times now).  \n\nEvery time I've either been knocked out by the Sleeping Sentry shadow effect or Orc Ambush returning about 8 Orcs back into play.\n\nI think it's rubbish having a \"game over\" shadow effect.  Poorly designed this one."}]}
