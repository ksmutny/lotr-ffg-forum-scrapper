We were getting pounded and not making any progress. It seems that we were drawing a lot of location cards which required us to spend so much time going to locations which means we're not making progress on the quest. Also, like you, if the scenario starts with a monster in plan and if you draw more, the players will end up taking care of that monster first. We were exhausting our characters just to meet the threat and possible threat each turn that by the end of the defense phase we're unable to do actual damage to characters.\n\nHow did you handle if you had 4 attackers with the same level of threat during the check? There is an Orc with a threat level of 25, we had 4 in play at one point which means we engaged all 4 against the first player because she had a threat of 32, so all went against her."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47637-i-think-i-may-be-clueless/?do=findComment&comment=477594","commentId":477594,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1306840658,"content":"How did you end up with four enemies in the staging area at once?  Not sure if you missed the rule, but enemies stay engaged after a combat round, they do not return.  In any case, if you have multiple foes engaging, you follow the standard rules for engagement checks.  The first monsters goes to player 1, the second (assuming a threat total of 25+) goes to player 2, the third to player 1, the fourth to player 2."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47637-i-think-i-may-be-clueless/?do=findComment&comment=477619","commentId":477619,"userName":"Ulairi","timestamp":1306842838,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nHow did you end up with four enemies in the staging area at once?  Not sure if you missed the rule, but enemies stay engaged after a combat round, they do not return.  In any case, if you have multiple foes engaging, you follow the standard rules for engagement checks.  The first monsters goes to player 1, the second (assuming a threat total of 25+) goes to player 2, the third to player 1, the fourth to player 2.\n\n\n\n \n\nDon't they return to the staging area after the combat round?

That means you've committed two characters to the quest, and still have one to defend and one to attack.\n\nOn top of all that, ALLIES. Lots of them, they can soak damage from the horrendously strong monsters, leaving your heroes free to attack, or they can add to your attack, finishing a creature off- don't forget you can attack with multiple chracters, and teh enemy's defense is only counted once against your combined attack.\n\nIf you're using Spirit solo from the core set, you'll struggle a bit with the monsters, but the Ranger allies can deal with lots of locations, and you can counter shadow/treachery cards and reduce your threat to delay the point when enemies engage you- sometimes even kill them altogether with Dunhere before they attack.\n\n \n\nPersonally, I found the first three or four games really tough, then suddenly things began to click and it got A LOT easier. Stick with it."}]}
