Every time players cennot settle the strategy should be accompanied by The Braking of the Fellowship.\n\n3. Only The Prophecy can be played while shuffling the Encounter Deck.\n\n4. Once one of Your heros is wounded and You suspect it will not survive Shadow effect do You have to start playing Amon Hen.\n\n5. If you play 2 Rohirrim ally cards do you have to play The Ride of the Rohirrim twice?\n\n6. Can You sometimes swap The Gray Havens with Into the West after You beat chain of quests on nightmare difficulty settings.\n\n7. In \"Search for Gollum\" chapter do You have to listen to Gollum's Song over and over again until you find enough clues?\n\nSo Your actual question seems a little bit puny to all of us, who with trembling fingers try to learn to  sing The Steward of Gondor song in preparation to situation when one of the players is eliminated from the game.\n\nSky"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45190-i-am-truly-a-geek/?do=findComment&comment=453202","commentId":453202,"userName":"wyrm187","timestamp":1302698170,"content":"yohko said:\n\n \n\nSadly no, you are not.
