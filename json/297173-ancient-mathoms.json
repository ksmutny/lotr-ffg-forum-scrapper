The White Tower blog has started up another new project, in collaboration with the Card Talk podcast.\n\nBy way of introduction, the project started with me meditating on some of the underpowered cards in the game from the Core Set and early cycles (sparked by a segment or three from Cardboard of the Rings), and wondering what it would take to make them a competitive choice when compared to the full modern card pool. From there, it has grown entirely out of control into a full-blown project to examine every card from the early life of the game, evaluate whether or not the card needs to be boosted in order to put it on even ground in the modern meta, and then offer adjusted versions of those cards. Along the way, if we meet any particularly egregiously overpowered or meta-warping cards, we'll be toning them down just a little bit as well.\n\nWe'll be doing a series of blog posts with accompanying YouTube videos going through each of these cards, in bite size chunks of around 8-12 cards per post/video.\n\nThe first one is already up: Core Set Leadership Cards [https://thewhitetower.wordpress.com/2019/07/05/ancient-mathoms-core-set-leadership/]\n\nWhile the Tactics cards are already finalized, and the video has already been recorded (to be posted Friday), we are still inviting community comment on the Spirit cards from the Core Set."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3735096","commentId":3735096,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1562475996,"content":"For these cards, we ended up workshopping multiple versions that could work out well.

Adding victory points felt like it was a more organic part of the game system, instead of feeling like it was tacked on afterwards to resolve a problem. I fully own that this choice was just me being annoyed though.

I think that I've come around on both unexpected courage and northern tracker being fine as they are.  Both were on my 'maybe' list, and the discussion in the community has been good to settle my thoughts. Earlier in the life of the game, they were more powerful and meta- warping than they are now. But they have become less prevalent - in part because quests have built around them.\n\nTest of will is probably the single most OP card in the game, but I think that it is so powerful that it has shaped the game around it - to such an extent that nerfing it would be incredibly harmful.  Unlike steward of Gondor, or some of the other op cards, there aren't alternatives waiting to see time in the sun. Test of will is so powerful that to this day, it is almost the only card capable of canceling treacheries.\n\nSo, there's that. I still have cards in my list that I feel need to be toned down, and I recognize and respect your difference of opinion in that, and I appreciate your willingness to engage even though you are skeptical of the basic premise.\n\nNow, onto your thoughts on specific cards.\n\nI agree completely on light in the dark, and - barring a convincing wave of community comment that offers good reasons to go the other way - that is where I plan to take it.\n\nOn Lorien Guide, I prefer the more general case as well, although I really like the idea of opening up additional space in the victory display deck. I am still torn on this one - as written, she can also be an interesting boost for side quest decks, Gandalf (flame of Anor), secrecy (out of the wild), and others. But at the end of the day, i think that the Lorien guide ought to be a good card in a celeborn/Galadriel deck, and that points towards the standard silvan version.\n\nFor power in the earth, I also share your preference, just to open up new deckbuilding space. However, I have heard rather significant concerns about it - there are many locations in the game with only 2 threat, and to be able to lock them down with only 1 resource and 1 card is a powerful effect.\n\nI like your proposal for favor of the lady - I'll bring it up with Grant.\n\nMy original Will of the West had no victory points, but i added then after someone offered worries about being able to boost up keen as lances too quickly. I'm not sure how I feel on that subject atm.\n\nAgain, thanks for your feedback.\n\nEdited July 8, 2019 by Onidsen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3736185","commentId":3736185,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1562640554,"content":"I'll grant there's a lot of 2 threat locations, but since you (ordinarily) have to both deal with the 2-threat after its reveal and not travel to it in the travel phase, I don't think locking it down completely is a terrible thing; certainly less powerful than Ranger Spikes with Damrod.  The whole point of Power in the Earth is to keep a location in staging indefinitely, and obviously -1 threat hasn't been enough of an effect to justify doing that.  Making Power in the Earth worth playing is the point, surely?  Even then, with a -2 threat PitE in hand (and not a woodman deck) I'm not sure you'd use it on an ordinary 2-threat location if the encounter deck has other locations, even with higher threat, that have obnoxious travel/active requirements."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3736225","commentId":3736225,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1562648520,"content":"I think the way to think about revising Power in the Earth is as an indirect form of increasing willpower (since there needs to be a location in the staging area for it to work).

Also, if we've altered one which you think didn't need it, tell us that, too!\n\nThere are 2 versions of Self-Preservation - one following our preferred method of adding new abilities instead of changing costs, the other just reducing the cost to be in line with the 2 Daughters of the Nimrodel.\n\nThere are also 2 versions of Beorn's Hospitality. For each, we'd love to hear which one you prefer!\n\nJaAon1p.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/JaAon1p.jpg]\n\nGlorfindel's original ability is just not that impressive. 1 resource to heal 1 damage is not a great deal, especially in the resource-starved Lore sphere. The problem, of course, is that boosting the healing starts competing with Ioreth and other resource-to-healing cards. Our solution was to offer another boost in addition to healing 1 damage.\n\nxU3fMKW.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/xU3fMKW.jpg]\n\nThe Daughter of the Nimrodel is not a bad card. She just happens to be overshadowed by nearly every subsequent healing card in the game. Especially the Warden of Healing, who has a better healing ability *and* costs less. To help deal with this disparity, we reduced the cost on the Daughter and will be increasing the cost on the Warden.\n\nRbvEQSq.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/RbvEQSq.jpg]\n\nSelf-Preservation is a good card, just a little too expensive. The hit point boost might be overpowered, except that we have made Citadel Plate limit 1 per hero, along with this card. So the total amount of hit points you can give to Gloin is still lower than it was before this project, which is as it should be.\n\nJzQkSor.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/JzQkSor.jpg]\n\nThe other option for this card is to leave it the way it was (athough limit 1 per character is just a good idea), and to reduce the cost to 2, bringing it in line with the new Daughter of the Nimrodel.\n\nvpct7mw.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/vpct7mw.jpg]\n\nGandalf's Search was a really difficult one to figure out. We didn't want to step on the toes of Heed the Dream, and I really was hoping to keep the X cost, because I like having those kind of cards in the card pool.\n\nThis is hopefully an elegant solution. For 1 player, it is better than Heed the Dream. In multiplayer, it may or may not be.\n\nAnother option would be to make X the number of players in the game, which would make this equal to Heed the Dream in single player but less comparable in higher player counts.\n\njI4iWYm.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/jI4iWYm.jpg]\n\nAnother too-expensive healing card. For this one, we decided to add additional readying to the Lore sphere, which struggles that way.\n\nCompared with Lembas, it is more expensive. But it does not require a Noldor or Silvan hero, and heals more in the edge cases where you have boosted a character's hit points.\n\nLaRtSbL.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/LaRtSbL.jpg]\n\nCampfire Tales, but on steroids.

thoughts:\n\nGlorfindel: I like this enhancement, the mild stat boost distinguishes him from other pay-to-heal options like Ioreth/Warden/Remedy.  Since it's a phase boost it's ordinarily just a +1, but Herugrim or Golden Shield can take advantage of the multi-boost and I'm fine with that.\n\nDaughter of Nimrodel: Thinking about Daughter vs Warden, I'm struck a little by the claim that Warden's healing ability is better.  Certainly his extra ability sets him apart, and being able to heal a character instead of a hero is huge, but (absent Elrond effects) I'm not convinced that healing a single point in two different characters is better than healing two points in one character.  For archery they're equivalent because you can put damage wherever you want.  For treacheries that ding everybody spreading it out is better.  But for damage from defending, two points is often better.  So which of the two is better is situational.  Most of all, while Warden is the king of two-cost healers, I'm not convinced that he's *overpowered* at two unless his repeat healing ability is being abused.  So maybe instead of making Warden's current healing more expensive to make weaker healers look attractive at two, could we make weaker healers comparable at two or better at three?\n\nIt's also a shame that Nimrodel has no enters play ability, what with her being a Silvan at all.  If she had one, what would it take for Nimrodel to be better at three?  How about something like this:  change Nimrodel to heal 2 damage on any *character*, this makes her different than Warden's base ability, but not inferior -- depending on how you expect damage, you may prefer one or the other, but the base ability is at par.  What about an enters play?  She could do her ability when coming in, but that's essentially like a one-shot Warden repeat, leaving her more expensive (not to mention Galadhrim healer has this thing going already).  Here's an ability that I think would make her worth 3 -- when she enters play, move up to two damage from a character to a non-unique enemy in play.\n\nWhat about at an enter play at 2 cost?  Giving her a free heal for enter play would make her essentially par with a (limit 1 per turn) 2-cost warden -- he can do it more often, but he doesn't get an extra heal for free.  Of course, she's now a much better value than Galadhrim Healer, who probably needs some help in any case.  One option might be to give her an enters-play that doesn't relate to healing at all.  Healer isn't in her name, and while Waters of Nimrodel is a healing card, Lay of Nimrodel gives +willpower to a spirit hero based on resources -- maybe Daughter could ape that event for a lore hero instead (for round instead of phase, since +willpower in planning phase is not very useful).\n\nSelf Preservation -- I like the 3 cost version better.  +2 hp adds the twist that makes this a good value at 3.\n\nGandalf's Search -- The scrying makes it superior to Heed the Dream *if* you don't have 3 leadership resources, which I usually do in decks where I use Heed the Dream.  But it's a different card and is useful at all X costs, I like it.\n\nLore of Imladris -- while it's close to Lembas, allowing it to be played on a character instead of a hero makes this a more general purpose option.\n\nLorien's Wealth -- Turning a card from the core set into Campfire Tales on steroids makes it terrific value for 4-players, which core players probably rarely do, and exactly as useful as the current card for one player, which core players probably commonly do.  How about leaving at choose-a-player-for-3-cards but lowering the cost to 2?  Or maybe increase the cards drawn to 4 or 5?\n\nBeorn's Hospitality -- agree that a major plus needs to be added to the across the board healing to make this event worth 5.  It needs to be a game-changer, and the effects of other 5-cost events (that don't have discounts) reflect that.  The effects you've identified are powerful, I think I prefer the first because it's a powerful effect for a specific player while the second is most beneficial for multi-player and the extra value is contingent on questing heroes.  I'd prefer a grand effect that synergizes with healing damage, but what does healing damage let you do -- take more damage.  But that's something you don't generally want to do, and I'm at a loss what \"extra effect\" actually could be set up by a global heal.  I do have some thoughts, though:\n\n1) Change it to heal all *characters* controlled by a player (up to 5 damage, so Rhosgobel doesn't break).  This is a big expensive healing event, doctor up the allies too.\n\n2) Maybe address the weakness of lore?  Traditionally it's card rich and resource poor.  Beorn's hospitality gets you banged up *and* gives you supplies -- maybe heal up *and* put an attachment into play for no cost?\n\n3) Maybe throw in another stereotypical lore effect, like some scrying (Beorn wasn't just hospitable, he also applied extreme intelligence gathering)?  Add look at the top 5 cards of the encounter deck, place a non-unique card from them in the victory display and put the other four back in any order?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3740020","commentId":3740020,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1563145225,"content":">

That version would still not really useful for solo, though (although I rather suspect that there are use cases with Good Meal that haven't been explored).

I worry about crowding out Waters of Nimrodel (or about Waters crowding out Hospitality), but restricting it to characters of 1 player while also doing something like cancelling attacks would leave the space open.\n\n2 - Ooh, now that is an interesting idea. Much like the change we settled on with Brok Ironfist, where the too-high cost doesn't go away, but if you are using it to bring in an attachment at no cost, that could very easily change the calculus a great deal. A free 4-cost attachment means that you are wiping the board of damage at effectively 1-cost. I think that I might like it even better than the attack cancellation idea. And it could also be a way to get off-sphere attachments into a Lore deck. 5-cost for Sword that was Broken on Loragorn (plus a free heal)? Probably worth it. I'm going to look into that idea quite extensively.\n\n3 - Hmm...that's another option, but I don't think I like that one as much.

I considered moving in that direction, but I also realized that there is a whole noldor sub- archetype based around spending resources for abilities: Glorfindel, Elladan, Elrohir, Gildor Inglorion. Hero Arwen also happens to synergize with both archetypes. So I aimed at trying to make spending the resource more worthwhile. In my own playtesting, I have really enjoyed the stat boost.\n\nI'll probably boost raven wing helm if we ever get to that cycle. (I hope to,  because I want to fix Dori, too) The simplest fix is to add a hit point boost, maybe +1.\n\nOn Dark Knowledge, I left it out explicitly because of the burning brand errata. It's true that the brand pretty much killed this card. But even without the brand errata, it's still very useful in a deck that runs armored destrier or other shadow discard effects. With the errata, it's even good as a complement to the burning brand, letting us know if there is a worse effect to exhaust the brand to cancel.\n\nOn the Daughter, I think I'm going to end up with the following ability, added on top of her existing one (along with a willpower boost?): response - after a character leaves play, place a progress on a location in the staging area.

Instead of looking at the cards by sphere, we're going to take a couple of packs at a time (trying to keep the overall number of cards/video between 8-12, although I can already tell you that that will not be possible for Journey to Rhosgobel + Dead Marshes). Today's packs are The Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at the Carrock!\n\nWe've got 2 different versions of Lore Bilbo to choose from - one that puts his threat right where it should have been from the beginning, and one that gives him an extra ability to try and compensate for the extra threat.\n\nThere are also 2 versions of both the Beorning Beekeeper, the Longbeard Map-maker, and Mustering the Rohirrim. Let us know which version (if any) you like better! If we missed any cards from these 2 packs that you think need a little boost, let us know!\n\nFirst off, Bilbo:\n\nThis version of Bilbo comes to you because if we change the stats on one version of a hero, we are committed to change them on every version of that hero, and there are concerns that lowering the threat of the Tactics version of Bilbo might be too powerful. So what to do instead? Give an extra ability that might make up the difference. In this case, it feels a little like the effect on Sting.\n\nh9pAnrF.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/h9pAnrF.jpg]\n\nShort, simple. Bilbo as he should have been.\n\nYDUv787.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/YDUv787.jpg]\n\nWe had to at least add the Minstrel trait to this card. Once we did, we figured an extra hit point wouldn't be amiss. She still has poor cost-to-stat ratio, but a full deck search for a Song card is still good in the right deck.\n\nXvproyD.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/XvproyD.jpg]\n \nThis version just gets the Map-maker offering 3 cost for 2 willpower, something that might be useful in non-Dwarf decks. The ability is limited to 3 times per phase, just to prevent egregious abuse of it.\n \nWplrKel.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/WplrKel.jpg]\n \nAs the earlier version, but reducing the cost instead of boosting the stats. Now it's got the cost-to-stat ratio of an Erebor Hammersmith, which is pretty good, even with a situational ability.\n \nefskFRi.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/efskFRi.jpg]\n \nThis one we just decreased the cost by 1. Now he's free with Spirit Theoden, and you can recycle him with Guthwine or Gamling if you need to. Even without the cost reduction or Rohan synergies, 1 cost to ready a hero, plus getting a willpower until you need it? That's decent.\n \nT9XBXtx.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/T9XBXtx.jpg]\n \nOne of the things that Rohan needs is more allies that key off of allies getting discarded. Eomund seemed like a good opportunity to do that.\n \nx4kZgl5.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/x4kZgl5.jpg]\n \nOur approach to these trait cards is just going to be having them replace themselves in your hand when you play them. It's not enough to make them stellar, but they exist to enable quirky little shenanigans like giving Cirdan the Shipwright Herugrim and a Golden Shield. And this just makes those a little bit easier.\n \nbizvO3Y.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/bizvO3Y.jpg]\n \nThe first version just turns this event into The Eagles are Coming, but for Rohan. On the positive side, that's a very good event. On the negative side, it's a little boring.\n \nemcrgOZ.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/emcrgOZ.jpg]\n \nThis version instead keeps the searching the top 10 cards, but lets you spend resources to search your whole deck for another Rohan ally. The cost was, of course, reduced to compensate.\n \n6pZcm7G.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/6pZcm7G.jpg]\n \nThis Beekeeper is modelled after the Beorning Guardian. But instead of giving him 3 attack, we gave an extra willpower instead. Now you have to choose whether to quest or to hold him back to attack and use his ability.\n \nvtlc9Bl.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/vtlc9Bl.jpg]\n \nThis was another option we workshopped, because not everyone in our alpha response team liked the other. This turns him into a little bit of a defender, and lets you do some indiscriminate damage when he inevitably dies to a nasty shadow card.\n \nWa12BaY.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/Wa12BaY.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3749047","commentId":3749047,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1564318271,"content":"I always had the impression that Beravor has 6 threat too much, as her action requires exhausting to draw two cards, so Bilbo only has 3 threat more but with the benefit to draw a card and still use his stats.

It is good, that his ability says \"declared as a defender\" instead of \"exhausts to defend\" like on Sting, so it works with Hour of Wrath, orPath of Need. Yet I am not convinced, that it is a good ability. Bilbo is very fragile for a defender without attachments and relying on luck to get a decent defence boost is not what I want on a defending hero. And with limit once per phase, not even A Fast Hitch can do much with his stats.\n\nA second hit point on the Minstrel is a good idea, so she does not die to some treacheries.

Do you have any plans for this?\n\nI prefer the cheaper version of the Map-maker because of Dain's willpower buff. 3 points of willpower on a non-unique ally are only found on Wellinghall Preservers, which at cost of 3 are too cheap in my opinion, even with entering play exhausted.\n\nDo you have plans for Thrór's Map, as it makes Strider's Path rather useless? Sure you also get rid of the revealed card's threat before resolving the quest, but as you possibly swap in the active location, there is hardly a benefit.\n\nI am against lowering the cost on the Horse-breaker, as with Théoden and Gamling you basically have a slightly more complicated version of Unexpected Courage that gives extra willpower. I also think Éomund does not need a buff: 2 willpower for 3 resources is quite normal and for only 2 with his brother-in-law around is really good. And then his normal ability can be abused every round. Of course, Théoden and Gamling can only work with one ally per round. By the way, you talk about \"allies that key off of allies getting discarded\", yet Éomund's response triggers on allies leaving play, e.g. chump blocking.\n\nI am fine with the change to Nor Am I A Stranger, so it becomes more similar to the Harad cycle trait cards. Maybe include limit one per hero as well. I used this card to get another ready out of Éomund and Forth Eorlingas! can be quite impressive as well.\n\nI always wondered why The Eagles are coming! is cheaper than Mustering the Rohirrim and can potentially draw more cards, even though you only dig half as deep into your deck. Copying the former event is quite boring, so i prefer the second version.\n\nI prefer the second version of the Beekeeper, imagining the bees avenging the death of their keeper by swarming all enemies in the vicinity.\n\nBorn(e) Aloft also needs a buff.

Spirit merry, leadership frodo, and folco reduce threat. \n\nMight I suggest, keep the passive card draw and instead of defense: \"when you raise your threat through player card effect, draw x cards where x is the amount of threat raised (limit once per round)\" this lends to synergizing well with Smeagol, the new master cards (utilizing the ring), and some doomed cards.

However, the new Journeys in Middle-Earth boardgame revealed a new FFG-created hero named Elena, an Elven minstrel from Lindon. I expect to see her as a hero in this game at some point, and I rather hope that they'll do something with the Minstrel trait when she gets released. If they do, I want to future-proof this card so it will work with her.

In addition, there are 2 other Dwarf allies that have 2 willpower base for 3 cost (and thus will have 3 willpower with Dain): the Longbeard Elder from the Foundations of Stone pack, and the Erebor Toymaker from the Mount Gundabad pack.\n\nOne of the things I want to do is create space to run a Dwarf deck that doesn't necessarily need Leadership Dain to function well, which is what I was hoping the 3-cost version would help open up. But I guess the real question is \"what should we do with these Dwarf allies given that Dain is going to be nerfed as part of this project?\"\n\nAnd to help facilitate that discussion, I'll just drop a sneak peek of the proposed Dain nerf in the thread:\n\nMmcyfke.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/Mmcyfke.jpg]\n\nIf Dain is getting nerfed as in the above, do you still feel the same way about the Map-maker?\n\n> 17 hours ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> Do you have plans for Thrór's Map, as it makes Strider's Path rather useless? Sure you also get rid of the revealed card's threat before resolving the quest, but as you possibly swap in the active location, there is hardly a benefit.\n\nI hadn't had plans for Thror's Map, but you are the second person I've heard suggest that the Map is overpowered in a way that warps the game in the last couple of days. I'm still unsure of whether or not it needs a change, but if I did do anything to it, I'd probably make it a 0-cost attachment and make it a discard effect. Either that, or give an additional cost - maybe you have to exhaust the hero as well? Or maybe spend a resource? I don't know for sure.\n\nI think that there are use cases for Strider's Path even when Thror's Map exists. Among other things, you can get rid of the obnoxious location on the turn you reveal it - with the Map, you always have to deal with it in the staging area. Against any quest where there are incredibly awful locations that you want to get rid of as soon as possible, it can do a better job than the Map, even if those locations don't have travel costs. 5 locations that I would prefer the path instead of the map, just from a quick Hall of Beorn search, are Gladden Marshlands (from Nightmare Journey Along the Anduin), the Old Ford (from Hunt for Gollum), Hills of Wilderland (from the Rhovanion box set, but it shows up all throughout the cycle), Pitch Black Tunnel (from Beneath the Sands), and Desolate Land (from Crossings of Poros). These are locations that can be absolutely devastating when they come off the deck, so the ability to travel to them (even if you replace the active location) immediately - without having to face a round of failed questing because they showed up - can be incredible.\n\n> 17 hours ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> I am against lowering the cost on the Horse-breaker, as with Théoden and Gamling you basically have a slightly more complicated version of Unexpected Courage that gives extra willpower. I also think Éomund does not need a buff: 2 willpower for 3 resources is quite normal and for only 2 with his brother-in-law around is really good. And then his normal ability can be abused every round. Of course, Théoden and Gamling can only work with one ally per round. By the way, you talk about \"allies that key off of allies getting discarded\", yet Éomund's response triggers on allies leaving play, e.g. chump blocking.\n\nRe: the Horse-breaker, the problem I see is that the card is completely overcosted at 2 resources. I wouldn't run it, even in a Theoden deck (and I have tried - I want to get this card to work, but every single time I take a deck that uses him and do decktesting for it, he eventually gets the cut because he's just not adding enough value.) It's true that Theoden/Gamling can recur hi every single turn for no cost. But if they are doing that, then Theoden isn't using his cost reduction on something else, and Gamling isn't returning Westfold Outrider or Riddermark's Finest or Riddermark Knight, or the Snowbourn Scout that you discarded for Ride to Ruin or Rear Guard or Helm! Helm! It's a complicated combo, all to do something that Unexpected Courage could already do, and for less cost.\n\nOf course, I could give some other benefit instead of reducing the cost. But I think that part of the problem with these early Rohan allies is that they were priced expecting that someone would have the pre-errata Horn of Gondor in play somewhere (probably playing it in the Rohan deck) and thus would be getting a resource back when they were discarded. (Which would effectively have made this card cost 1 anyways). But there are so many Rohan heroes out there, and I want to consider making this card useful outside of just Spirit Theoden decks - or indeed, perhaps even outside of just Rohan decks. At 2 cost, you could maybe pull off a janky combo in a Theoden deck. At 1, you might include him in all sorts of decks.\n\nThat said,\n\nRe: Eomund, you may have a point there. I'm actually more tempted to drop his normal ability and just give him the ready-an-ally ability. The global Rohan ready is a little frustrating - primarily because so few Rohan allies benefit from readying. His best use-case is to ready all the questing Rohan characters, but so few of them have anything else useful that they could do. Many of the heroes have the same problem. I suppose one possibility would be to chump block with him after you have used all your other defenders, and thus get extra actions out of Erkenbrand, Deorwine, or the Wardens of Helm's Deep, but that requires you to not quest with him.\n\nOn the allies-leave-play vs. allies-are-discarded, I wanted to keep him useful even in a Core+Shadows of Mirkwood environment. There aren't a lot of Rohan allies to begin with in that environment, and so few of them get discarded - in general, I don't want to hobble a card by making it only useful in future cycles. Also - the Snowbourn Scout remains the best chump blocker in the game for a long while, and letting Eomund key off of that felt like a fine approach.\n\nRe: Born Aloft - that was a card that was kind of borderline for us. It's not a very useful card most of the time, but some combos key off of returning an ally to your hand to play again, especially as powerful enters-play effects become more common. Among the cards I can think of off the top of my head - Rumil, Galadhon Archer, Marksman of Lorien. Of course, a dedicated Silvan deck will have other ways of doing that, but generic Tactics combat decks might want to run these allies and recur them as well.\n\nBut we'll definitely take a look at it and see if we can improve it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3749434","commentId":3749434,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1564383155,"content":"> 15 hours ago, player3351457 said:\n> \n> For the first version of Bilbo...

But later cards like Errand-rider and Good Harvest end up pushing it out of the modern pool.\n\nSo we just ended up giving it a cantrip ability.\n\nFHqOnbI.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/FHqOnbI.jpg]\n\nThe Escort from Edoras suffered from being effectively a 2-cost event that gave you +4 willpower. The Riddermark Knight, from the Haradrim cycle, gave us a template for how this ally should have been done originally.\n\nWe followed that, making it so that the response to boost his willpower and then discard him is optional. Without it, he's still a 2-cost/2-willpower quester, which is very valuable.\n\nA143LSK.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/A143LSK.jpg]\n\nLandroval is a study in contradictions. He's a 5-cost sentinel ally with an ability that revolves around protecting heroes, but his stats are oriented around attack.\n\nWe attempted to soften that a little bit by giving him ranged. While we were at it, we fixed one of my biggest gripes about this card - that you couldn't use it to get back Tactics Boromir after you discarded him for his second ability.\n\nNot that this makes that second ability *useful*, but it at least allows for more ways to get around the limitation of having to discard a hero.\n\npMAKZAM.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/pMAKZAM.jpg]\n\nTo The Eyrie is a terrible card. 2 cost to bring an ally you just lost back to your hand? Awful.\n\nThis fix stays in-theme with the original card, but getting the ally back into play is much better than getting it back into your hand.\n\nxlScjlK.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/xlScjlK.jpg]\n\nThis version of the card we feel is a lot more balanced, but it's less powerful. Is this a card you'd run in your decks?\n\nJK4k2PJ.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/JK4k2PJ.jpg]\n\nThis version of Haldir is simple - it works with the Silvans, but can also benefit from other allies leaving play. Location control is also something that never goes amiss.\n\ngpSvW0X.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/gpSvW0X.jpg]\n\nThis version of Haldir is a lot more forward-looking. It runs off of our ideas for Mirlonde and a couple of the other Silvan allies, building towards a secrecy Silvan deck.\n\nto6fkya.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/to6fkya.jpg]\n\nAnd here's our current vision for Mirlonde, so you can evaluate which Haldir version you like better.\n\ngXoHbM8.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/gXoHbM8.jpg]\n\nWe just lowered the cost here - honestly, it's not a bad card, it's just hard to put into decks. Hopefully being cheaper will help it.\n\n0eQbWCc.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/0eQbWCc.jpg]\n\nWe gave Radagast a much-needed stat boost. This version also switches out his Creature healing ability for the ability to tutor up a Creature ally when he enters play.\n\nMjVpHvl.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/MjVpHvl.jpg]\n\nThis version of ally Radagast is just the original card with a much-needed stat boost.

Quest: the price change makes this card what it isn't now -- playable.  It's a tremendous bargain since attachments are generally less fragile than allies and would likely elevate the card to staple status.  But that's better than being a coaster.\n\nNathanH's point about 0-cost draw cards is well taken, by inclusion the deck size can effectively shrink even if the card effect itself is worthless.  With that said, We Are Not Idle has been out for ages and the vast, vast majority of users have dwarves -- so the potential problem is really more of a theoretical problem than a practical problem.  But it brings up a larger point -- 0 cost events are currently *not* very popular in general, because their effect is weak (has to be, since free) but it still takes takes up space in the deck.  So you have two choices if making them usable:\n\n1) Making them *truly* free via cantrip.  This can reduce effective deck size, though.\n\n2) Strengthen the effect to make them worth playing at zero.\n\nBut actually, there may be a third choice -- make the card draw conditional rather than unconditional, so the card is only a cantrip if used to do something.  So for We Are Not Idle, it could be \"if you exhausted at least one character [what errata?] draw a card.  And for this card, it could be \"if you transferred at least one resource, draw a card\".  Now you can't play it just to replace it.\n\nAnother possibility is to strengthen via rewording, so instead of saying \"any other hero's resource pool\" it says \"any other heroes' resource pools\", so that Parting Gifts can share the loot *widely*.  Or has Parting Gifts been ruled to allow that already with the current wording?\n\nYou could also produce a narrow buff by substituting character for hero, so that it can be used to buff up Treebeard and Radagast.\n\nEscort for Edoras: I like this change, though it probably makes it the best 2-cost Rohan ally.\n\nLandroval: I like giving him ranged, although other expensive eagles don't even get sentinel.  I think it's odd that they don't given that the cheapest eagles do.  Eagles are highly mobile.\n\nTo the Eyrie: I like this change a lot, it becomes a worthy 2-cost event and an extreme way to heal damaged allies in Tactics.  Rules question -- if your defender of Rammas gets a \"defender takes one damage\" shadow, and you use this event to put him back in play, does he still count as the defender when he returned or is it an undefended attack?  He definitely went out of play, but he's no longer out of play when the attack resolves...\n\nBorne Aloft: I like the intent of the changes, since the big problem with Born Aloft is having to pay for the ally again after taking it out of play.  With the exception of temporary allies and now (thanks to a rules revision) rescuing Vassals/Guardians, that's an expensive zero-cost event.  But turning Born Aloft into a planning-phase cost reducer also seems a bit odd to me, instead of rescuing during the combat phase or something.  Here's my idea -- when used, have it generate cost/2 resources to a hero of your choice.  Then it can subsidy the repay, but also gives the flexibility for some urgent other need paid for by taking back an expensive ally.\n\nif you keep it as \"Born Aloft\" you could change the artwork to a baby Eagle falling through the sky.  (Are Eagles born when the egg is laid, or when they hatch?)\n\nHaldir: location control is always useful, but as an unlimited response it would be super-powerful in a Silvan Deck.  If you're going that way, I'd put a limit on it.  But the idea of Silvan secrecy intrigues me, I think it's a good fit for Silvans sneakily flitting in and out of play.\n\nThe issue I see is that while the Mirlonde above works well with Rossiel and the Silvan discount makes her more useful to Silvan decks, she doesn't actually enable Silvan secrecy.  Mirlonde is at 8, Rossiel is 8, everyone else is at 9 or above, and that means the floor is 22 for the all-Silvan deck.  You could fix this by having Mirlonde give -1 threat to Lore *and* -1 threat to Silvan as separate effects, that would make Mirlonde an enabler for secrecy decks, and allow Mirlonde/Rossiel to make an all-Silvan secrecy deck with anyone but Celeborn.\n\nInfighting's current issue is the lack of enemies with significant damage to move from.  If there's significant damage, it's worth one -- if there's not, it's not worth the deck space, and your version weakens the effect by specifying non-unique.  Amicus' suggestion to gather from all enemies is a good one, though again the non-unique qualifier takes out a use case where the card currently *is* useful, dinging a non-immune boss.  How about a compromise where you can move from up to three enemies, but it doesn't have to be unique?  That prevents mass-Thalin from taking out a boss instantly, but keeps it useful in the current case.\n\nRadagast's healing is so generally useless that the first version is more useful despite being a one-time effect.  But the healing is so thematic, on the rare occasion when you have a creature to heal, and it gives Radagast something to do with his resources.  How about keeping the healing and adding another resource sink, like spending 2 to ready a creature like Treebeard does.\n\nAlternately, since there's a bunch of creatures with leave play, give him a response to a creature leaving play that lets him pay full cost to put that creature back in play immediately.\n\nIt'd be nice if Radagast had an ability that synergized with Wizard Pipe, but having a creature that synergizes with it (Messanger Raven) is close enough."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3760542","commentId":3760542,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1565460423,"content":"I

It also works in the Quest phase with Hirgon, or in the Combat Phase with Thranduil. Or if there's an event you want to use in the combat phase, it's a decent cost reducer for then.\n\nBut the directly adding resources makes it more flexible, and I like that - but I do worry that it would conflict with the space of Elf Guide.

I'd worry about an ability that would allow Mirlonde to reduce starting threat by 6, though (Mirlonde, Rossiel, Haldir or Argalad, for a starting threat of 16 - equal to a Hobbit deck with Folco).\n\nBut the overall thrust of your point is well-taken. It would be good to be able to get a Silvan secrecy deck going (and one that doesn't use Spirit Glorfindel as a crutch). Perhaps dropping Mirlonde's defense and lowering her threat to 6 might be enough. Then, she's undercosted by 1 and also drops threat even further. This also gets you an all-Silvan deck starting at 20 (with Thranduil, even!), although it does lock you into using Rossiel.

Restricted.\n\nResponse: After a character leaves play, exhaust Horn of Gondor to add one resource to the attached hero's resource pool.\n\nAction: Exhaust Horn of Gondor and raise your threat by 1 to give an enemy engaged with you -1 Attack until the end of the round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3762209","commentId":3762209,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1565698184,"content":"Then rebuild it as you think it has to be, it is a better option!\n\n1) Even if it is a useful card, HoG as per raw is as un thematic as it can get.

We just gave him the Warrior trait, and that was mostly because we had restricted Blade Mastery to the Warrior trait.\n\ng5Qdwc4.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/g5Qdwc4.jpg]\n\nThe second is Support of the Eagles - we added the Eagle trait so that it can be drawn with The Eagles Are Coming. Watching and listening to old commentary about the game during this cycle, I have heard a number of complaints that this card couldn't be drawn. While we were in the cycle, then, we decided to address that.\n\nzppWIUI.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/zppWIUI.jpg]\n\nThe third is Meneldor's Flight - as a 0-cost event, we just made it cantrip; our default approach to bad 0-cost events. Recent rules changes gave it a new lease on life, and the card draw is still conditional upon pulling an eagle back to your hand.\n\nTkfTkv3.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/TkfTkv3.jpg]\n\nSong of mocking is a bit niche, but we brought it in line with the Song of Earendil - with which it shares a number of thematic parallels.\n\n0o9o9xQ.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/0o9o9xQ.jpg]\n\nQvUD7kL.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/QvUD7kL.jpg]\n\nThe fifth and sixth cards are just cost reductions. The Dunedain Cache suffered from Early Game Ranged Overcosted Syndrome (every ranged effect in the early game was overcosted - the designers overestimated just how valuable it was). And the Dunedain Watcher suffered from Early Game Overcosted Leadership Ally syndrome - she's a fine card, just a little too expensive to consistently use a discard effect.\n\nSo, with that out of the way, there are 10 cards left that we made more in-depth changes to.\n\nWe'll take them in sphere order:\n\n7iwka2S.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/7iwka2S.jpg]\n\nDain Ironfoot was on our nerf list, for sure. Whenever anyone asks about overpowered cards, he pretty well tops the list of them. Our nerf is not heavily intrusive - it just forces you to choose between using the willpower boost or the attack boost each round. Readying can get around that, of course, but Unexpected Courage is limit one per hero, now, so you'll have to get creative.\n\n6dfof1D.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/6dfof1D.jpg]\n\nKeen-eyed Took is another one I'm just not satisfied with. We played with the idea of having him scry the encounter deck instead of the player's decks, and that might not be an awful idea, because I'm not sure if I like this one\n\nYXIkm7v.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/YXIkm7v.jpg]\n\nDawn Take you All is a card that I keep forgetting exists. Leadership has had a lot of shadow mitigation for a long time, it's just been too expensive (Watcher) or not generally useful enough. The big problem with this card is that it requires each player to be engaged with an enemy to be useful. Allowing each player to discard a shadow card from any enemy removes that roadblock. Now you can ensure a shadow-free or mostly shadow-free round of combat for just 2 resources. Doesn't scale down well to solo play, but not every card needs to.\n\nxK9YwBb.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/xK9YwBb.jpg]\n\nRear Guard is a card I've wanted to like for a long time. In a 4-player game, I feel like it might be able to pull its weight, but the style of deck for which it was designed doesn't fit very well with the current meta, honestly. We don't like our allies to leave play, these days - instead we want to keep them around and boost them up with attachments. Not a problem, it just makes cards like this harder to play. To help it out, we expanded the targets of the WP boost to all unique characters. Ditch a Snowbourne Scout or Squire of the Citadel for +4-6 wp or more? Definitely worthwhile.\n\nBTdjyaE.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/BTdjyaE.jpg]\n\nDescendent of Thorondor finally got a day in the sun again with the rise of Hirgon decks, and even later with Radagast. But he's still ridiculously expensive for his effect. Reducing his cost was a move towards seeing him in other dedicated Tactics decks, but we also broadened the list of targets he can damage to any enemy in play. This lets you kill off enemies engaged with players, which is a huge improvement.\n\nqC0o4QO.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/qC0o4QO.jpg]\n\nThe Riddermark's Finest received a subtle but important change. We removed the requirement to exhaust it to trigger its ability, so you can actually use those stats now. 2 progress still isn't perhaps the best trade-off for discarding an ally, but I've used even the current ally to decent effect. This version lets me quest with it as well.\n\njtEVdFe.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/jtEVdFe.jpg]\n\nRide to Ruin received probably the biggest boost out of this set. This new version has its origins in the thematic disappointment of the original card. Taking the epic moment of the charge of the Rohirrim onto the Pelennor Fields and reducing it to 3 progress on a location is a little bit of a letdown. We allowed you to choose either 3 progress on the location or 3 damage on an enemy. It's a very powerful card now, but hopefully balanced by the fact that you have to discard an ally to make it work. So it's not really 1 cost for 3 damage, it's 1 cost and losing an ally for 3 damage.\n\n8yz4kKs.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/8yz4kKs.jpg]\n\nWe Do Not Sleep is a classic example of a 5-cost event that is never worth the resources you'd spend on it. We wanted to broaden the use case a little, but we also recognized that it needed a cost reduction. Instead of actually changing the cost, we ended up reducing the cost by 1 for each Rohan hero you control. We also restricted the effect to heroes, but we also made it affect all heroes in play. So, for 2 resources, you get a turn in which you can use the heroes for questing and combat without using up any other readying effects they might have had.\n\nr4sTR1e.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/r4sTR1e.jpg]\n\nMirkwood Runner is a card I'm excited for. Along with ally Haldir and Mirlonde, this card hopefully constitutes a new archetype for Silvans: secrecy/victory display. The Runner needed a boost - 2 attack ignoring defense is not great on its own, and being in the Lore sphere, it's hard to boost the attack. You can do a convoluted combo with Rivendell Bow followed by Bow of the Galadhrim, but that's hard to set up. So we gave it a situation where it can get extra attack, if you build for it.\n\nXvGsfIF.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/XvGsfIF.jpg]\n\nOur last card is Rumour from the Earth. I'm not totally satisfied with this card either - it's a repeatable scrying effect, which means that it competes with Henamarth Riversong. Our current appraoch is to dig deeper into the deck with our scrying, but I'm not 100% sure about how I feel about that.\n\nWe'd appreciate any comments on these cards, and on whether or not we missed a card in our earlier playthroughs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3765100","commentId":3765100,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1565989306,"content":"Here's an alternate version of KET:\n\n4OIbuGt.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/4OIbuGt.jpg]\n\nI think I like this one better - it gives Leadership access to a little bit of encounter deck scrying, which pairs well with the Longbeard Elder from the next cycle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3765192","commentId":3765192,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1565998987,"content":"> 2 hours ago, Onidsen said:\n> \n> Here's an alternate version of KET:\n> \n> 4OIbuGt.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/4OIbuGt.jpg]\n> \n> I think I like this one better - it gives Leadership access to a little bit of encounter deck scrying, which pairs well with the Longbeard Elder from the next cycle.\n\nI'm not sure this card does what you think it does. \"Reveal\" has a very specific meaning in this game - something you want to avoid, usually 😝."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3765202","commentId":3765202,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1566000096,"content":"> 17 minutes ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> I'm not sure this card does what you think it does. \"Reveal\" has a very specific meaning in this game - something you want to avoid, usually 😝.\n\nThank you!

cards for the griefer deck!\n\nMy take:\n\nMirlonde -- the -3 threat for only Silvans opens up Silvan secrecy nicely without requiring Rossiel.  I like it.\n\nTaBrand -- like Warrior on him, though it'd be nice if Dale had a powerful ranged weapon.  I don't know how badly he's underrated in multiplayer, I liked him a lot paired with a Three Rings deck.  But his ability really is useless in solo.  While card text is a problem, I wish he had the ability to choose some  benefit to his own side (obviously not readying himself) instead of readying another party's character -- that way it would still benefit partner decks that can't use post-attack exhaustions and also provide a solo use case in conjunction with the thematic Great Yew Bow.\n\nSupport of the Eagles -- yes, it's annoying when the eagle search card doesn't pick up this card, though it is extremely powerful.\n\nI like Meneldor's Flight -- even now that it's useful for Vassal/Guardian rescue, it's still weak, and I like the cantrip-if-you-do-something approach for weak 0-costers.\n\nAdding the card draw to Song of Mocking makes it cheap insurance while replacing itself, but it still is niche.  I think this would be more useful if it was a response to take another character's damage (exhausting the attachment) rather than an action to plan for a heroes' damage in advance.\n\nDunedain Cache deserves the 1 cost and the Signal trait.\n\nDunedain Watcher at 2 is useful outside game-ending-shadow quests, and not underpriced.\n\nLeDain's nerf doesn't just force you to choose between WP boost and attack boost -- it forces you to choose between WP boost, attack boost and defense, where the current LeDain only forces a choice between defense and attack boost.  I'd hate this as an official nerf, but there's no question he's still powerful even with the exhaustion and limits.\n\nKeen-Eyed Took I like the second version better (with the \"reveal\" changed to look, of course).  And it does help out Longbeard Elder.  At the same time, discards from the deck have a mining synergy, except that the cost (returning a 2-cost ally to hand) is disproportionate to the benefit involved (in the printed card, nothing but discarding).  The first version doesn't improve the discarding, just makes the enters play stronger to give recycling intensive.  So I thought -- what if he mines?  Each player discards the top card to return to hand, choose a player to get resources equal to the discarded card.  It has to be a 3+ cost to make a profit over the original KET, but the enter plays helps you not discard blind.  Just an idea, and since he's not a dwarf it's not thematic.\n\nIf I were working from his name and not his current stats/ability, I'd make Keen-Eyed Took a 2-cost, 2-attack hobbit who is parallel to Curious Brandybuck -- a response to enter play free under any player's control when you engage an enemy, but a forced effect to bottom of deck when an engaged enemy of the controlling player is destroyed.\n\nDawn Take You All -- agreed that this wording is better, but it's still not a compelling card even in multiplayer.  Consider that it's competing with Dunedain Watcher -- in four player, with four enemies, you can ensure a shadow free round (outside a few special cases), but you're doing it blind.  Of those four discarded shadows, probably two had shadow effects and they might be manageable ones.  For the same cost, you can put Dunedain Watcher in play and get the benefit of her stats until a shadow comes along that *really* needs cancelling.  And that's four player -- at 2-player the Watcher is vastly better and at 1 the Watcher is ridiculously better.  I don't think this card is forgotten just because it's obscure, I think it's forgoteen because it's way too expensive for what it does.  How to make it a useful card without making it Hasty Stroke?\n\nOne possibility is to remove the \"facedown\".  Out of all the zillions of shadow card affectors, only Jubyar, this and Eldahir want you to lose your Silver Lamp.  I think that's annoying.  But that by itself does nothing except make it more useful in a rare combo.  In the general case you're playing twice as much to discard facedown card(s).\n\nAnother possibility is to drop the blind -- for 2 cost, you get to turn every facedown shadow face-up, *then* discard exactly one shadow.  Then each other player may pay one resource to discard a shadow.  I think the reveal fits with \"Dawn Take You All\" thematically.\n\nRear Guard is better, and sacrificing an ally could get a huge boost in 3-4 player.  I think I'd pay 2 for the effect (not in solo) if it returned to hand instead of getting discarded.\n\nI like the improved Thorondor, even with Radagast the cost and limitation on damage is hard to take in the current model.\n\nRiddermark's Finest -- good change.  Having to exhaust seriously impairs the current card's value.\n\nRide to Ruin -- the damage ramps up the power, but mostly because 3 damage is more powerful than 3 progress.  I think the median progress needed for a location in most cycles is four, and I don't think that would be overpowered.\n\nWe Do Not Sleep -- I love the cost reduction for the effect, but the redefinition to heroes saddens me a bit -- the \"we\" is seriously constricted and undramatic -- costing a good reason to play Mutual Accord, sniff sniff.  The big problem with the event isn't just the cost, it's that most Rohirrim aren't actually good at both questing and fighting, heroes included.\n\nI'd keep the thematic discount, but keep the restriction to Rohan characters -- but also give +1 wp/+1 attack to all unique Rohan characters until end of the round.  Now they're worth double duty and the Mutual Accord combo becomes epic.\n\nMirkwood Runner -- agreed it's hard to ramp and none of the new ally attachments helps much.  The best elf attachment is worthless because he already ignores defense.  What he really needs to shine is the warrior trait, so he doesn't need two attachments for a measily 1-attack increase.  (Other combos besides the two bows -- I am Not a Stranger + Speak of the Mark; In Service of the Steward + Sword of Morthond + Knights of the Swan.  And have a companion deck dump more Knights of Swan that you grab with Stand and Fight until he takes trolls down with impunity.  Totally worth ten turns of setup.)\n\nAnother idea to ramp him up is allowing the Runners to combine *with each other*, so they ignore defense if only Mirkwooed Runners are attacking -- multiples then become more dangerous.\n\nBut the idea of ramping him up with victory display?  I like the idea of ramping up *somebody's* attack with VD cards, but I've got to say that his ability coupled with 4 attack strikes me as *very* powerful.  Whether it's too powerful is quest dependent; I almost want +1 attack with a shared trait or +2 attack with a shared name, but that probably wouldn't fit on the card.\n\nRumour from the Earth -- yes, the repeatable aspect of it does compete with Hennamarth -- and lose, because paying 1 lore resource once is much better than paying one every turn.  I'm not sure the non-repeatable but still not very compelling version is going to see much traction either.  With the name deep scrying seems appropriate, but how to distinguish (especially at zero cost) between it and Risk Some Light and Interrogation?\n\nPerhaps it could be more like some other top-card queries (Ravens of the Mountains and Needful to Know) and trigger something off the top card's threat?  Card draw hasn't been done yet.\n\nOr maybe key off something else.  Keep it zero cost, but require exhaustion of a scout to examine the top X cards of the encounter deck, where X is the threat of the active location.  You may choose one card to put at the bottom of the deck, then put the rest back in any order.  Simple, useful, thematic.\n\nDid you consider doing anything to Shadow of the Past?  I'd like it more if it gave a choice of putting the top discard on top of the encounter deck, or shuffling any card in the discard back into the deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3765706","commentId":3765706,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1566101265,"content":"Thank

I'd honestly rather give KET 1 WP and 1 attack instead of 2 attack, because an ally you could play for free to get 4 attack with Tom Cotton would be rather overpowered, I think. I like the parallel between that and the curious brandybuck, though. I'm torn between the encounter scrying version and having that parallel (though oddly enough, the Facebook group prefers the one that just adds a card to a player's hand).

Although I don't think I'd make other players pay resources to discard shadows - turning cards faceup and then having each player choose and discard one would not be overpowered, I think. Not for an event. Still not great in solo, but it suddenly becomes much more worth it even in 2 player.\n\n> On 8/16/2019 at 8:44 PM, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Ride to Ruin -- the damage ramps up the power, but mostly because 3 damage is more powerful than 3 progress.  I think the median progress needed for a location in most cycles is four, and I don't think that would be overpowered.\n\nThis is definitely true, although I really like having the symmetric number of damage or progress, and 4 damage would definitely be too much. I'm not particularly concerned about making both effects equally powerful - both will be useful at some points in a game, and you might choose the less powerful effect because it is most useful *right now.*\n\n> On 8/16/2019 at 8:44 PM, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> We Do Not Sleep -- I love the cost reduction for the effect, but the redefinition to heroes saddens me a bit -- the \"we\" is seriously constricted and undramatic -- costing a good reason to play Mutual Accord, sniff sniff.  The big problem with the event isn't just the cost, it's that most Rohirrim aren't actually good at both questing and fighting, heroes included.\n> \n> I'd keep the thematic discount, but keep the restriction to Rohan characters -- but also give +1 wp/+1 attack to all unique Rohan characters until end of the round.  Now they're worth double duty and the Mutual Accord combo becomes epic.\n\nThat's a good point which I didn't think about - I'm excited to get to some of those Heirs of Numenor cards. The willpower boost might be too much (especially with Astonishing Speed), but an attack boost might definitely be in order - Rohan doesn't have a good general boost like that (although Charge of the Rohirrim works for heroes).\n\n> On 8/16/2019 at 8:44 PM, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Mirkwood Runner -- agreed it's hard to ramp and none of the new ally attachments helps much.  The best elf attachment is worthless because he already ignores defense.  What he really needs to shine is the warrior trait, so he doesn't need two attachments for a measily 1-attack increase.  (Other combos besides the two bows -- I am Not a Stranger + Speak of the Mark; In Service of the Steward + Sword of Morthond + Knights of the Swan.  And have a companion deck dump more Knights of Swan that you grab with Stand and Fight until he takes trolls down with impunity.  Totally worth ten turns of setup.)\n> \n> Another idea to ramp him up is allowing the Runners to combine *with each other*, so they ignore defense if only Mirkwooed Runners are attacking -- multiples then become more dangerous.\n> \n> But the idea of ramping him up with victory display?  I like the idea of ramping up *somebody's* attack with VD cards, but I've got to say that his ability coupled with 4 attack strikes me as *very* powerful.  Whether it's too powerful is quest dependent; I almost want +1 attack with a shared trait or +2 attack with a shared name, but that probably wouldn't fit on the card.\n\nFor reference, here's what the Mirkwood Runner would look like with your proposed text:\n\nvjVSQfn.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/vjVSQfn.jpg]\n\nIt's quite full, as you intuited (possibly too full?).\n\nNow, as to power. The problem with Mirkwood Runner is that it is so difficult to boost his attack. You can get 1 attack on the round it enters play from Celeborn, and there are some janky attachment combos you've mentioned already (and probably some you haven't). But none of them are consistent, and without consistency, it's a 2-attack attacker who has anti-incentives with other attackers.\n\n4 attack, ignoring defense, is very powerful - enough to one-shot a large fraction of the enemies in the game (interestingly enough, it is the same fraction of enemies which can be eliminated by Gandalf's direct damage effect - from personal experience, that fraction grows to be not nearly enough somewhere around Heirs of Numenor).\n\nOn the other hand, it requires a bit of setup - either a lucky draw with our new version of Mirlonde, or with Out of the Wild or Scout Ahead. Or it requires being able to defeat an enemy with the right trait and then playing None Return. (Or, in extremis, defeating an enemy with victory points, though that isn't reliable). I think that it will fall to playtesting to determine whether or not it's too much. (If you're interested, I can provide our working OCTGN files via PM).\n\n> On 8/16/2019 at 8:44 PM, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Rumour from the Earth -- yes, the repeatable aspect of it does compete with Hennamarth -- and lose, because paying 1 lore resource once is much better than paying one every turn.  I'm not sure the non-repeatable but still not very compelling version is going to see much traction either.  With the name deep scrying seems appropriate, but how to distinguish (especially at zero cost) between it and Risk Some Light and Interrogation?\n> \n> Perhaps it could be more like some other top-card queries (Ravens of the Mountains and Needful to Know) and trigger something off the top card's threat?  Card draw hasn't been done yet.\n> \n> Or maybe key off something else.  Keep it zero cost, but require exhaustion of a scout to examine the top X cards of the encounter deck, where X is the threat of the active location.  You may choose one card to put at the bottom of the deck, then put the rest back in any order.  Simple, useful, thematic.\n\nI like that last one - Exhaust a scout or ranger character to look at the top X cards, where X is the (printed) threat of the active location. Of course, that can get a little crazy in Nightmare, with locations like Gladden Marshlands. Or even in quests like Into the Pit, with its 7-threat starting location.\n\nOn the other hand, there are only 14 non-unique locations with more than 4 threat in the non-nightmare game (I don't worry about unique locations, by their nature they aren't consistent.) But even 4 threat means rearranging the top 4 cards of the encounter deck - that's very powerful. It might be worth making it 1 cost for that effect.\n\n> On 8/16/2019 at 8:44 PM, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Did you consider doing anything to Shadow of the Past?  I'd like it more if it gave a choice of putting the top discard on top of the encounter deck, or shuffling any card in the discard back into the deck.\n\nWe talked about it, but our consensus was that it probably didn't need a boost - 2 cost to ensure that your next encounter card is a softball is almost like a cheaper Gildor's Counsel, and useful in solo as well.

One of our goals is to make a Dwarf deck without LdDain viable. To do that, we've got to boost the usefulness of at least some of the Dwarf allies (especially in the willpower department).\n\n> On 8/19/2019 at 10:42 AM, Yepesnopes said:\n> \n> The problem with most Dwarf allies is that without Dain’s buff they are overpriced and bad. They have too little from what matters (willpower, attack, and defence), and too much from what it typically does not matter, hit points.\n\nThat certainly is the common perception, although I'm not 100% sure that this is true. I've been going over Dwarf allies recently, and with the exception of a few stinkers, they really are decent. They just don't have a lot of willpower to offer.\n\nHere's the list of Dwarf allies:\n\n\n\nErebor Hammersmith - really good value-for-cost. 2 cost only gets you 1 in each of the stats, but the recursion + the 3 hit points makes him really good. He can defend against an attack of 3 and survive; not bad.\n\nMiner of the Iron Hills - not a good ally on its own. However, Condition removal is gold in some quests, so I give him a bit of a pass. You're not including him in a deck for his stats.\n\nVeteran Axehand - 2-cost, 2-attack on a Tactics ally. This is excellent value, the gold standard of allies. It should be noted, however, that you only expect 2-cost for 2-stats in the sphere that specializes in it. 2-cost for 2 attack is standard in Tactics and found only rarely in other spheres. 2-cost for 2-willpower is standard in Spirit, and again is a rare commodity in the other 3 spheres.\n\nZigil Miner - his stat-to-cost is actually about right, but it's spread out in an annoying way. But lets be honest, you include him for his ability to get you resources, and you'd use him even if he had no stats at all.\n\nErebor Record Keeper - 1 cost for 1 stat + a useful ability? He's good\n\nSpirit Bofur - 3 cost for 2 willpower is a bit overcosted for spirit, but his ability to get him in for 1 cost is excellent. That's more 2 willpower for 1-cost, really, and that's value that's only matched by the Silvan Refugee, and she comes with a huge drawback.\n\nTactics Bofur - In contrast to his spirit version, 3 cost for 2 willpower is exactly on-point for the Tactics sphere. Only one Tactics ally in the whole game gets a better deal there, and ally Pippin is incredibly valuable.\n\nLongbeard Orc-slayer - this is just an overpriced ally. On the other hand, the Ancient Mathoms project touched him up, and he's now effectively 2 cost for 2 attack, plus damaging Orcs when he enters play. That's what you expect.\n\nFili and Kili - Individually, each of these allies are horrendously overpriced. But because playing one of them gets you the other, you end up with a discount for the stats. Effectively, it's 3 cost for 2 willpower or 2 attack, but you can split it up any way you need to. And global buffs multiply that value incredibly - even without Dain, just having the Arkenstone in play makes these 2 incredibly useful.\n\nErebor Battle-master - Even after the second nerf, he's still really good. 3 cost for 5 attack is unparalleled except by Booming Ents.\n\nAlly Gimli is a standard 4-cost 2/2/2/3 ally, but his readying ability makes him really good. He's straight up value - quest for 2 and then defend with 2/3 + Sentinel, plus access to all the Dwarf or Warrior defensive options. I can't complain about him.\n\nLongbeard Elder is 3-cost for 2 willpower, which is better than all but a few leadership allies in general, unique or no. (Rosie Cotton, ally Merry, and then Halfast Gamgee and Gloin, who are still 3 cost but get you money back, plus maybe Ingold under optimal circumstances). As a 2-willpower quester in Leadership, he's good. His ability is a little tricky, and I think it's fun but not powerful. But even if you never trigger the ability, he's 2 willpower with some hit points to back it up, and outside of Spirit I think that that's worth 3 cost.\n\nLongbeard Map-Maker has been discussed in this thread before. Our change makes him 2-willpower. I think he's much more playable now.\n\nThe Ered Luin Miner is just bad value, but you aren't intending to actually play him. (I don't know if he needs a buff or if mining in general needs something - but even as a free ally he's hard to get excited about unless global buffs are online).\n\nDori is 3 cost for 2 attack in Lore, but also has a unique and useful ability. Decent attacker (probably unnecessary if you're running Tactics, but otherwise he's good).\n\nBifur is much like Dori, but even better. 2-cost for 2-attack plus a 1-cost event that draws you 2 cards, all rolled into a single ally? Pretty good, even if I often do end up questing with him.\n\nDwarven Sellsword is incredible value up front from which you get increasingly diminished returns.\n\nAzain - 3 cost, 3 attack. Good value.\n\nErebor Guard (and let's throw ally Dwalin in here at the same time, because he has effectively the same stat line) - a cheap ally who defends for 2 with 3 hit points, and access to Ring Mail etc. 2 cost (for the Guard, plus some mining support), or 1 cost (for Dwalin, which is insane value). Not a problem here.\n\nGloin is effectively 1 cost for 2 willpower (if you have 3 resources to pay for him upfront), which is incredible.\n\nThe Veteran of Nanduhirion is 4 cost for 3 attack, which is a little bit weak, but he has decent stats for a 4-cost ally, he's just overshadowed by Azain, the Battle Master, and the Veteran Axehand. (We'll be helping him out a bit).\n\nEred Nimrais Prospector - 2 cost for not a lot of stat value, but that recursion...  This ally probably belongs on the list of \"not worth the cost for the stats, but if you are going to use the ability, he's phenomenal.\"\n\nLongbeard Sentry - another phenomenal defender. This time 3 cost, but effectively 3 defense and Sentinel?\n\nBlue Mountain Trader - this is another utility ally who happens to have a point of willpower too. His ability is fine.\n\nBrok Ironfist - ridiculously overcosted, and never worth playing. Of course, he got some help from this project, and now might actually be worth it? Haven't tested him yet, so I'm not 100% sure, but he now brings in a free Dwarf ally when he is played from your hand (discard from the top of your deck until you find one), so you could easily be only paying net 2 or 3 for him, which is worth it.\n\nAlly Bombur is awful, no two ways about it (unless you are playing a quest with Underground or Mountain locations, in which case he's phenomenal)\n\nSoldier of Erebor is 5-cost, but totally worth it if you can manage to get the resources together (which our updated We Are Not Idle should help with)\n\nAnd the Erebor Toymaker is effectively 1 cost for 2 willpower. (Not really, for the same reason Gloin isn't, but 3 cost for 2 willpower and a 2-cost attachment you were going to play anyways is really good).\n\n\n\nSo, from my perspective, the problem isn't that the Dwarf allies aren't worth it individually. Nor is it that their cost is sunk into stats like Hit Points that just aren't useful. The trait is a *little* biased towards defenders, but the big problem is that it's hard to ramp willpower. (Not that difficult for attack, unless you deliberately skip the Tactics sphere - Veteran Axehand, Erebor Battle-master, and Azain Silverbeard are all cost-effective attackers). The vast majority of the allies come in at the 3-cost mark. For almost all of them, each ally is worth the investment, but you can't build a deck with all 3-cost allies. You need some cheaper allies to work your board state up to the 3-cost ones. But for Dwarves, those 2-cost and 1-cost allies are mostly utility allies who aren't particularly stat-efficient. Zigil Miner and Blue Mountain Trader and Ered Nimrais Prospector...just don't cut it. (The Hammersmith does, but he is also the stereotypical focus-on-hit-points-too-much ally, and may actually be the source of the perception that the Dwarf allies have).\n\nAnd you can't cover that lack of willpower ramping with heroes, because the heroes don't have that much willpower either (except Thorin). The best you're going to get is 5 or 6 willpower on turn 1, and it's hard to find good 2-drops to boost that up. Once you can afford 3-drops, you are in business, but it's getting there that is the big problem. It's the same problem that Gondor has. Global boosts like Dain help fill in those gaps, but that makes you reliant on the global boost.\n\nEven with our tweaks, I don't know if this is enough to make Dwarf decks without Dain playable - we may need to alter some dwarf heroes to get extra willpower. (Oin maybe gaining +1 willpower and +1 attack when you control 5 dwarves?) On the other hand, resource engines like hero Gloin, Thorin, and our to-be-fixed We Are Not Idle might be enough to make those 3-drops easy enough to handle.\n\nDrhSFgy.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/DrhSFgy.jpg]\n\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3769390","commentId":3769390,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1566541730,"content":"I seem to have messed up my spoiler tags, and the edit function isn't getting them right.\n\nHere's the commentary that was supposed to be outside of the spoiler tag (for people who don't want to read through me analyzing every Dwarf ally in the game).\n\nSo, from my perspective, the problem isn't that the Dwarf allies aren't worth it individually.

Stepping into Vigilant Guard's space was one of the biggest things I was worried about. But I think that there's still niches for each. Valiant Warrior has the hit point boost, as you noted, and can also save any character (it's particularly valuable for saving 1-hit point questing allies, or preventing \"deal 1 damage to the defending character\" from murdering your chump blockers/Defenders of Rammas). Song of Mocking takes all the damage but only works on heroes, and only once per round.\n\nI'm going back and forth on We Do Not Sleep. You are absolutely right about there not being many Rohan allies that are good at both questing and combat (and the ones that are tend to already have readying effects built in. On the one hand, 2 cost for global action advantage plus an attack boost is insanely good. At least on paper, when compared to, say, Grim Resolve or Strength of Arms (or For Gondor, for that matter). But when you look at the Rohan allies that are getting the action advantage, it looks a lot less attractive.\n\nI think I'm going to put it in as +1 attack for each Rohan character (Doesn't help the Tactics allies who can't quest, but it does boost battle questing, which could be a fun niche case), and then see how it feels in playtesting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3771560","commentId":3771560,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1566841346,"content":"@Onidsen [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/294647-onidsen/]The tactics allies still can quest with Astonishing Speed, Faramir or Sword that was broken, whereas the only attack boost for the spirit allies is For Gondor!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3771846","commentId":3771846,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1566859905,"content":"The second version of Rumour from the Earth addresses a weak spot in Lore and in that respect has some use.  But I don't like it -- thematically I want this card to be a scrying card, and just looking at the top card doesn't scratch that itch for me.\n\nBut what about the first version?  I don't think it's usable.  It's true that as a deep scryer Rumour from the Earth competes with Double Back, Risk Some Light, and Interrogation, all Lore cards -- but having different ways to scry in Lore doesn't bother me, and the other scryers have different effects and different qualifications:\n\nDouble Back is limit 1 per deck, requires side-quest complete, looks at 5-8 cards (4+# players), puts one in victory display and reorders the other four.  It's most commonly used in Victory Display decks, the deep view and reordering is just a bonus -- and since side-quest completion is during the quest phase, the view is prior to combat.\n\nRisk Some Light looks at a fixed 3 cards, but at 3 cost with a Secrecy 3 discount, is not used at all outside secrecy decks.  It can put one to bottom and reorder the other two.  That's the effect I borrowed for my suggested version, only with a different card count.  It can be played in any phase.\n\nInterrogation looks at X cards (trapped enemy's threat), but costs 1.  It may discard one but doesn't alter order.  As an action it can be done anytime, except that you need a trapped enemy;

I still maintain that the card is perfectly fine as it is, but the opportunity to fix a number of quests with objectives that are annoyingly easy to lose is enough to make the change worthwhile.\n\nAnd now, to the big topic.\n\nRumor from the Earth. First off - you are absolutely right, the first version is completely unplayable, and it's something I should have noticed before I even posted the card for feedback.\n\nIt might help to illustrate the process by which I got there, though. I started with the card exactly as you suggested, scrying based on the threat of the active location. The existence of 6-to-10 threat locations gave me pause, however. 0 cost to search *and reorder* 10 cards is incredible value - probably way too much. A single play of the card as envisioned can let you choose what the encounter deck flips for the rest of the game in solo. And the effect can be repeated with multiple copies of the event + Scroll of Isildur\n\nI then discarded the threat-of-the-active-location idea, but I wanted to keep the thematic association with locations that you had identified. So I settled on having it as a response to travelling to a location. But how deep should it scry? The willpower of the exhausted character was the obvious solution, but it should have been obvious that that required expensive and high-wp allies, which makes it a poor use of actions.\n\nSo, back to the drawing board, I suppose (although the resource acceleration angle isn't a bad one, and Lore could use it. That said, there are plenty of other lore cards that will likely be getting touched up in the future, and one or more of them may well end up generating resources).\n\nBut your point about not having a generalized deep-scrying card isn't a bad one either. Going back to the original idea of threat on the active location, something like this might be restricted enough to not be overpowered.\n\nAhfH6Rf.png [https://i.imgur.com/AhfH6Rf.png]\n\nI still worry about cards like these, though:\n\nGladden-Marshlands.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Journey-Along-the-Anduin-Nightmare/Gladden-Marshlands.jpg]\n\nPalace-Ruins.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Deadmen's-Dike-Nightmare/Palace-Ruins.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3773463","commentId":3773463,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1567039956,"content":"Looks like those nightmare cards would also work well with Ghan-Buri-Ghan, Raven of the Mountains, and Needful To Know.  I figure if the designers are mean enough to produce cards with obscene threat, we deserve any exploitation of that we can get!  In all seriousness, even without nightmare there's still high threat locations that will be seen.  But I don't see a particularly deep scry as broken in a way that an ally's willpower is not, at least when re-ordering is not permitted.  I can't remember a solo quest where 10 cards was sufficient to cover both reveals and shadows for the entire game, though I prefer turtle to aggro."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3776516","commentId":3776516,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1567483885,"content":"And the blog post [https://thewhitetower.wordpress.com/2019/09/02/ancient-mathoms-shadows-of-mirkwood-part-3/] and video [https://youtu.be/pIb0bYYWEbM] are up for the final 3 packs of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle!

Been a little while, hasn't it?\n\nThe project is back from hiatus for the new year! There are two orders of business for the near future - the first is to work through Khazad-dum, the Dwarrowdelf cycle, and the Hobbit boxes. And there are some cards that really need some help in these packs, so I'm excited to get to them.\n\nOn that note, we have the cards we want to touch from the Khazad-dum deluxe box ready for presentation:\n\nFirst up is Dwalin:\n\neEahwEd.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/eEahwEd.jpg]\n\nWe expanded his ability to work against all enemies; but kept an added boost against Orcs, just as a nod to the origins. I have no problem with cards that have expanded use cases against certain traits, I just don't like cards that *only* work against certain traits.\n\nodB3keI.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/odB3keI.jpg]\n\nEver onward is a tricky card to make into a worthwhile choice. We attempted to make it better by reducing the cost and applying the benefit to every player; however, this may create some problems with Doom Hangs Still and might be a little too powerful. Any suggestions for a different way we could take this would be appreciated. At the very least, we want to take this card out of the realm of \"maybe useful in a solo deck, but next to useless in multiplayer.\"\n\nWv3apbV.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/Wv3apbV.jpg]\n \nThe Veteran of Nanduhirion is just a little bit overcosted, but incredibly overshadowed by the Erebor Battle-master. We wanted to give this guy an identity of his own. We kept the stats, and the thematic enters-play-with-a-damage text, but we gave him a readying ability, which will hopefully make him an attractive choice for a high-cost, high-impact ally.\n \nBOw9Q0T.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/BOw9Q0T.jpg]\n \nAncestral Knowledge was limited to the active location, which made it tricky to use well. By letting you clear a location in the staging area with it, it becomes more general use.\n \nd8BFf2f.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/d8BFf2f.jpg]\n \nFinally, boots from erebor. They just don't do enough for the cost of a card drawn from your deck. The discard-to-ready mechanic is an interesting ability, although it overlaps a little bit with Cram. The thinking right now that the restriction to Dwarves and Hobbits makes it alright, but I'm not 100% convinced. Our standard approach to 0-cost cards was to add card draw, but I don't see that one working well here. I'm also potentially considering \"discard to add a resource to attached hero's resource pool,\" but that limits it to heroes. Any thoughts on this one would be particularly appreciated as well.\n \nThe second phase of our project in the new year is to do a review with some experience of previous cards and update any that need it based on our playtesting experience. We have a few cards here that need an extra touch - either we didn't do enough the first time, or we left a card alone that really should have been helped.\n \nThe first 2 cards are obvious:\n \nkuBBlmw.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/kuBBlmw.jpg]\n \nHorn of Gondor is a card that has gotten a lot of flack since its errata. There has been a great deal of debate in the community about whether or not it is still worth playing - and honestly, in a full modern card pool, I think it is if you're committing to a chump blocking strategy. The meta has moved away from that, but it's still a viable way to play the game. However, what clinched the decision for us was that - as we played through the early quests with the Ancient Mathoms cards, we just almost never got a lot of use out of it. It never seemed to give the impact we wanted from it, and especially from a powerful artifact like the Horn, that felt wrong.\n \nWe are not going to reverse the errata - its original form in a modern Silvan deck would just be too much. However, losing that resource acceleration significantly hurt Rohan discard and Eagles, archetypes which have either never recovered or only recovered in the last cycle (thanks to a hero Radagast). We added language that would permit discarded allies to trigger the resource generation as well, hoping to help out those archetypes as well as synergize with a few Gondor cards that get discarded from play.\n \nIn addition, we added an ability to reduce an enemy's attack and defense by 1. It feels more thematic that way, and that's enough justification for me.\n \nj7VUHAb.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/j7VUHAb.jpg]\n \nThe Blade of Gondolin is another card that is probably just about fine the way it was. The progress on the quest was really pretty valuable. The problem was that it gets outshined by any card that actually adds attack power. Again, we originally left it alone, thinking that it could pull its own weight. But then we almost never included it. We didn't want extra progress during the combat phase, we wanted help clearing out enemies. So we just removed the restriction about Orc enemies, and now it gives +1 attack all the time. This should probably put it into competition with most generic weapons - they most often *can* give +2 attack, but only under optimal circumstances. The guaranteed progress weighed against the potential of more attack is an interesting decision point, I think.\n \nEjqjtfz.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/Ejqjtfz.jpg]\n \nBrok Ironfist got a small quality-of-life fix. We changed his enter's play ability to discard the top 5 cards and then put a dwarf ally into play from the discard, instead of discarding until you found a Dwarf ally. The original ability could potentially discard your whole deck in one go, and that was an unintended consequence.\n \nFJGANyl.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/FJGANyl.jpg]\n \nGuard of the Citadel was just not getting used, even with his new ability. Well, we were including him in decks, but almost never because of his ability. And we were just waiting for better allies to replace him. So we added another small boost - making it so that he doesn't exhaust to quest. Now he is one of the best allies to include in a Leadership Boromir deck, and even in a Gondor Swarm without Boromir, his action advantage is useful. He doesn't work well with Leadership Faramir, but that's a small price to pay.\n \nLc9OtOu.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/Lc9OtOu.jpg]\n \nThe last card was Wandering Took. Again, we were only including him until we had better Spirit allies, and his ability is marginal at best. We had originally left him alone because his cost to stat ratio, plus ability seemed to be fine. But he quickly gets outshined by dedicated allies who do what they do better. We toyed with a number of different ideas, many aimed at helping out the Spirit hobbits, who needed threat reduction to use their abilities effectively. We landed on a simple enters-play response, reducing threat by 2. Better reduction than Galadriel's Handmaiden, but her 2 willpower makes her a better ally for most decks, I think. The enters play ability synergizes some with Tom Cotton, and even more with Raise the Shire.\n \nAs always, we'd love to hear any feedback you have to offer! And happy New Year to everyone!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3862903","commentId":3862903,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1578317327,"content":"I like the changes to Dwalin, Veteran of Nanduhirion, Ancestral Knowledge, Blade of Gondolin, Guard of the Citadel and Wandering Took.\n\nDwalin was just too specialized against Orcs and now he is actually useful against almost every quest. I cannot say, whether he really needs a limit, given that he has none so far and I find other dwarves to be more worthy of readying like Gimli, both Thorins or Dain.\n\nThe Veteran of Nanduhirion would be a fine card, if it was not for Dain's buff, but giving him some readying is a good idea in order to use his attack more. And the Boots of Erebor help him to attack more often. He probably should have a limit to his action, as unlimited attacks per round with enough healing can get out of hand fast. Similar allies like the Knight of Dale already have a limit.\n\nOpening up Ancestral Knowledge for any location is a good move to counter location lock. Maybe the four progress should be also restricted to dwarves for thematic reasons, but that is not super important for me.\n\nGiven that Boots are used for travelling, the Boots of Erebor could help with this aspect of the game. I would also like something similar to Arod or Warden of Arnor, but the boots are not unique and less restrictive then the title.\n\nWhile I love the new combat action on Horn of Gondor (so thematic), I am not yet sure, whether I like it triggering of discarding allies. Eagles or fine in my opinion and Rohan has Théoden, Gúthwinë and Gamling to make allies cheaper and even recur them. Imagine the combination of Théoden, Grimbold and Gamling: 2 Willpower and a Feint every round for only 1 tactics ressource, that is insane. At least the horn must be exhausted to do so, thus it will not be overpowered.\n\nDropping the Orc requirement on Blade of Gondolin is a good idea, as it will widen its usability for many quests.\n\nBrok Ironfist, sigh. Even with a second dwarf from the discard pile he is really expensive. Kili and Fili together have about the same stats as Brok for half the cost with more flexibility and buff potential from Dain. His ability does not synergize with many other dwarves like Erebor Toymaker, Dwalin, Bifur, Glóin, Fili, Kili, Bofur and Erebor Hammersmith.

(I love the way you break up the commentary with the bolded names, btw, it's an excellent means to keep track of where your focus is in a long response.)\n\nThe Boots of Erebor certainly could help with travel - I'm a little concerned about encroaching on Thror's Map territory in terms of ignoring travel effects. On the other hand, how would something like this feel:\n\nZNMLt1M.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/ZNMLt1M.jpg]\n\nThat is more restrictive, but might be worth it in combination with the HP boost.\n\nFor the Horn of Gondor, that's a valid point - I still think that the Rohan discard is not where it needs to be, personally, but the Horn of Gondor change was even more about giving it back some of the utility it had lost without breaking the game again. In some sense, just making it work again in some of the old decks that got invalidated by the errata. If it turns out to be too powerful, I wouldn't have a problem dropping the discard text again.\n\nBrok Ironfist - the hope is that Dwarves will have enough resource generating ability to be able to afford him; he explicitly slots in a mining deck right now, and those can really generate resources. 6 leadership to get Brok alone isn't worth it, but Brok + Gimli? That's 2 resources for Brok's stats, plus pulling an ally that you mined away back onto the table. Or perhaps the best-case scenario: Brok + Soldier of Erebor.\n\nMy thought is that Brok is probably worth playing just for his stats at about 4 cost. Maybe still a tad overcosted there, but probably worth 4 with Dain's buff for sure, and maybe even without it. Which means that pulling an ally of 3 cost or more is a good trade (not to mention that you're getting an ally from the discard pile that you might not otherwise get), if you can handle 6 resources up front. Which I'll admit is the core issue. But I think a dwarf mining deck can handle it.\n\nBut I guess that's something that playtesting will figure out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3863808","commentId":3863808,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1578413599,"content":"> 19 hours ago, Onidsen said:\n> \n> Thanks for the comments!

take:\n\nI like the change to Dwalin.  Making him useful in non-Orc scenarios goes a long way is all he needs to be a useful hero.  Between his two attack, no ranged, and the limited supply of enemies to kill, I don't think a limit needs to be placed on his ability.\n\nEver Onward seems well balanced for a card you play when you unexpectedly quest unsuccessfully -- but why would you play it that way?  If it covers all players, the way to use it would be to send no one questing (OK, maybe Spirit Bofur for one resource) and devote everybody to combat.  It's true that Ever Onward in its current form is only useful for solo decks, but it's actually quite a powerful card in that format if you essentially skip questing.  I see two options to change how it works to be applicable to multiplayer:\n\n1) If you're going to let every deck ignore questing, you need to pay for it.  Increase the cost with the number of players.\n\n2) If you want to turn this card into a cover-for-unsuccessful questing, akin to Free to Choose, don't grant a blanket threat increase exemption, make it a cheap response conditional on actually questing -- e.g. reduce the threat taken according to the number of questing characters, so that the no-quester option is foreclosed.\n\nAncestral Knowledge is vastly more useful when it can be used on staging -- I would restrict the 4-point underground/mountain effect to dwarves, though, for thematic reasons.\n\nBoots from Erebor with readying does crimp on Cram, both from having a second beneficial effect and from being useful on characters.  Since it's restricted to dwarves/hobbits that's OK mechanically, but thematically Cram itself is strongly associated with dwarves (including the card artwork), so making Cram obselete for dwarves is a thematic miss.  Placing progress on the active location is a nice bonus and ties into \"boots\", but placing on the active location is also the least useful to place.  Discarding for travel effect makes it Thror's Map after the stealth errata.  (Though if you used the word \"travel\" like Strider's Path does, it at least would synergize with the Burglar contract, which would be thematically appropriate....)\n\nThe thing about the boots is that aside from Gimli/Gloin (and your reworked Veteran of Nand) there's not a particularly good reason to put it on dwarves.  Hobbits are more fragile, but there it's the heroes that are buffed, and Bill is a more efficient way to boost everybody.  For any \"character\" attachment I want to see a reason I'd want to put it on an ally, but dwarves and hobbits have so little in common it's tough to think of a thematic or mechanical boost that would be attractive to both groups.  Maybe a mining hook?\n\nFor Horn of Gondor, I love the exhaust to scare an enemy -- much more thematic than resource generation.  For resource generation I absolutely think adding discard is justified, and since it exhausts it wouldn't be overpowered even if it were still just \"leaves play\".  Making you choose betwen generation and enemy-scaring makes the card more interesting and flexible.\n\nBrok Ironfist's enter play makes him effectively cheaper in a dwarf deck and works with mining (although too few cards actually like to be mined).  Neither of those are viable in the core, so poor Brok really needs something that would make him generically useful.  4 cost might do that, though his ability is still pretty useless.  Six is a lot of resources to collect, so how about this:\n\nResponse: When Brok Ironfist is played from your hand, you play may another ally from your hand at no cost.\n\nNow saving up for Brok is worth it, and you're not gambling that something good is in the next five cards.  Since it's played from your hand it can't be abused by Sneak Attack, and it gives you two free allies instead of one if you lose a dwarf hero.\n\nI like the changes to Guard of the Citadel and Wandering Took.\n\n \n\nEdited January 7 by

The biggest worry I have is making it not overlap with the non-Valour action for Doom Hangs Still. On the other hand, I think that most of the valour events will need some love from this project - although we'll have to wait until the end of the current cycle to see what comes out. After all, almost nobody includes Doom Hangs Still for its non-valour effect except in The Black Gate Opens.\n\nOn yet another hand, though, I think that you are the only person I've ever seen making the assertion that Ever Onward is actually a good card in solo. I can see the utility, but seldom find myself in situations where it could actually help. Maybe that's just my playing style (which shapes so much of this project, even as I try to stretch my limits and open up a wide variety of new opportunities, I'm still limited by my own preferred plays, etc - another reason why I find feedback so helpful), though. Anyways, to make a long story short, I'm still a little stuck on it.\n\nOn Ancestral Knowledge, you make an excellent point. I'm half-considering dropping the added option of exhausting a Lore character, making the card back into a dwarf-only form of location control.\n\nBoots from Erebor - this has been a tricky one. Your idea of a mining trigger is a good one - the Facebook group suggested having it draw you cards after it is discarded off of the top of your deck. I'm...less than enthused about that particular idea - I'd prefer to have events be the mining trigger. That said, something like this might be interesting:\n\nzesYvtv.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/zesYvtv.jpg]\n\nI particularly like getting the boots into play if you mine them - it's something I'd want to preserve if we end up going with a mining theme for them.\n\nRe: Horn of Gondor, I'm really glad you like it - it's probably the one we spent the most time on trying to get right. I think that you're right that it wouldn't be overpowered with allies leaving play, but I wanted to place some limits on it. Honestly, though, it might be worth it just to save the word space on the card. I'm still wishing that there was enough space for it to lose the restricted keyword if the attached hero is Boromir. But I just tested it in Strange Eons, and I don't save enough space to actually get to fit that tagline. Sometimes we just can't have everything we want.\n\nYeah - we've noticed that Brok isn't really working very well in the Core Set only environment - although there are enough Dwarf allies to make it possible, I think (including the Longbeard Orc-Slayer in-sphere and the Erebor Hammersmith and Miner of the Iron Hills out-of-sphere), and Eowyn makes it possible to get them into the discard pile (and we haven't actually tried making this version of him work - the previous version did not quite work the same way).\n\nI kind of don't want to reduce his cost - that's the obvious thing to do. But also, I've been really influenced by an article by Master of Lore [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2015/04/03/brok-ironfist/] on the theme of Brok Ironfist. Having realized how well it works (intentionally or otherwise), I want to preserve that if possible. To boost his utility in a Core Set environment, could something like this work?\n\nAy02AW8.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/Ay02AW8.jpg]\n\nStill only works with Dwarf allies, but you don't have to go through the trouble of getting one into the discard pile. Maybe still more trouble than he's worth in a Core-only environment for only 3 different Dwarf allies (which would make 9 cards in the deck he could work with), but there were a lot of cards that were that way, and they still got played by virtue of having no other options, as the resources from Steward just piled up with nothing to play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3864391","commentId":3864391,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1578451480,"content":"I admit that I ignored Ever Onward when I first encountered it, thinking of it as an expensive emergency get-out-of-jail response instead of what I think it truly is -- a planning action that's deferred until after quest resolution.  While Doom Hangs Still may not be popular as a non-valour option, the fact that it's priced at 5 at least tells you how powerful the designers *think* the card is, and I don't think they're wrong.  There's *lots* of quests where I find myself in a situation where I either don't want to place progress or just don't need to place progress anymore, yet I have to spend significant amount of my characters questing to keep from taking on threat.  This can be a game-winning card in a lot of boss fights, though that's only true in decks where the heroes/allies are versatile enough to be used as either questers or combatants.  This varies by trait and sphere, for example it's obviously more useful for Gondor decks than Rohan.\n\nReducing the cost from 3 to 2 makes a bigger difference in affordability than a 2/1 reduction IMO, 3 is the magic number that takes it out of splash territory.  And extending Ever Onward to other players makes it the equivalent of non-valour Doom Stands Still -- and I *guarantee* that'd be a popular card at 2 even without a Valour option!\n\nBut since Doom Stands Still does exist, rethinking Ever Onward as the card I think people first perceive it as (the get-out-of-jail-free emergency card) would at least give it a unique function not found elsewhere.  But that requires altering cost *and* function dramatically, which really isn't in the spirit of what you're trying to do, I think.\n\nOn Boots of Erebor I also like the idea of putting into play when discarded, plus a benefit -- I don't think there's enough of those cards for mining/milling decks.  I was thinking about a resource rather than a card because of the riches of Erebor, though that makes it an inferior Hidden Cache for mining.  What I'd *really* like thematically is a way to synergize with pipes, but since the Hobbit Pipe is tied only to events, even a modest threat reduction wouldn't trigger it.  And of course any explicit reference to pipes in KD would be useless for a long time.\n\nOn Brok Ironfist I'm not enthused about tying it to other dwarves specifically.  I liked the article too, and if he had arrived in OHUH or OtDS or even KD/Dwarrowdelf I'd be fine to relegating his value to dwarf decks.  But in the core I think there are too few dwarves to count on one being around to be with him.  I think he should be general purpose, especially with 6 cost -- 6 cost needs to be *cool*.  Beorn is, while Brok is the opposite of cool.  But if Brok could bring Beorn along with him (best case) -- that'd be dramatically cool.  Brok represents a massive investment, he needs to be a game changer and he can't do that with his own stats alone.  Perhaps getting an ally from the discard instead of from hand would be better, that'd open up synergies with dwarven mining in the future and fits the rescue theme better.\n\nAnother possibility is to exploit the situation where Brok Ironfist actually gets played in current core-only decks, including Brok because of lack of alternatives and playing him only when you have massive Steward of Gondor fueled resources piling up.  Allow Brok to be readied for a resource and put no limit on it.  Since he only has 1 defense that's not going to be game breaking, but as the card pool expands Brok's value will increase with ally attachments.  Or allow resources to be spent to increase one of his statistics until the end of phase, or some other useful sink -- if you've got the resources to waste on Brok Ironfist, why not let him continue to drain your resources for something useful?\n\nI think you're right to stick to 6 cost.  Reduce Brok to a fair price and he might get played, but he's still boring with a rarely used ability and will be squeezed out by cheaper, more interesting dwarves despite his good stats.  Make him spectacular.\n\nFor Horn of Gondor, if you can't lose the restricted for Boromir, why not remove the restricted entirely?  In practice Restricted means that this attachment will be relegated to a questing hero, and that's actively anti-thematic."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3864781","commentId":3864781,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1578497645,"content":"> 20 hours ago, Onidsen said:\n> \n> For 0 cost, I'd probably want the boots to not stack with each other.

I always forget about the Veteran Axehand.\n\nI'm onboard with removing the restricted keyword altogether. That card image looks like a *lot* of text, which is something I worry about. The line about Boromir pushes the text another font size smaller - removing it gives a much more manageable reading load. Removing the restricted keyword feels like a better solution altogether.\n\nHonestly, the more I'm thinking about it, the more I want to help mining in other places (The End Comes, anybody?), and the more I am wanting to give Boots of Erebor an ability like this:\n\nuB2GmyG.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/uB2GmyG.jpg]\n\nIt's thematic (boots in a travel action, that's beautiful), and it's useful.\n\nWhich is, of course, exactly what the errata did to Thror's Map, except for 0-cost, which is an appropriate cost for the ability.\n\nThat, of course, leaves us with Thror's Map. We had been going to nerf it (less drastically, but make it so it didn't completely invalidate every travel effect in the game forever with no downside or cost).

Allowing it to discard an non-unique active location after travelling is a nice idea, but still restricted to the short people. How about attaching them to anyone and give the hitpoint boost only to dwarves and hobbits, the other races are too big to wear the boots comfortably?\n\nI also like Dale's idea of exhausting attached hero and Thr´ór's Map instead of discarding it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3868581","commentId":3868581,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1578766160,"content":"Allowing character attachment and a bonus for dwarves only would make it another great card for Dale decks.  I don't think it would be overpowered at +1 hp for all, +2 for dwarf/hobbits, since it's limit 1 per character and hp is the least useful stat."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3890053","commentId":3890053,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1581323479,"content":"Thank you again for all the feedback.\n\nHere are the current versions of the Brok Ironfist, Boots from Erebor and Ever Onward. I think I've got them much closer to right, now. Thanks @dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/] for the ideas, especially with Brok. I was skeptical, but it doesn't feel too thematically weird to have him bringing in non-Dwarves, and it makes him a powerful choice, even in a Core Set environment.\n\nCKwG9N8.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/CKwG9N8.jpg]\n\nzesYvtv.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/zesYvtv.jpg]\n\nCkHD0Eg.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/CkHD0Eg.jpg]\n\nAnd now, for something new: Cards from Redhorn Gate and Road to Rivendell!\n\nDunedain Wanderer was a lackluster card to begin with, even in a secrecy deck. For 2 cost, you got some decent stats, but nothing flashy. We've changed that. The extra hit point makes the sentinel keyword go further. However, the big draw is now that he is an option to break the stranglehold that Lore has on healing. It's not a very cost-effective healing effect, and if you have lore, you still go with the lore options. But it opens up healing for decks that don't have lore, and feels appropriately thematic.\n\neyoPPlG.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/eyoPPlG.jpg]\n\nThis was another really difficult card to use well. It seems to be designed for 2-hero decks, but even there it was hit or miss and you seldom actually played it. Not to mention that 2-hero decks just weren't worth playing with the Dwarrowdelf card pool. We've tightened up the explicit interaction with 2-hero decks, and made the card reliable. Now its a deck accelerant, helping you find and pay for the cards you need to overcome the disadvantage of less than 3 heroes.\n\nmrr7I5E.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/mrr7I5E.jpg]\n\nTimely Aid is an exceptionally powerful card in a secrecy deck, and totally useless outside of one. That was a common theme among the dwarrowdelf secrecy cards, and it was a problem even for the secrecy decks, because an unwelcome threat raise could effectively turn off all the cards in your hand. We just dropped the cost (and the secrecy value) by 1 so that you could still play it after you are out of secrecy. And it might even be worth running in a non-secrecy deck - 3 cost to get an ally isn't bad, especially when you can look in the top 5 of your deck for it. Even if you don't find a 4 or 5 cost ally, you are still probably running ahead just by being able to fish it out of your deck.\n\ng6MIi2U.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/g6MIi2U.jpg]\n\nKeeping Count is an intriguing card, but it is limited by the fact that you have to find your second copy for it to even do anything at all. We've made it so that playing 1 copy fishes out the second copy from your deck, which makes it much easier to play, while increasing the cost by 1 to compensate. The wording was also tightened up to make room for the extra response, but I *think* that we have managed to keep the same effect, just described in much fewer words. The attack boost was also limited to +5, mostly out of consideration for Thalin, who now quests with his attack, not his willpower.\n\nBKlb723.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/BKlb723.jpg]\n\nFor the Rider of the Mark, we cleaned up his wording a little bit, but also made it so that any player could trigger the action to move him around. This eliminates the need to have Spirit on both sides of the table. In addition, we moved his point of defense into his attack to make it a little more useful to move him around - if you haven't quested with him, he can provide a decent boost to your partner's attack.\n\nGvxckux.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/Gvxckux.jpg]\n\nRenewed Friendship is *almost* good as it is. We have increased the magnitude of the effects - playtesting will see if that was enough.\n\nbJR1CyX.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/bJR1CyX.jpg]\n\nThe Ravenhill Scout is laughably bad (I mean, I want to like him. I want to so bad. But he's just not good at all). So we made him a quester (which was thematically appropriate), and made his ability into a response that triggers when he commits to the quest. He might even be a little too good now.\n\nmCQ1Udp.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/mCQ1Udp.jpg]\n\nBombur was, if anything, even worse than the Ravenhill Scout, unless the quest had high-threat underground locations. We have boosted his stats - he is now a credible defender, and can be given Burning Brand to make him even better. But he can also reduce the threat of a location in staging by 2, which is the equivalent of 2 willpower. That's not bad, and he can do it after staging, which is even more valuable.\n\n3O2n3S6.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/3O2n3S6.jpg]\n\nNeedful to Know was tricky. We removed the threat cost to look at the top card, but it still feels a little lackluster. Any thoughts or feedback here would be appreciated.\n\nyDEvKk7.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/yDEvKk7.jpg]\n\nFinally, The End Comes. Probably the worst card in the game. Full stop. There was no way to redeem this card while sticking close to its original design. So, we decided to go for broke and attempt to make it spectacular. We tied it thematically to mining, and gave it a really powerful effect - a resource to every hero in play, and 2 cards to every player. But then, just like the dwarves of old delved too greedily and too deep, and disturbed things the wished they hadn't, so can your mining deck. Each player ends up with an enemy as the result of their recklessness. Thematic, powerful, but with a rather large drawback to go along with it.\n\nEbanJDQ.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/EbanJDQ.jpg]\n\nAs always, let us know what you think!

takes:\n\nBrok Ironfist's final form I like, as you might expect.  I notice the \"hand or discard pile\" has been reduced to discard pile, but I think that's OK.  Brok's still worth six and still cool.\n\nBoots of Erebor I'm still not entirely happy with.  I think we need more cards being mined, but the effect is still weak and the connection with location that appeals to us all isn't there.  I still would like it to be +1 hp for character and +2 hp for Hobbit/Dwarves, I don't think it's that overpowered and it makes it at least usable outside dwarf/hobbit decks.  (OK, there's a size-of-foot issue, but though dwarves are short I'm not sure their feet are small.)\n\nHow about this -- when discarded from the deck it gets put into play and puts two progress on a location?  The future travel-related space doesn't leave a lot of room for travel effects, espcially random one, but progress can always be useful.\n\nI like Ever Onward scaling, but I think the cost should be 1 plus the number of players.  2 is not too much for solo, and the difficulty of assembling resources justifies the mild ramp from there.\n\nLooking at the new cards now with Dunedain Wanderer, reducing the secrecy/regular differential is a fine idea, and the point that inflated non-secrecy is most painful to secrecy decks is a good one.  I love the passive healing as an enhancement, that makes him interesting and useful for a Dunedain deck at full price.\n\nTaking Initiative with your changes is a fine card in a two-hero deck, which needs help.  The one objection from a progression standpoint is that even with this card, two-hero decks still aren't likely to be useful until Strider comes out.  (IIRC, you still \"control\" the captured hero in Dol Goldur.)   But at least the changes make it useful when Strider does come, instead of having to wait for Grey Wanderer.\n\nTimely Aid benefits from the reduced differential, I like it.\n\nFor Keeping Count, I think Amicus is right, however it is put into play it should fetch the other copy -- and it shouldn't fail if the other copy isn't currently in the deck instead of hand or discard.  Your limit of two in play will stop the effect from repeating.\n\nFor Riders of the Mark I also agree with Amicus, just require a resource instead of a spirit resource to transfer control.\n\nI like Renewed Friendship, it's Gandalf-lite minus the direct damage -- but that's frequently the best part of Gandalf.  The short-edge of the benefit is really the \"ready a hero\" part, since the opportunity for this card is in the planning phase, it's rare that a hero *isn't* ready.  How about something actually useful to a hero?  Removing damage or adding resources (it's still their planning phase) would be more compelling.  Maybe the third option should be returning the resources spent on the attachment played cross-table?\n\nI like the changes to Ravenhill Scout, now he is actually worthy of being in a Dale deck with Rhovanion Outriders.  I don't think the effect is too powerful, since it can only redistribute what's already there and it can't be triggered after staging.  But now it's at least useful.\n\nBombur is not as useful, since his effective 2-wp is reliant on the presence of a location, unlike the Scout's flat two.  Being able to do it after staging is a plus, but even with the much needed stat buf he's not that handy in combat -- 2/3 defenders won't last long even with ABB.  I think one more thematic enhancement might help Bombur, though its usefulness will have to weight for the Hobbit cards -- make ally Bombur worth two dwarf characters, like the hero version does.\n\nNeedful to Know is worth 0, with a scry and possible threat reduction.  But at full price it's not at all compelling even with the threat raise removed.  Maybe this should be 1-cost with Secrecy 1?  Threat reduction is more useful to a secrecy deck at 21 threat than at 20.\n\nAnd then there's The End Comes.  I like the idea of a powerful, dangerous mining effect, very thematic.  And removing the dwarf-leaves-play mechanic makes the card accessible to the handful of quests where you actually want the original effect.  But that's still the problem with the card -- so few quests benefit from the action that it's still a useless card in hand most of the time, even if it's got a great mining effect.  Even Hidden Cache in hand would be better.\n\nWith limited space and the necessity for it to keep doing the very-rarely-done-thing that only it can do, how to enhance it?  My thought is for it to say \"Shuffle all but one encounter card back into the deck\" -- that's not quite as good as putting a nasty card in the victory display, but it at least means you can make sure *something* doesn't show up for a long time.  A more powerful alternative would be \"Shuffle any number of cards from the encounter discard back into the deck\", though in that case you would also want to add the card to the victory display to prevent it from being recurred."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3890497","commentId":3890497,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1581361997,"content":"By

In the Facebook group, everyone is absolutely certain that the new Dunedain Wanderer is overpowered, and there are questions like \"why did you even give him an ability at all, why not just reduce the cost?\" To which my answer is, of course: even at reduced cost, he's not fun to play. There's no interesting choices there.\n\nBut here, you are all quite appreciative of the ability, and don't see it as OP. It's a fascinating contrast.\n\nThe Facebook group did suggest a change that I liked - tying the healing ability to being engaged with an enemy (and perhaps a limit once per round on the healing, to avoid ally-readying shenanigans like Spare Hood and Cloak + Boromir). \"While you are engaged with an enemy, Dunedain Wanderer gains...\" Secrecy decks seldom like to remain engaged with an enemy over multiple turns, but he's still useful there just as a body with good stats. I'd like to get the thoughts of the group here.\n\nMUClATX.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/MUClATX.jpg]\n\nI really like the proposed modifications to The End Comes and Boots from Erebor. I think that puts them to their final version. Unfortunately, we already recorded the video for them, so I guess they'll get an Ancient Mathoms errata :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nKeeping Count has been altered to have the original wording back, just with the card search response added in. Apparently, the new wording caused many rules problems, and it turned out that I hadn't saved as much space as I had thought. The card search was the important bit, and your point about making it an enters play ability is well taken. Here's the updated version:\n\nb5EQ9fx.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/b5EQ9fx.jpg]\n\nAgreed on the ultimate usefulness of Taking Initiative being delayed until Strider comes out (and going through the roof with the Grey Wanderer), but since the designers seemed to be trying to encourage 2-hero decks unsuccessfully in this cycle, I thought moving a little in that direction might not be a bad thing for the cycle. At least it gives those early experimental secrecy decks another tool.\n\nFor Renewed Friendship, I like the idea of adding resources generally; however, the readying provides some really interesting deckbuilding opportunities. There are a few heroes who can exhaust for effects in the planning phase (Lore Denethor, Beravor, Galadriel - 2 of them from the core set), and the new Guarded cards (and especially the Burglar's Turn contract) mean that you can play this card in the quest phase after you clear a location, or during combat after you kill an enemy. Both are tricky enough options that I'd be sad to see them go.\n\nThat would be an interesting addition to Bombur. Of course, it would mean that we'd have to add something new to the hero. But I suspect that there will be little surprise that we were already planning on doing that :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nThe cost reduction on Needful to Know is an excellent idea. I don't think that extra card draw is necessary for it, although we will keep it in mind as a buff if it is still too weak.\n\nThe Rider of the Mark suggestion is interesting. The spirit resource was kept off of the original card, of course, but we expanded it to let any player trigger the action to add a little bit of symmetry (and maybe some foreshadowing) of the similar kinds of cards released in the Dreamchaser cycle, specifically Ceorl. It also parallels our update to the Horseback Archer, from the Core Set:\n\nhNnlmy3.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/hNnlmy3.jpg]\n\nWe are/were trying to develop a sort of sub-theme about Rohan allies that jump around the table to do things.\n\nFinally, the End Comes. Unfortunately, I don't think I have room on the card to have it shuffle the discard pile back into the encounter deck. I suppose that with judicious scrying and carefully waiting until the encounter deck runs out, you could get the benefit without the drawback, and I'm not sure how I feel about it.\n\nIt is also not especially useful in hand. I'm thinking of giving hero Bombur an ability that can help deal with that - something like \"Action: Draw a card, then shuffle 1 card from your hand into your deck. Limit once per round.\" Having an effect like that in the card pool would mitigate the extremely niche use case of the in-hand ability.\n\nAnyways, again, I appreciate the feedback!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3892131","commentId":3892131,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1581507366,"content":"There's no question that passive healing is a very powerful ability -- I love Wellinghall Preserver for just that reason, and it is limited to healing Ents.  Healing *anybody* is even better and limiting it to once per round, when engaged with an enemy, is a fine idea that both ties in with the Dunedain theme and limits the application somewhat.\n\nBut certainly cost reduction to 4 isn't enough, because 4 is too much for a 1/2/2/3 vanilla ally even if it has ranged and sentinel.  1 leadership, 2 attack is low for 4-cost and without warrior trait isn't easily buffed.  And 2/3 doesn't allow many defenses.  He has to have *some* cool ability to make him worthwhile.  Dunedain healing is thematic, and also desparately needed in an archtype that is powered by engaged enemies.  Besides, look at the art -- he's clearly operating on that poor sick deer.\n\nFor the End Comes, I think the current ability is insufficient, as it's too narrow.  It needs to be at least marginally useful in hand for a generic quest, or even in a mining deck it's a tough sell.  But with space a problem on the card, adding additional text to shuffling the encounter back in means cutting text out of the very thematic discard effect.\n\nAnd thinking about it further, although I really like the idea of a powerful, dangerous, unpredictable mining effect, I'm not sure I'd want such an effect in a mining deck *in practice*.  I think the reward can be worth the enemy, I've used Dunedain Hunter a lot and 3 resources and 2 cards is generally better than a free Hunter.  But with the Hunter I only play him when I think I can handle it.  If I'm a mining deck and I absolutely cannot afford another enemy, I may be forced to stop mining.  As cool and thematic as random dangerous mining effects are, I think it might hamper the card in practice, especially with a near-worthless main ability.\n\nHow about instead of getting the player in trouble, it helps a player in trouble, and tie back loosely to the \"dead dwarf\" theme.  Something like \"Response: when discarded from top of deck, draw one card per engaged enemy and a hero gains one resource per ally in the discard pile (max 3 resources).\"  Now if you've got enemies or dead (well, more likely mined) allies the card helps you out, but does nothing when mined if there is clear sailing.\n\nGoing back to the main effect, how about giving a choice between shuffling the encounter discard back into the discard *or* shuffling a single card from your discard back into your deck.  That would be both generically useful and welcome for mining decks in particular.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3892142","commentId":3892142,"userName":"naverag","timestamp":1581509203,"content":"The

we're back! It's only been 3 months plus or minus a quarantine in between! Buckle up everyone, because we have a wild ride ahead. Ancient Mathoms cards from Watcher in the Water and The Long Dark!\n\nStarting off is the hero errata we all love to hate: Hama\n\nThis design is from @dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/] - and I think it's brilliant. Adding the event to the victory display allows us to keep the mechanic of Hama attacking to get the event back (along with discarding a card), and also opens up some interesting space for the victory display deck. It's also a nice, clean way to prevent infinite recursion of events without the clumsy 3-times-per-game restriction.\n\nCVkNJOP.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/CVkNJOP.jpg]\n\nThe Watcher of the Bruinen is an interesting card - not exhausting to defend can be a powerful ability, but that downside is hard to swallow. And only having 2 defense and 2 hit points makes it even worse - it takes way too much investment to make him good. We've tried to improve that by increasing the defense to 3. Now the ally can actually defend against more than just the weakest enemies, and with a little investment, can be extremely useful.\n\nsvyShct.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/svyShct.jpg]\n\nAlly Erestor is a powerful effect to have in play, but at 4 cost, he's often extremely hard to justify (not to mention that he competes with his hero version). We have 2 different proposed fixes - one reduces the cost to 3, bringing his cost and effect more in line with later unique allies. The other boosts his willpower and defense by 1, bringing his stats in line with what we'd expect from a unique 4-cost ally. I originally preferred the 4-cost version, but the new Messenger of the King contract kind of threw things for a loop. Changing his stats increases his threat cost with Messenger of the king, so we decided to see if the community preferred the version with only 3 cost instead.\n\nA9bJXvb.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/A9bJXvb.jpg]\n\nVJNa5d0.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/VJNa5d0.jpg]\n\nThe next 2 events are pretty niche - we just reduced the cost to 0 from 1. Fresh Tracks is a useful effect, but it's hard to compete with other events. Grave Cairn might still be too niche - I don't know. I've been tempted to make it able to be used for any stat - willpower, defense, or attack, to give it a little more versatility.\n\nd4p23Om.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/d4p23Om.jpg]\n\nUSf7Czx.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/USf7Czx.jpg]\n\nSword that was Broken is not particularly a broken card. It's extremely powerful in an Aragorn deck, and totally useless outside. That's not a bad thing, per se - it is appropriately thematic, for one thing. But the 3 cost \"add a leadership resource icon\" bothers me. It's completely backwards from the way the rest of the Aragorn attachments work, so we turned things around a bit. Now it has an effect regardless of who you play it on, but the effect becomes extra-powerful with Aragorn, in addition to the extra resource icon.\n\nk5jErpc.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/k5jErpc.jpg]\n\nEver My Heart Rises is another card that - just like Dwalin - is powerful in some quests and useless in others. And I'm continuing my vendetta against those types of cards. Now the attached Dwarf character readies whenever you travel to a location. In keeping with the original effect, you still get the threat reduction if the location is Underground or Mountain, but the core focus of the card isn't locked behind that quest choice anymore. Because the effect became more powerful, we raised the cost by 1 as well.\n\nwJqtWbs.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/wJqtWbs.jpg]\n\nOut of Sight got our standard secrecy treatment - reducing the non-secrecy cost while leaving the in-secrecy cost the same.\n\n9xcsIdJ.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/9xcsIdJ.jpg]\n\nLove of Tales is a card that feels like it needs a boost, but I'm not sure how best to do it. We are toying around with the idea of adding card draw in addition to the resource gain, but the larger issue is that it's really hard to build a dedicated Song deck, and few enough decks have enough casual songs in them to make this worth a slot or two. So, suggestions are appreciated.\n\ndJcECK9.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/dJcECK9.jpg]\n\nShort Cut got its cost reduced to 0 and expanded its use - now both hobbits and rangers can be exhausted to trigger it. But it's still not a great card. The biggest problem is that most of the time, you want locations coming off of the encounter deck - they are generally the least offensive things that can be thrown at you. So shuffling a location back into the deck to potentially get back out a game-ending treachery or difficult enemy seems...dubious. I'm most interested in suggestions here - what can be done to boost the utility of this card? If possible, I'd like to preserve the symmetry with Quick Ears as well.\n\nObdRnJ4.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/ObdRnJ4.jpg]\n\nWarden of Healing is a card that we debated giving a significant errata to - perhaps changing its cost or swapping its effect with something like the Daughter of the Nimrodel. But we finally ended up figuring out ways to boost the other healing cards to compete well with it instead of needing to nerf it. However, it still gets its self-readying ability limited to once per round. As a side effect of that change, we had to break the healing and readying into 2 separate actions, so you can now spend the resources to ready it even if you didn't exhaust it to heal in the first place. Unintentional, but putting a \"limit once per round\" on the existing ability also limits the healing to once per round, making the readying pretty pointless, and this seemed the simplest way around the problem.\n\nn2AKbc4.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/n2AKbc4.jpg]\n\nResourceful is again the target of our standard secrecy approach. At 4 resources, it's almost impossible to get good use of outside of secrecy (edge cases like cheating it into play with well-equipped, ring of Thror, or bartering aside). At 3, it's a little more palatable, although it might still not be cheap enough to see broad use outside of secrecy. I'm just not sure if I'm comfortable reducing its cost lower than that\n\nswzCeX1.jpg

takes.\n\nHama -- there's actually one subtle difference between my proposed errata and your version, in that I gave Hama the ability to play an *event* from the victory display and not just a tactics event.  This would make his interaction with victory display more interesting -- but it also takes him further afield from his original design.  The ability to recur (once) each copy of Keen as Lances and Out of the Wild would be a powerful aid to VD decks, and I think VD is a bit understrength.  However, you're making a lot of other cards VD-friendly in this project, and confining Hama to tactics events makes the text change true errata rather than feature creep.\n\nA defense boost for Watcher is certainly welcome, but at 3/2 he's still a bit fragile for multiple defenses, and in the absence of defending more than once he is pretty much all downside.  I think I'd be happier with him as a 3-cost 3/4 or 4/3 defender, especially if his attack could be bumped to 2 so he is more useful when defending only once.  Alternately, give him a willpower, so his ability not to exhaust to defend is useful on the *first* defense.  One other possibility is to stop keeping him as a high maintenance defender  and convert his downside into an upside -- instead of having to discard a card to keep him around, give him a response to discard a card in order to ready.\n\nFor Erestor/MotK I'd generally rather pay 8 threat for a 3-willpower, 2/3 defender than 6 threat for a 2-willpower 1/3 defender.  YMMV.\n\nReducing Fresh Tracks to 0 cost makes it a nifty little event.  Grave Cairn is more attractive at zero, but still has the problem that the attack boost (barring Sneak Gandalf shenanigans) is likely to be minimal on characters who leave play before your turn to attack arrives (with the corner exceptions of multiple attack targets and Vassals or Riddermark Knights).  The \"normal\" pre-attack leaving of a chump blocker generally contributes 0-1 attack, and even at zero cost that's not appealing.  I think adding *both* attack and defense wouldn't be overpowered, but as you typically only use one of those, and the values are low, still is a bad fit for the chumping that fits bit thematically with the card.\n\nOne possibility would be restricting it to an ally leaving play, and then adding the *cost* of the ally to either attack or defense.  This would allow a 2-cost chump to make a meaningful contribution, and give higher rewards for heftier allies.  But would that be too powerful for a mere leaves play, and not discarded/destroyed?\n\nI like switching the effect on STWB.  I prefer specific-hero attachments to be useful overall and most useful on the thematic match, but this attachment might as well be Aragorn exclusive, besides not matching the other Aragorn sphere granters.  +1 wp to each hero may be too weak for its 3-cost absent Aragorn, but giving the full power to non-Aragorn would make the card a staple.\n\nI like the Ever My Heart Rises/Out of Sight/Resourceful changes.\n\nLove of Tales is tough if you want to make it worth considering outside a Songs deck, although I think Drinking Song and Song of Healing will substantially increase the number of song-wielding decks.  Any reward that makes it worth considering with limited songs will make it extremely powerful in a Songs deck (though maybe that's the point?).  One way to approach it would be to have it play a card when attached, that at least makes it a cantrip in any deck that can attach it, and justify its existence in a low-song deck.  But as it's limit one and only goes on lore heroes, outside monosphere lore you would never add 3x of these to your deck as a thinner.\n\nShort Cut is indeed a problem, since trading a location for a random reveal is typically a very bad trade, and throwing a character exhaustion and a card into the bargain is even worse.  I think the best way to improve the situation is to *weaken the random reveal*.  That's the point of a short cut, after all, to get out of doing something.  Instead of shuffling and *revealing* the top encounter card, why not shuffle and *add* the top encounter card.  If it happens to be a nasty treachery, your gamble worked, and if you get a location or enemy, maybe it's better than what you had, and you might still avoid a \"When Revealed\" or Surge.  Since the shuffle immediately precedes the card and the encounter deck will have at least one location in it, I don't think it can be gamed.\n\nWarden of Healing is a sensible nerf if you're trying to break Gloin taking all undefended

Depending on the number of enemies that we can get into staging, locations, especially added locations are truly detrimental.\n\nThat all to say I like your change of \"adding\", one because you can essentially re-guard the card attached to the location without actually guarding it (the attachment becomes freed once short cut is played) and whiffs out on treacheries and enemy when reveals."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3936065","commentId":3936065,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1588881905,"content":"> 2 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> My takes.\n> \n> Hama -- there's actually one subtle difference between my proposed errata and your version, in that I gave Hama the ability to play an *event* from the victory display and not just a tactics event.  This would make his interaction with victory display more interesting -- but it also takes him further afield from his original design.  The ability to recur (once) each copy of Keen as Lances and Out of the Wild would be a powerful aid to VD decks, and I think VD is a bit understrength.  However, you're making a lot of other cards VD-friendly in this project, and confining Hama to tactics events makes the text change true errata rather than feature creep.\n\nThanks for the clarification - looks like I missed some of the angle you were taking with the card.

Based off of your comments here, it seems like the entire point of the victory display aspect was to enable play with the other victory display decks - restricting it to Tactics cards only shuts down that entire line and leaves the cost of the fiddly bits without (almost all of) the benefit.\n\nIn that vein, what do you think of this version?\n\nn8Ps5KM.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/n8Ps5KM.jpg]\n\nOther than the victory display stuff (which was already almost entirely shut down by restricting it to Tactics), my sense is that the only thing lost is discarding cards, which made a useful combo with Elven Light.\n\n> 2 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> A defense boost for Watcher is certainly welcome, but at 3/2 he's still a bit fragile for multiple defenses, and in the absence of defending more than once he is pretty much all downside.  I think I'd be happier with him as a 3-cost 3/4 or 4/3 defender, especially if his attack could be bumped to 2 so he is more useful when defending only once.  Alternately, give him a willpower, so his ability not to exhaust to defend is useful on the *first* defense.  One other possibility is to stop keeping him as a high maintenance defender  and convert his downside into an upside -- instead of having to discard a card to keep him around, give him a response to discard a card in order to ready.\n\nJust curious - how does giving him a willpower make his ability to not exhaust to defend become more useful?\n\n> 2 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Grave Cairn is more attractive at zero, but still has the problem that the attack boost (barring Sneak Gandalf shenanigans) is likely to be minimal on characters who leave play before your turn to attack arrives (with the corner exceptions of multiple attack targets and Vassals or Riddermark Knights).  The \"normal\" pre-attack leaving of a chump blocker generally contributes 0-1 attack, and even at zero cost that's not appealing.  I think adding *both* attack and defense wouldn't be overpowered, but as you typically only use one of those, and the values are low, still is a bad fit for the chumping that fits bit thematically with the card.\n> \n> One possibility would be restricting it to an ally leaving play, and then adding the *cost* of the ally to either attack or defense.  This would allow a 2-cost chump to make a meaningful contribution, and give higher rewards for heftier allies.  But would that be too powerful for a mere leaves play, and not discarded/destroyed?\n\nThat's an interesting idea - could combine it with readying a hero, like so (I forgot to change the first occurrence of character to ally):\n\n7DVJJjy.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/7DVJJjy.jpg]\n\nBeorn on the discord had an idea to turn it into a Gondor card (although I might think that either Gondor or Rohan is a better fit) - it  might help make cards like the Minas Tirith Lampwright or Derufin (or even Damrod?) worth it.\n\ntIwDvCw.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/tIwDvCw.jpg]\n\n> 2 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Love of Tales is tough if you want to make it worth considering outside a Songs deck, although I think Drinking Song and Song of Healing will substantially increase the number of song-wielding decks.  Any reward that makes it worth considering with limited songs will make it extremely powerful in a Songs deck (though maybe that's the point?).  One way to approach it would be to have it play a card when attached, that at least makes it a cantrip in any deck that can attach it, and justify its existence in a low-song deck.  But as it's limit one and only goes on lore heroes, outside monosphere lore you would never add 3x of these to your deck as a thinner.\n\nI've had it suggested that we could remove the \"attach to a Lore hero\" restriction. And the card I put out there to get feedback on is widely considered overpowered (extra card draw for songs + the resources is really just too much). So removing the restirction plus the cantrip might be enough to get it playable, especially with Drinking Song fast becoming a staple in any deck with Lore access. Another thought might be to have it search the top 5 cards of your deck for a song when it enters play, although that might be too niche.\n\n> 2 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Short Cut is indeed a problem, since trading a location for a random reveal is typically a very bad trade, and throwing a character exhaustion and a card into the bargain is even worse.  I think the best way to improve the situation is to *weaken the random reveal*.  That's the point of a short cut, after all, to get out of doing something.  Instead of shuffling and *revealing* the top encounter card, why not shuffle and *add* the top encounter card.  If it happens to be a nasty treachery, your gamble worked, and if you get a location or enemy, maybe it's better than what you had, and you might still avoid a \"When Revealed\" or Surge.  Since the shuffle immediately precedes the card and the encounter deck will have at least one location in it, I don't think it can be gamed.\n\nThat is exactly what I was looking for.

Based off of your comments here, it seems like the entire point of the victory display aspect was to enable play with the other victory display decks - restricting it to Tactics cards only shuts down that entire line and leaves the cost of the fiddly bits without (almost all of) the benefit.\n> \n> In that vein, what do you think of this version?\n> \n> n8Ps5KM.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/n8Ps5KM.jpg]\n> \n> Other than the victory display stuff (which was already almost entirely shut down by restricting it to Tactics), my sense is that the only thing lost is discarding cards, which made a useful combo with Elven Light.\n> \n> Just curious - how does giving him a willpower make his ability to not exhaust to defend become more useful?\n> \n> That's an interesting idea - could combine it with readying a hero, like so (I forgot to change the first occurrence of character to ally):\n> \n> 7DVJJjy.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/7DVJJjy.jpg]\n> \n> Beorn on the discord had an idea to turn it into a Gondor card (although I might think that either Gondor or Rohan is a better fit) - it  might help make cards like the Minas Tirith Lampwright or Derufin (or even Damrod?) worth it.\n> \n> tIwDvCw.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/tIwDvCw.jpg]\n> \n> I've had it suggested that we could remove the \"attach to a Lore hero\" restriction. And the card I put out there to get feedback on is widely considered overpowered (extra card draw for songs + the resources is really just too much). So removing the restirction plus the cantrip might be enough to get it playable, especially with Drinking Song fast becoming a staple in any deck with Lore access. Another thought might be to have it search the top 5 cards of your deck for a song when it enters play, although that might be too niche.\n> \n> That is exactly what I was looking for. The same effect can easily be moved across to Quick Ears, preserving the symmetry and boosting both cards to more useable levels. At that point, it might actually be worth spending a resource on.\n> \n> RPKp3UU.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/RPKp3UU.jpg]\n\nThere's quoting skills that I obviously lack...\n\nFor Hama my idea to use the victory display was actually my way of trying to reduce fiddliness, and interacting with VD cards was just a side-effect.  Hama's ability in my version just treats the victory display as an extension of your hand, with the caveat that played events from there get removed -- the actual card movement from Hama's ability is actually exactly the same as it is with his original form, except that it moves from discard to victory display instead of discard to hand, and move when played from victory display to removed instead of from hand to discard.  So if it's fiddly, it's no more fiddly than Hama was to begin with, and absolutely nothing has to be tracked at all (unlike current Hama, which requires you to count something you don't normally count).\n\nWhen the errata first hit there was a lot of brainstorming on how to limit recurrence of specific cards (which was the main problem prompting the errata), but all the potential solutions were either more fiddly than original Hama, altered the timing of retrieval and play compared to original Hama, or both.  I think the Victory Display use keeps the fiddliness and timing identical to the original Hama, though your version of the wording (only tactics event) keeps the event coverage exactly the same, which mine did not.\n\nThe new proposed Hama is way less fiddly, as the card recurrence moves the card just once (discard to removal).  But it's also way less costly.  While Hama's discard ability might be an asset with Noldor and/or Elven Light, for most of Hama's decks it was a cost and a heavy cost -- you had to discard a card *and* attack just to get an event back in your hand to recur.  Playing it directly from the discard means that Hama can play every tactics event twice without waiting for Hama to attack and without reducing yoru hand size for the repeat.  Foe-Hammer now draws six cards instead of three cards.  The Eagles are Coming is immediately played twice.  I think this makes Hama a *much* more powerful toolkit hero than he ever was pre-errata; though obviously removing from the game makes him useless for playing the same event four consecutive times (let alone indefinitely).  So I suppose it depends on how you feel about Hama's original ability and cost -- if it's too weak an effect in a world where he can recur each event exactly once, the non-fiddly Hama reduces the cost and makes him stronger.  But if you like Hama's original gameplay, I think the VD-dodge comes much closer to that.  I think I like the simpler, more powerful Hama better; but I think your wording of my idea would be more appropriate as an actual Hama errata, fixing the Thicket lock without rendering Hama useless as a toolkit.\n\nFor Watcher of Brunien, adding a willpower would be useful if he not only could defend without exhausting, he could also defend while exhausted (similar to Lindon Navigator).  Then he could use his one willpower, and still defend if necessary.  Absent the defend while exhausted clause, the extra willpower does no good.\n\nOn Grave Cairn, including discarded with destroyed would make it a more useful card and set up synergy outside of chump blocking.  Any card that keys of destruction (like the badly errata-ed Horn of Gondor) will always be niche, allowing discarded allies to trigger as well opens usage much more widely.\n\nA leave-play effect confined to Gondor is useful for discardables, but the discardables are a bit thin/weak for an archtype as yet.  The main Gondor archtype is swarm and prefers to keep allies in play.  What it would really do is power up Lothiriel, though it wouldn't give her any particular incentive to send  discardables questing.  Rohan archtype would benefit from leaves play or discard-from-play triggers, though the Grave Cairn referenced is canonically for a Gondorian.  But it's also suggested by a Silvan as a time-saving measure compared to an earthen mound (also not Gondorian custom), so I don't know that this is a tribal thematic match for anybody, really.\n\nI don't think the \"add\" change is powerful enough to justify 1 cost for Short Cut while still retaining the character exhaustion.  There's approximately a 1/3rd chance that Short Cut would create a treachery whiff, and a 1/3 gamble isn't enough to make the 1-cost Lampwright popular, after all.  Even at zero it's niche.  Maybe if the character exhaustion is removed from the card and it only requires a hobbit/ranger to play I could see it at one cost.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3936219","commentId":3936219,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1588895269,"content":"> 1 hour ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> I don't think the \"add\" change is powerful enough to justify 1 cost for Short Cut while still retaining the character exhaustion.  There's approximately a 1/3rd chance that Short Cut would create a treachery whiff, and a 1/3 gamble isn't enough to make the 1-cost Lampwright popular, after all.  Even at zero it's niche.  Maybe if the character exhaustion is removed from the card and it only requires a hobbit/ranger to play I could see it at one cost.\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n\nI could be off here, but I do think it might be a little more popular in this sense than you might think.

I think you end up making the same point - the card needs to stay at 0 to be easily playable; at 1, it's niche. It was pointed out to me that failing to reveal side quests or objectives might break quests accidentally - mechanics that are intended to trigger (and may be necessary to actually make the quest work) do not. So here's the new (hopefully final?) revision of the card:\n\n23cuUiD.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/23cuUiD.jpg]\n\nOn the Watcher of the Bruinen - since that's the current focus of my energies. Whatever I do, I want to maintain the parallels with the Trollshaw Scout and the Lindon Navigator. And it seems to me that both of them suffer from the same issue as the Watcher of the Bruinen - there are other cards that just do their job better, without the downside. Most decks would rather run Galadhon Archer over the Trollshaw scout, just as most decks would rather run Robin Smallburrow, Quickbeam, or Mablung over the Lindon Navigator.\n\nI like the idea of letting the watcher defend while exhausted, and giving him a point of willpower. That makes him useful in many ways - at the very least, he's 2 cost for 1 willpower in Tactics; hardly incredible, but still better than the going average. So, something like this:\n\nxC2RvmG.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/xC2RvmG.jpg]\n\nFor reference, I'd probably adjust the Trollshaw Scout as follows:\n\nQuhTpYy.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/QuhTpYy.jpg]\n\nAnd the Lindon Navigator:\n\nFwQB1VP.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/FwQB1VP.jpg]\n\nThe basic idea is that you get an incredible deal in terms of cost-to-stat ratio, because you're paying a different cost - discarding the cards\n\nEdited May 8 by Onidsen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3936401","commentId":3936401,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1588929451,"content":"I wouldn't do anything to Love of Tales.

This is probably entirely a subjective judgement call, given my position on Dain, but I think that both Faramir and Sword that Was Broken are probably ok. Extremely powerful, yes, but not game-breakingly so. Admittedly, Dain doesn't fundamentally break the game either, but he does fundamentally warp the Dwarf trait so that it can't function without him. And it turns out that I'm much more OK with an attachment or an ally like Faramir defining a trait than I am with making a hero practically required to run a good Trait deck.\n\nThe problem with Dain is that he closed off deckbuilding space, and also that without him, Dwarf allies were generally bad. I just don't see Sword that was Broken or Faramir doing the same thing. The allies getting boosted by either effect are generally worth playing anyways, so the card design isn't getting warped significantly (although an argument could be made that Leadership allies were overcosted in the early game because of the existence of such global boosts - however, the trend did not necessarily continue, and we're fixing that anyways with this project)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3936633","commentId":3936633,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1588965738,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> If a card does not make the cut for probably the best deck it can be in, it does not have enough going for it.

\"printed\" clause certainly encourages starting with a monosphere deck rather than creating a monosphere deck -- it's not clear to me that this necessarily makes for more interesting deckbuilding -- if the card is important you probably wouldn't rely on sphere-adding, creating a combo which could be avoided with just going monosphere in the first place.  The one exception would be heroes that gain resource icons predictably like Oin and Amarthuil, and I think it is a shame that they are excluded from enabling \"printed\" cards.\n\nIn release order:\n\nMirthrandir's Advice -- clearly not a problem to not require \"printed\" Lore.  Make more heroes Lore, get more cards from a Lore card-draw event -- seems fitting.  Expanding this to Istari heroes changes little, since if Gandalf plays it with Pipe he is printed Lore and the other two Istari are already Lore.\n\nAdvance Warning -- again relaxing the \"printed\" requirement seems OK to me, it's an event and making more heroes Lore in order to play Advance Warning doesn't seem to be a problem to me.  I doubt it would expand its use much because an event wouldn't justify a combo.  Not sure what trait would thematically fit to expand use.\n\nAgainst the Shadow -- relaxing the \"printed\" requirement seems OK to me -- in fact, dropping the sphere requirement *completely* makes sense to me, since all it does is make spirit characters defend with willpower instead of defense.  Drop any sphere requirement and make it *may* use willpower, and it's still not a strong card.\n\nTrained for War -- another one that wouldn't see much usage without *any* sphere requirements.  The problem with this card has been that a deck that prefers Battle questing to Willpower questing is going to be suffering in all the turns where it *isn't* using the card, and that's still true even if you make it easier to play.\n\nStrength of Arms -- this is by far the more useful and powerful of the four monosphere events, and with a global effect and 2-cost will generally find its way into any mono-leadership deck.  Loosening this would make it attractive to leadership/leadership/lore dwarf decks using Narvi's Belt, but dwarf decks can ready the heroes too across the board for 3-cost with Lure of Moria already.  I don't think that dropping the \"printed\" causes any harm -- if it's too powerful when you've gone to the trouble to provide additional sphere-fixing, it's too powerful in mono-leadership already.\n\nAs you know, I support Mirlonde's reduction of both Silvan and Lore, and would like to see -2 for being both Silvan and Lore.  Support Silvan secrecy!\n\nLord of Morthond is conspiciously not on the list, and as an attachment *would* be worth setting up with a combo.  If loosened it should exhaust.\n\nBook of Eldacar and the other Records are also not on the list, but maybe they should be.  If you go to the trouble to provide sphere-fixing, granting a discount on the records doesn't seem like a game-breaking thing, and giving Oin/Amarthuil a discount on Book of Eldacar is just right.\n\nPelargir Shipwright would be fine with dropping the printed, since with three heroes it maxes out at 3-for-3, great value for a unique but not something that creates balance issues with sphere fixing.  I don't think expanding it to spirit/Gondor would be a problem, it's a 3-cost spirit card and wouldn't get played outside majority spirit anyways.\n\nKnight of Minas Tirith would be more interesting with dropping the printed.  What about Gondor?  As it's still a three-cost tactics card I don't see a problem -- it does open up shenanigans with Sneak Attack or Lothiriel, but I see that as a *good* thing, if Lothiriel is going to use her ability just for the engagement and free attack on a 0 wp ally, that seems fine to me.\n\nPoor errata-ed Caldara would be fine without the printed requirement, adding sphere fixing to Sword-Thain and Imrahil ally to improve her yield is not overpowered, but yet one more combo piece to fetch would not be widely used, I think.  Maybe in an Erestor deck that would draw into Song of Wisdom sooner rather than later, but I don't see expanding the Caldara lineups to non-spirit discarders as a bad thing.  What about Gondor trait?  Being able to bring them back for Gondor and/or get spirit/Gondor out of discard would make her more interesting and expand the scope of her builds without dramatically increasing her power.\n\nTactics Theoden absolutely should not have \"printed\", he should automatically boost Oin and Amarthuil (not that the latter is likely to quest), and making Songs of Battle be +1 willpower for 1 cost if Theoden is at the table seems sensible to me.  Tactics Theoden's ability currently isn't that powerful, especially since his threat cost includes his benefit to himself.  What about with boosting Rohan?  It's a fantastic thematic match -- Theoden *should* inspire all Rohirrim just by being at the table.  But is it overpowered?  It benefits primarily Grima, SpEowyn, Lothiriel with Eomer, LeEomer, Theodred and maybe Elfhelm, the other non-tactics Rohirrim generally aren't questing.  You could add more with I am Not a Stranger, but having a *reason* to play that card would be a good thing.  Looking at that list of heroes I have to say again -- that's a *fantastic* thematic match.  If he boosted all Rohan *characters* it might be a bit much (hi Dain!) but I don't see boosting all Rohan heroes as being too much even in a four player game, especially when he's overcosted by one.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3939338","commentId":3939338,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1589456400,"content":"I

Advance warning could be Lore or Ranger heroes, Trained for War could be Tactics or Warrior. Strength of Arms and Against the Shadow would be more difficult to figure out.\n\nAnd certainly, both Against the Shadow and Trained for War will need additional help beyond just relaxing the \"printed\" requirement. Trained for War was actually one of the first cards I put together for the Ancient Mathoms project - we'll see if my initial design still holds up now that we're actually getting to Heirs of Numenor. \"Play only if each hero you control has the Tactics resource icon (or Warrior trait?). Until the end of the phase, characters you control quest using attack instead of willpower.\"\n\nDoesn't do much for the card in solo play, but it turns it into a card that can let a combat deck help with a big questing push in multiplayer, and I think that's worth having in the pool.\n\nStrength of Arms is also the only one I'm worried about - it is an extremely powerful effect. On the other hand, it can take quite a bit of setup to actually get the sphere fixing card out of your deck and on the table.\n\n> 5 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Lord of Morthond is conspiciously not on the list, and as an attachment *would* be worth setting up with a combo.  If loosened it should exhaust.\n> \n> Book of Eldacar and the other Records are also not on the list, but maybe they should be.  If you go to the trouble to provide sphere-fixing, granting a discount on the records doesn't seem like a game-breaking thing, and giving Oin/Amarthuil a discount on Book of Eldacar is just right.\n\nLord of Morthond is an oversight, and I agree completely about both loosening and making it exhaust.\n\nThe Records were originally on the list, but a couple deckbuilders in the Discord pointed out that that would just make it *easier* to set up the few remaining infinite-recursion combos left in the game (all or almost all of which involve the Records). Another option, however, might be to change the records so that they just play the event from your discard pile and do not put it back on the bottom of the deck? Then reducing the cost doesn't lower the barrier to entry for infinite recursion (and even prevents much of the infinite recursion). And it doesn't hurt the general playstyle too much - with attachment recursion like the Erebor Hammersmith and Second Breakfast, you can still get a *lot* of event recursion, and it even makes the general case easier to use, because the event stays in your discard pile when you use it. (The poor Tactics Record attachment is still invalidated by Hama, but at least it has a place outside of the Hama deck).\n\n> 5 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> Pelargir Shipwright would be fine with dropping the printed, since with three heroes it maxes out at 3-for-3, great value for a unique but not something that creates balance issues with sphere fixing.  I don't think expanding it to spirit/Gondor would be a problem, it's a 3-cost spirit card and wouldn't get played outside majority spirit anyways.\n> \n> Knight of Minas Tirith would be more interesting with dropping the printed.  What about Gondor?  As it's still a three-cost tactics card I don't see a problem -- it does open up shenanigans with Sneak Attack or Lothiriel, but I see that as a *good* thing, if Lothiriel is going to use her ability just for the engagement and free attack on a 0 wp ally, that seems fine to me.\n> \n> Poor errata-ed Caldara would be fine without the printed requirement, adding sphere fixing to Sword-Thain and Imrahil ally to improve her yield is not overpowered, but yet one more combo piece to fetch would not be widely used, I think.  Maybe in an Erestor deck that would draw into Song of Wisdom sooner rather than later, but I don't see expanding the Caldara lineups to non-spirit discarders as a bad thing.  What about Gondor trait?  Being able to bring them back for Gondor and/or get spirit/Gondor out of discard would make her more interesting and expand the scope of her builds without dramatically increasing her power.\n> \n> Tactics Theoden absolutely should not have \"printed\", he should automatically boost Oin and Amarthuil (not that the latter is likely to quest), and making Songs of Battle be +1 willpower for 1 cost if Theoden is at the table seems sensible to me.  Tactics Theoden's ability currently isn't that powerful, especially since his threat cost includes his benefit to himself.  What about with boosting Rohan?  It's a fantastic thematic match -- Theoden *should* inspire all Rohirrim just by being at the table.  But is it overpowered?  It benefits primarily Grima, SpEowyn, Lothiriel with Eomer, LeEomer, Theodred and maybe Elfhelm, the other non-tactics Rohirrim generally aren't questing.  You could add more with I am Not a Stranger, but having a *reason* to play that card would be a good thing.  Looking at that list of heroes I have to say again -- that's a *fantastic* thematic match.  If he boosted all Rohan *characters* it might be a bit much (hi Dain!) but I don't see boosting all Rohan heroes as being too much even in a four player game, especially when he's overcosted by one.\n\nI agree on the remaining allies and heroes - I couldn't see broken interactions (and even the Knight of Minas Tirith isn't exceptionally good in a mono-Tactics deck, and is hardly worth playing outside of one). Thanks for that hero analysis on TaTheoden - I had been planning on putting together the full list of Rohan heroes that could benefit, but I woke up this morning to see that you had already done it. I think that looking at the list makes it clear that the power doesn't get out of control (especially since I don't plan on giving him a +1 willpower for tactics *and* +1 willpower for Rohan - just +1 willpower for each tactics *or* Rohan hero.)\n\nOn Caldara - in addition to relaxing printed sphere and adding some Gondor utility, I want to see if I can find a better way to approach that errata. Unlike Hama - who legitimately had options that could break the game (regardless of how easy it turned out to be in practice), Caldara doesn't break anything, she was just extraordinarily powerful. If she hadn't been errata'ed, the Ancient Mathoms project would probably have added her to the short list of superpowered cards that needed a nerf. The problem is that I haven't seen any good alternatives to how she could have been handled. (The only idea I've seen would be reversing a ruling about ally Imrahil, so that his ability didn't kick in until Caldara had already triggered - you could still use him as a replacement hero, but you couldn't use him to get an extra ally out of each Caldara use.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3939517","commentId":3939517,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1589478547,"content":"In other news, here are the adjusted cards from Watcher in the Water and Long Dark, based on feedback received here and elsewhere:\n\nShort Cut has been changed to trigger off of a location being revealed, to avoid being able to break the game during setup by getting rid of a setup location.

I feel like a case could be made theme-wise either way, but I'm going to go with the option that result in the smaller change to the card. We actually haven't changed the sphere of any card we've touched yet, and for this project, that might be a little bit too far.

Top 10 is probably a better call. Searching the whole deck might step on the Rivendell Minstrel's toes (and I'd love keep her and Love of Tales relevant in a song deck). But 10 is a good middle ground, I think. If it searched the whole deck, I'd agree that it would have to be a song not in play. But with just the top 10, I'm ok with finding another copy of Love of tales with the enters play response.\n\nq8dSjVT.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/q8dSjVT.jpg]\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's been a week since the last set of Ancient Mathoms cards dropped, and I think between all the feedback, we've gotten to a good place with them. Of course, only playtesting will reveal that for sure, but we've gotten as far as theorycrafting can get.\n\nSo, of course, that means that it's time to wrap up Season 2 of the Ancient Mathoms project with the cards from the Foundations of Stone and Shadow and Flame APs!\n\nWe are reaching the end of our (very short) nerf list for the Ancient Mathoms project. After this, there's only 2 cards left, and probably everyone can guess what they are! (Actually, I think that it's upthread, so I'll just note it here - Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire)\n\nBut before that, there are 3 more cards from this cycle to get the nerf.\n\nSpirit Glorfindel, of course, is the poster child for overpowered heroes. 5 threat for 3 willpower and 3 attack is incredible. However, the real problem with Glorfindel is not his low threat - his negative ability balances that out. The problem is that he came in a pack with an attachment that allows you to completely negate the negative ability with no downside. Our solution is to not let the ability be turned off. He's still ridiculously good, but you have to deal with his ability instead of just playing Light of Valinor and forgetting about it.\n\nV2wJakT.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/V2wJakT.jpg]\n\nAsfaloth is an extremely powerful card. Repeatable 2 progress on any location is an incredible ability - in fact, Caleb has mentioned in an interview that he feels it's more overpowered than the Northern Tracker, because it can clear a 4-quest point location in a single round (using Asfaloth a second time in the refresh phase). We have 2 options to tone it down. The first is to drop it down to just a single progress - taking the non-Glorfindel ability and making it universal. To compensate, we give the attached hero +1 willpower.\n\nThe other option is to keep the 2 progress and spread it across multiple locations.\n\n3faC4Gu.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/3faC4Gu.jpg]\n\nmFgJ6SV.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/mFgJ6SV.jpg]\n\nFinally, the king of overpowered cards. Vilya. There's a good reason that Vilya decks are the most powerful in the game - free cards regardless of cost can build up a board state incredibly rapidly. The problem is that there isn't a good nerf available without completely rewriting the card. Our solution was to make it cost a resource when you put the card into play - it at least makes it cost a little more when you put that 5-cost ally into play. Still totally worth it for 1 resource, but now you have to weigh keeping the resource on Elrond to use it.\n\nBTap0U8.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/BTap0U8.jpg]\n\nNow lets get on to the main attractions - cards newly minted to give them fresh relevance in the modern card pool.\n\nFirst up, the Lore attachment Healing Herbs. Exhausting a hero is not worth it to get one-time healing, even if it is to full. (Except perhaps in an emergency). We added an ability to exhaust the card to heal 1 point of damage. For a free card, it's still quite good, even if it's not in the same class as warden of healing or daughter of the nimrodel (our version, of course).\n\nUjbiUAq.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/UjbiUAq.jpg]\n\nNext is the Trollshaw Scout. We gave him a willpower, boosted his attack to 3, and gave him the ability to attack while exhausted, paralleling the Watcher of the Bruinen (and the later Lindon Navigator).\n\nQuhTpYy.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/QuhTpYy.jpg]\n\nWe Are Not Idle got hit hard with the nerf bat. We pulled back a little on that - letting you exhaust any character but limiting the total amount to 3 resources. We also limited the card draw to triggering if you actually exhaust a character, to pull back from the auto-include outside of Dwarf decks just for the thinning.\n\nDrhSFgy.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/DrhSFgy.jpg]\n\nNext are 2 events that got our standard secrecy treatment. Both were waaay overcosted outside of secrecy, but decent inside secrecy. We brought the cost down enough to hopefully make them worth playing (at least situationally) outside of secrecy. The real question is if the effects are worth it even for free. But I think they are.\n\nHQBdYzs.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/HQBdYzs.jpg]\n\nBI3yJMD.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/BI3yJMD.jpg]\n\nFinally, we have Heavy Stroke. It's...not a good card. You have to do 4 damage through an enemy's defense to make it better than Khazad Khazad, and there are very few enemies with more than 7 hit points. And really, to be more cost-effective than Khazad Khazad, you need to be doing much more than that. But it only works on a single Dwarf character, and since the nerf of the Erebor Battle Master there aren't any Dwarfs that can even get up to enough attack to make it even close to worth it, and even fewer enemies where it makes sense to use the event anyways. So we moved a different direction, more like Firefoot instead. Dealing damage to another enemy engaged with you is a much better use of the resource, and fills a niche that currently is only filled by Firefoot. It's probably a more powerful effect than Firefoot, but it's not repeatable, so I'm ok with that.\n\nV86Vrq8.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/V86Vrq8.jpg]\n\nSo - what do y'all think?\n\nThere are 3 cards from the cycle that we didn't touch but that might be worth touching. Path of Need is really expensive, but really powerful. Longbeard Elder is a fine 3 cost for 2 willpower and 2 hit points, with an interesting ability (that gets really good with scrying). And the Erebor Battle Master is still good value at 3 cost (for 5 attack - 6 when boosted by Dain!), but might be overshadowed in a Dain deck just by swarming cheaper allies (like Veteran Axehand). Like I said - what do y'all think? Do any of these 3 need extra help, or do they all have enough of a place in decks on their own?\n\nEdited May 15 by Onidsen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3939698","commentId":3939698,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1589502075,"content":"I never understood why vilya prompted to put on the bottom of your deck instead of discard.

but the trouble is that if you have a Dain-fueled dwarven swarm you probably have plenty of attack available already.  I question the need for the cap in the first place simply because the more dwarves you have, the less having massive attack values actually matters, especially when as a 3-cost tactics dwarf he's most playable in majority-tactics decks anyway.\n\nI'm not sure what I would actually like for EBM.  Maybe +1 for each tactics dwarf you control, including himself and heroes so he's minimum 2 attack and could be immediate 4 with two dwarven tactics hero.  I'm not entirely happy with that but I think he needs *something* different.  Longbeard Elder and Path of Need I think already justify their existence.\n\n \n\nEdited May 15 by dalestephenson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3939739","commentId":3939739,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1589508081,"content":"I agree about lore needing some resource generation, thats a good point.\n\nI really like the new cards. \n\nWani is very good, I like that you need to exhaust a character if you want the draw too.

I am more than halfway considering retracting the proposed nerf, after it has been pointed out to me in a number of places that Glorfindel is a lot less overpowered than he once was - in large part because his historical overuse has at least as much to do with the fact that there were very few viable Spirit options for a general-purpose deck until the game's 4th or 5th cycle. In Core, Eowyn is the only one - Dunhere is too specialized to splash and Eleanor is largely a multiplayer card. In Shadows of Mirkwood, Frodo is useful (but also the only Spirit hero that cycle). In Dwarrowdelf, the only other Spirit hero is Dwalin, whose ability is situational, so you can't just put him into a deck. In the Against the Shadow cycle, you get Spirit Pippin (one of the worst heroes in the game) and Caldara (good - not yet very good, that will require a few cycles - but only useful in a mono-spirit deck). In Ringmaker, you get Idraen and Galadriel, the first real splash options for Spirit for a long time (Idraen is fine and Galadriel is amazing). The Hobbit boxes brought Nori and Oin - useful in a Dwarf swarm, but not so much outside, and the first 2 LOTR Saga expansions brought only Fatty Bolger - another candidate for one of the worst heroes in the game. So...not a lot of options until much later in the cycle.\n\nIn addition, I've had some feedback that the Glorfindel nerf as proposed would kill the hero entirely for a number of players - just too much downside to be worth the low starting threat.\n\nSo here we go:\n\nsL5bNnx.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/sL5bNnx.jpg]\n\nAnother option might be to give Glorfindel a positive ability as well as the harsher original nerf - something mild but useful. (Of course - the easy option is to leave him the way he is, and realize that the game's power curve has crept up enough that he's not so powerful that he warps deckbuilding space anymore - and as I've said, I'm seriously considering it.)\n\nAsfaloth, on the other hand, probably stays nerfed (although remaining as-is is also on my mind). But nobody really liked any of the proposed ideas.\n\nSo, building on Dale's observation that one progress is not enough and two is too much, but 1 with a conditional 2 might work out, here is an idea:\n\nl9IgB7W.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/l9IgB7W.jpg]\n\nIt synergizes with Noldor, but not so much that it can't be played outside the trait. And it can also - finally! - go onto ally Glorfindel.\n\nNext - those Healing Herbs were far too powerful. I'd blame lack of sleep, but really it's probably that I didn't spend enough time to actually think deeply about what I was writing on the card when I made the last-minute change. Instead, here is another version - built along the lines of Dale's suggestion (and very similar to the pre-last-minute change version - I don't know what I was thinking, other than maybe not wanting to step on Athelas' toes).\n\nleJxewY.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/leJxewY.jpg]\n\nAnd there has been widespread pushback about Risk Some Light - 1 cost for scry 3 plus discard a card might actually be too cheap. And on reflection, I agree with it, although I still think that 3 is too expensive. Luckily, there is a wonderful middle ground just waiting for us.\n\nzLdy0KQ.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/zLdy0KQ.jpg]\n\nFinally, Heavy Stroke was generally well-received (except for 1 commenter who felt that being a niche card for non-immune boss enemies was exactly what the card should be - I'll just register my disagreement here and move on, noting also that it is not even really that useful against non-immune boss enemies), but it was felt that the proposed version of the card lost a lot thematically.

In this case, he can synergize with Noldor decks but struggle in non-Noldor decks. The other thing is that his ability was strengthened to include \"committing\" to the quest as opposed to exhausting to commit.

Thanks for the feedback on that, everyone.\n\nAnd the Ancient Mathoms project is back with the player cards from both Hobbit boxes! Between the two boxes, there's only 8 cards that we were wanted to touch, and a few of them we're not certain on whether they need it.\n\nThere are also multiple versions of Oin and Thror's Map, and feedback on which one is preferred by the community would be appreciated.\n\nIn addition to the cards below, we also looked at Fili and Kili - they are powerful enough as is, but we were wondering if our nerf to Leadership Dain might make it worth giving Fili and Kili a small boost (we were thinking a play-from-hand effect that boosts their willpower or attack - depending on which one you played and which one you put into play - until the end of the phase). On the other hand, they are probably good enough as is - but we'd like some community feedback on the idea.\n\nNgiiO9F.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/NgiiO9F.jpg]\n\nOin is not a bad hero, but his resource smoothing effect is niche and the attack boost really isn't needed for Dwarves - you're almost certainly looking for ally attackers if you're running tactics in a 5-dwarf deck.\n\nIn addition, he's almost completely sidelined by the hero version of Nori.\n\nWe've had 2 different ideas. The first idea was to open up a healing card for Dwarves specifically - they are one of the last traits without in-trait healing (others being Eagles, Woodmen, Outlands, and Beornings). This ability plays into the dwarf mining theme as well - thematically, the descriptions of the Dwarves from the hobbit films describes Oin as the healer, but that's thematically weak, to be sure.\n\nCp5tWO6.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/Cp5tWO6.jpg]\n\nThis version of Oin attempts to give Dwarf Mining a much-needed willpower boost. Since most Dwarf allies have lower willpower than normal to account for Dain, it's hard to do an early-game willpower ramp.\n\nOin can help bridge the gap with strong early-game questing.\n\nfhZoWyr.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/fhZoWyr.jpg]\n\nThe only thing we did to Dwalin was to give him the warrior trait. This makes him eligible for Hauberk of Mail and Raiment of War - the premier defensive attachments for allies. It also puts him in line with the Erebor Guard.\n\nThis one we're not 100% needed to be done, but it's been a slight annoyance - Dwalin could be a fine defender, but isn't eligible for the majority of defensive attachments that could go on allies.\n\nhxSRmxc.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/hxSRmxc.jpg]\n\nBombur is...an interesting hero. He makes it so you only need a single dwarf ally to get up to the 5-dwarf requirement to turn on Thorin, Ori, Oin, and many of the Dwarf allies.\n\nHowever, he is completely useless after that. Not to mention that his stats are less-than great. So basically, his ability lets you get access to a small number of hero or ally abilities a turn earlier.\n\nNow, it is incredibly thematic, so we didn't want to get rid of it. But we did want to give him another ability, and this one hits right at one of the most annoying parts of playing a dwarf mining deck - drawing into your Hidden Cache or Ered Luin Miner. There's a reason that Gandalf w/Wizard Pipe is so popular in a dwarf mining deck.\n\nSo his ability lets you shuffle a card from hand back into your deck and draw a card. It's not super powerful - ally Erestor is probably better, Lore Bilbo is definitely better, and Beravor, Gleowine, or Erestor are entirely in a league of their own. In addition, the more you use his ability, the more diluted your deck becomes in the future. But it does get cards you'd like in your deck back in there, so you can use Very Good Tale or Timely Aid or mining cards or something else to use them the way you wanted.\n\nPeyy0Y8.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/Peyy0Y8.jpg]\n\nThe stealth errata to Thror's Map was...contentiously received by the community. We had actually planned on nerfing the card as part of the project, but the actual nerf went further than we had planned on going.\n\nOne of the ideas we had discussed was reducing the cost to 0 and making it discard for the effect - it's the most like the actual errata'ed card.\n\nEdDYl8x.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/EdDYl8x.jpg]\n\nA second idea involved requiring a hero exhaustion to trigger the effect. We also gave it a willpower boost to the attached Dwarf to give it some utility outside of the travel effect.\n\nP9yprMx.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/P9yprMx.jpg]\n\nThe third idea required spending a resource from the attached hero's resource pool each time you use the map.\n \nSmW1T8j.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/SmW1T8j.jpg]\n \nExpecting Mischief is a fun card, but hard to use effectively - you end up playing it without knowing whether or not an enemy is coming up. It can be useful with scrying, but the theme is a little off - the title is about expecting mischief, but the effect requires you to either guess or already know that something is coming.\n\nWe made it a response to an enemy being revealed instead.\n \nWVZyg9X.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/WVZyg9X.jpg]\n \nFinally, ravens of the mountain. A cool idea, but in execution, less effective. Forcing you to shuffle before playing the card makes it possible for the card to do absolutely nothing, wasting the resource and the hero exhaustion you spent on it. Not worth it for the 2 or 3 progress you could get out of it. We took out that requirement.\n \ntfbGUmz.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/tfbGUmz.jpg]\n \nFor Bard the Bowman, we just cleaned up his wording to match modern phrasing. Instead of \"makes a ranged attack,\" instead its \"attacks an enemy not engaged with you.\n\nThis is part of our larger push to get consistency on the very few early cards that point to ranged attacks when they probably should point to attacking enemies not engaged with you. For example, Rivendell Bow not working with Haldir of Lorien's Combat Action.\n \nnX8FHUr.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/nX8FHUr.jpg]\n \nFor Great Yew Bow, we addressed the common problem that the Bow allows you to make attacks into the staging area but doesn't help you make those attacks effective. We made it a weapon that works with Dale or Esgaroth heroes.\n \nAs always, we'd love to hear community feedback on these!

He's in-sphere for healing, too, and is an excellent target for our new Self-Preservation. Also goes well with Dwarven Shield, to gain a resource and a card when he gets damaged.

The Against the Shadow cycle is widely considered to be the last of the cycles where a large proportion of cards don't measure up in the modern card pool. This will be reflected in future cycles in the Ancient Mathoms project - out of the entire LOTR saga (all 8 boxes!), we've identified only 8 cards that may be in need of boosting, and my cursory overview of the Ringmaker cycle shows 14 cards over the entire cycle (compared to 37 from Dwarrowdelf) that may need a touch (not all cards we identify as candidates end up getting boosted, of course).\n\nLet's start with Leadership:\n\nFirst off, we looked at Mutual Accord. It is a fascinating card, but Rohan doesn't have enough global bonuses to be worth it and Gondor doesn't have deck space to spare. It could potentially work in a dedicated fellowship, but even there, it's tricky. Honestly, though, I don't know what to do with this card. With cards like our updated We Do Not Sleep, it might have a place, but Gondor Swarms don't normally need the attack help.\n\n0ZmggSi.jpg [http://i.imgur.com/0ZmggSi.jpg] [https://imgur.com/0ZmggSi]\n\nAnyways. Just making it cantrip seemed a poor fix that doesn't address the problem with the card, which is that the 2 traits don't really synergize together. We looked into restricting it to having heroes with the 2 traits, and having it give actually good card draw, but it still made the trait-sharing a sideshow. Our current fix is still not great, but is at least interesting.\n\nAJXJIQl.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/AJXJIQl.jpg]\n\nWealth of Gondor was an easier fix. One card for 1 resource is...rough, except in an Erestor deck. So we did what we like to do with 0 cost events that are a little lackluster. We made it conditionally cantrip.\n\n0urqdZr.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/0urqdZr.jpg]\n\nA note - the Citadel Custodian came up as a card that might be worth looking at. After all, it's not awful (in fact, it's quite playable in a Gondor swarm, and synergizes nicely with A Very Good Tale), but it isn't exciting and has no ability other than the cost reduction. Since it's actually playable as-is, we have ended up not touching it for the moment, but reserve the right to come back to it (and would welcome feedback on how y'all feel about it).\n\nMoving on, there were no Tactics cards in this box that needed help, but all 3 Spirit cards were problematic in one way or another.\n\nDamrod was very difficult. Even in the new Lothiriel decks, he struggles to pull his weight. We boosted his hit points to 3, because 2 defense and 2 hit points is hardly worth having, especially on a unique character who has a discard-based ability. One of the options we explored was just to reduce his cost, which would make him useful in high player counts - 3 for 6 reduction (Greetings) is good value, and it's not too hard to see 6 enemies in staging in a 4-player game.\n\nThe other option, however, was to punch up his discard effect, which is what we ended up going with:\n\nWKWiQXx.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/WKWiQXx.jpg]\n\nIt is a powerful effect, pretty much only seen on Saruman so far. Saruman is more flexible, of course, but comes with the Doomed cost. We felt it was at least useful to a ranger deck (not a ranger trap deck, of course - that's the biggest problem ally damrod has to contend with - his hero version).\n\nNext is Blood of Numenor. This and Gondorian Fire are probably the last 2 cards we are going to give a nerf to (there might be some exceptions in later cycles, especially as the community figures out ways to break the newest set of player cards, but nothing is standing out as bonkers overpowered that we've seen).\n\nWe're approaching both the same way, so consider this a bit of a spoiler for the cards in the cycle. We decided to make the attachment a discard-to-use thing, which keeps it being very powerful, but prevents it from being a one-stop solution to all of your attack or defense needs.\n\ngfSLPND.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/gfSLPND.jpg]\n\nFinally, Light the Beacons. This card is tricky to place. It is a very powerful effect in abstract, but in practice, it becomes a bit redundant. Thematically, you are calling for aid, so we decided to parallel the send for aid sidequest. The cost is steeper, since you are paying 5 resources and exhausting a hero you control, but hopefully you are getting a high-cost ally out of it. Even in solo, it may be worth it for a 4- or 5-cost ally like Glorfindel, Legolas, or Jubayr; you are paying the ally's normal cost, plus maybe 1 (and a hero exhaust) to find it in the top 10 cards of your deck. Probably a bit dicey, though. In 2-player, it is a clear winner, and it scales up incredibly to 3- or 4- players.\n\nWe still kept the +2 defense and do not exhaust to defend, and that becomes an added bonus. Jubayr is an obvious choice here, but high-cost defensive allies like the Defender of Cair Andros, Deorwine, Gildor, Beorn, Gimli, Knight of the White Tower, etc. Honestly, any ally with 2 or more defense is a good pull with it, and the 5 cost might even be worth pulling out a cheaper ally like Defender of Rammas. The other nice thing to note is that it bypasses sphere restrictions, which can be helpful in some decks.\n\nPhOcQez.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/PhOcQez.jpg]\n\nAnd now to our last card from the box, and the only card from the Lore sphere\n\n(Should pause for a moment to note that we felt that the Ithilien Tracker is just fine. It's 2-cost for an inconsistent questing boost, but it can punch well above its cost when a high-threat enemy is revealed. Multiple copies are also good targets for a ranger bow - a little expensive for the combo, but Lore has the card draw to pull it off, at least).\n\nMaster of Lore is a fine card that got errata'ed out of the meta. Probably rightly so, given its role in an infinite loop. The nice thing is that the ability is still useful, just overcosted. Bringing the cost down to 2 makes him a perfectly playable card. (Incidentally, this goes a long way towards helping to deal with the Ithilien Tracker cost problem). On the turn after you play him, he's paid for himself, and from then on he's generating extra resources.\n\nnSBipZH.jpg [https://i.imgur.com/nSBipZH.jpg]\n\nAs always, we appreciate your input and feedback! There are a bunch of cards still to come in the cycle, including quite a few that need a lot of help (Trained for War or Against the Shadow, anyone?), and we're excited to start giving that out!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297173-ancient-mathoms/?do=findComment&comment=3977297","commentId":3977297,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1598025393,"content":"My takes --\n\nMutual Accord.  I think the synergy between Rohan/Gondor, besides being intensely thematic, is as good as you're going to get.  What better motivation for trait-sharing than the mix of a trait with global constant buffs and a trait with powerful trait-based events?  The problem I think isn't the traits, it's the timing and the sphere.  By the time Rohan can afford to play the global expensive events that boost all Rohan, Gondor has a big swarm out and no longer needs the help.  Meanwhile, on the Rohan side the card would become immediately useful as soon as Visionary Leadership is in play (which unfortunately is not at game start) -- but it's a leadership card, so it's not likely to be in the Rohan deck.  Gondor/Rohan is no less synergistic than Dwarf/Rohan would be, but if Mutual Accord worked with Dain it'd be immediately useful in a Rohan deck (with Dain at the table) as a 0-cost *spirit* event.  The way it is now, the deck that needs to play it is the deck that doesn't need it, which discourages its use outside of a dedicated fellowship.  But dedicated fellowship is the sweet spot for the card anyway, so I don't see that as a game-breaking problem.\n\nHowever, free cost reduction certainly does give an incentive for the Gondor deck to have the card and play it, even without Rohirrim at the table.  Faramir for two could benefit a lot of leadership decks.\n\nWealth of Gondor -- from unexciting card to unexciting cantrip in mono-Gondor deck.  I think it's better, but it's still a narrow use case.  If the event both added a resource and let you redistribute resources, I'd like it better.\n\nCitadel Custodian -- I'm not a fan.  It's true that once you've got enough Gondor allies out it makes for a good-value swarmer, if a boring one.  But as a swarm deck, once you've got enough allies to play Citadel Custodian cheaply you're already on the road to victory, and while you're trying to *get* to that point this overpriced ally is no help at all.  As an AVGT aid he has the same issue, he only saves you money if you *already* have enough allies to get him down cheaply, in which case AVGT is likely to be win more.  And however useful he is in exhausting for AVGT, he's no help at all when discarded by AVGT.  I usually don't bother with him in my own Gondor decks, though he did make the cut in the Stereotypical Gondor Deck.\n\nBlood (and later Fire) -- expected nerf.  This form is still a powerful one-shot effect, though as a one-shot effect I don't know that limiting to 1/hero is really necessary.\n\nLight the Beacons -- it's an interesting and powerful effect that thematically matches the card name, though obviously it scales against lower player counts.  A more solo-friendly version of the card would be X, where you pay the cost of the ally put into play (or cost+1 without hero exhaustion), though obviously it would be lower impact with just one ally rather than up to 4.  You could give +2 *and sentinel* to the allies put into play, that's probably worth doing even in the current version, so the decks who can't put an ally into play are still protected by the Beacons.\n\nMaster of Lore -- at two it's a useful card again, but I don't think the original errata was \"rightly\" done.  MOL only reduces to cost one, it was Horn of Gondor making that effective zero that allowed infinite Hammersmith playing.  At the heart of every infinite loop is card recurrence and attachments that don't exhaust, and the Master-of-Lore deck loop had both while the Master *itself* enabled neither of those.  A proper fix to Horn of Gondor (not the one it eventually got) would've broken the loop, as would removing Will of the West (eventually done) or even exhausting Legacy of Durin (eventually done).  I would be fine with the errata simply being undone for this project."}]}
