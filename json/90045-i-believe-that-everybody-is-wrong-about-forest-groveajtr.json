I know that people say that i shouldn't do it when picking the athelas up from the discard pile. And i agree with that. But why should i trigger the guarded keyword, just because i pick up the Athelas from the encounter deck? The way i see it, the card is never revealed from the encounter deck, and therefore shouldn't trigger the guarded keyword.\n\n \n\nThe FAQ (1.4) says:\n\n \n\n(1.01) Encounter Keywords Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur is revealed from the encounter deck, including during setup.\n\n \n\nAnd also:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(1.22) \"When Revealed\" Effects\n\nA card is only considered to be revealed if the card or game effect causing the card to enter play specifically uses a form of the word \"reveal\".\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nForest Grove reads:\n\n\nResponse: After the players explore Forest Grove, search the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 Athelas objective, and add it to the staging area. Then, shuffle the encounter deck.\n\n \n\nNowhere does it say reveal.\n\n \n\nIs everybody really wrong, or is there something i'm not seeing?\n\n \n\nAnd some official answer would be great! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90045-i-believe-that-everybody-is-wrong-about-forest-groveajtr/?do=findComment&comment=861198","commentId":861198,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1378726343,"content":"Yes, you are correct.
