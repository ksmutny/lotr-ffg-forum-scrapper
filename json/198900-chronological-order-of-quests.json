[https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75663-play-chronology-quests-timeline/]\n\n \n\nOf course that doesn't account for more recent quests, but in the rulesheets IIRC it at least implies that the same group of heroes from Against the Shadow moved onto Rohan afterwards for Voice of Isengard/Ringmaker and then up into Arnor for Lost Realm/Angmar Awakened, so it's just a straight progression at that point.\n\nEqually the speculation in that thread may not be in line with what the designers actually intended, but I don't think the designers have ever commented on exactly where in the 17 year period any specific quest is supposed to happen."}]}
