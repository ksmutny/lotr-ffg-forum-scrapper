The Lieutenant of Mordor killed Beregond on stage 5 but with a Song of Kings i managed to Sneak Attack Gandalf in and added 2 Vassals to add questing power at 3 each for 1 token each.

The one hero combination against Into Ithilien I have fared well with consists of Lore Aragorn, Spirit Glorfindel and Beorn (4 wins, 1 loss). If you send all three into the quest, you are pretty much guaranteed to clear the road:\n\n \n\n13 quest power (Aragorn 3, Glorfindel 3, Beorn 5, Celador 2) vs. 3 threat (Southron Company), 4 quest points and a maximum of 4 threat from another Ithilien Road or the Mumak. \n\n \n\nIf you happen to draw Haradrim Elite or Morgul Spider, Beorn will survive any undefended attack. By round two, you have six resources to get some help (e.g. Ithilien Tracker in this enemy-heavy quest, Ranger Spikes, Tactics defenders, Asfaloth for the  next time Ithilien Road shows up and the typical array of excellent cards well-known in the three spheres).\n\n \n\nKeep in mind that this is the worst possible outcome and does not account for helpful 1-cost cards you might have on your hand for the first turn.\n\n \n\nThe great thing about Aragorn is that you can reset your threat for the final quest stage if you prefer to avoid Siege (it might actually be easier given the access to multiple Defenders of Rammas and Winged Guardians)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78903-the-ongoing-pain-of-ithilien/?do=findComment&comment=851264","commentId":851264,"userName":"Rainelotr","timestamp":1377609915,"content":"That makes a lot of sense.
