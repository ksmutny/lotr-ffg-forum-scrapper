Since the resource icon indicates which sphere a hero belongs to, if a hero gains an additional resource icon from a card effect, then the hero will belong to that sphere as well. That will allow you to combo cards like Good Meal with the song cards.\nCheers,\nCaleb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84355-druadan-forest-rule-questions/?do=findComment&comment=800786","commentId":800786,"userName":"Redblock","timestamp":1370057962,"content":"Thanks for finding this, it makes card really more playable.\n\nAlso bonus watchmen question: \n\nC) how does it interact with extra hero from saga expansions (both Hobbits and upcoming Black riders), does it count as hero you control for this card, and other cards from this pack that requires all heroes to have same printed icon?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84355-druadan-forest-rule-questions/?do=findComment&comment=800966","commentId":800966,"userName":"nismojoe","timestamp":1370120724,"content":"Redblock said:\n\nThanks for finding this, it makes card really more playable.\n\nAlso bonus watchmen question: \n\nC) how does it interact with extra hero from saga expansions (both Hobbits and upcoming Black riders), does it count as hero you control for this card, and other cards from this pack that requires all heroes to have same printed icon?\n\n\n\nI would say that for as long as you control the hero with the baggins sphere, you cannot play those cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84355-druadan-forest-rule-questions/?do=findComment&comment=801107","commentId":801107,"userName":"nismojoe","timestamp":1370176977,"content":"or rather, you will not get his ability"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84355-druadan-forest-rule-questions/?do=findComment&comment=802354","commentId":802354,"userName":"asfaloth","timestamp":1370684850,"content":"I have another one.\n\nThere is a location in this adventure that reads more or less: \"every Wose enemy gains Archery 1\".\n\nIf one Wose enemy has already printed Archery 2 for instance, I guess that enemy has a total amount of Archery 3 because of the location effect. ¿Hasn't he?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84355-druadan-forest-rule-questions/?do=findComment&comment=802368","commentId":802368,"userName":"nismojoe","timestamp":1370689127,"content":"correct,  my friends and i came across an archery 12 or archery 16 round, that was fun."}]}
