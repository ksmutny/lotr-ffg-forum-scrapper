Ethir Swordsman - On it's own a good deal with 2 willpower for 2 cost. The fact that they can buff each other up makes these guys my go to option (after Arwen) for questpower in Spirit. Only downside is the one hitpoint, but not all quests punish that.\n\n \n\n4. Defender of Rammas - Playing without a good defending hero? This guy is for you! I prefer him over Winged Guardian, because he, as the honorable soldier of Gondor he is, doesn't want to be paid every time he has to do a bit of work and profits from some useful Gondor actions. The lack of sentinel prohibits a higher seeding.\n\n \n\n3. Errand-Rider - My perferred solution for resource distribution in 3 sphere decks and multiplayer. Can also take 1 damage without dying (I hate you archery!)\n\n \n\n2. Erebor Hammersmith - This stats! This effect! For 2 cost! No matter at what aspect of the card you look at it's just great and I can't remeber an other 2 cost ally with so many stats (6 in total)\n\n \n\n1. Warden of Healing - It can only be this one for me. It's literally in every lore deck I ever made since I got this guy (I tend to damage my heroes and alies quite frequently, but always want them to stay alive and well). He is just the best healer in the game for me and is completly absurd with Elrond (who I use quite often :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] ). Obvious downside is the 1 hit Point, but i can just damage a hero (if I have a choice) and heal him back up :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].\n\n \n\n \n\nAfter reading the thread before writing, not voting for Northern Tracker feels odd, but as I mostly play solo or with a friend/two-handed, he never seemed to be that good as, location control usually isn't a Problem for me/us. \n\nAlso Erebor Battle Master (THE combat ally for a dwarf deck) was close to place 5/4, but in the end to much of a niche Card.\n\nEdited November 16, 2015 by Calvadur"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193698-poll-question-non-unique-allies/?do=findComment&comment=1895437","commentId":1895437,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1447691228,"content":"In no particular order:\n\n \n\n5. - Galadriel's Handmaiden - one of my favorite Spirit allies, and pretty much all the 2 cost Silvan allies are pretty good.\n\n4. - Westfold Outrider - one of my go-to 2 cost Tactics allies, his stats are good as well as his ability.

I can even pay 1 resource from Bifur himself to add him that resource back, and Harbor Master still gets his +1 def. Well, Defender of Rammas cannot bear the Burning Brand. Also, the deck is fluent enough with resource and draw to boast a formidable ally army real fast."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193698-poll-question-non-unique-allies/?do=findComment&comment=1896990","commentId":1896990,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1447775326,"content":"100.

The really interesting thing about this poll is that, when I looked through the list of non-unique allies, there really are very few that I would label outright duds. They almost all have a role to play, at least in a particular sort of deck (see the comments about Harbor Master above). Isengard Messenger can be a killer first-turn card in a Grima deck. For 1 resource first turn, you can easily get a 3-wp ally. And at 2 hit points, he'll probably last another couple of turns and give you 2 consistently. In Lore sphere, that's a great deal. Most of the cards that people have put in their \"top\" (depends on how you count!) five list are there because of versatility -- they can be splashed into any deck with a matching sphere. However, almost any non-unique ally can be very useful in the right deck (like the Westfold horse-breeder), and some can reach super-power status like Erebor Battlemaster or Silvan Tracker. It would be interesting to run this poll again with different categories for \"top\": best versatility, most OP potential, best niche use, etc."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193698-poll-question-non-unique-allies/?do=findComment&comment=1897472","commentId":1897472,"userName":"Glowwyrm","timestamp":1447794121,"content":"In no particular order:\n \n\n1.

Derndingle Warrior: Could have put more Ents on this list but decided to pick him since he's the best non-unique.\n4.
