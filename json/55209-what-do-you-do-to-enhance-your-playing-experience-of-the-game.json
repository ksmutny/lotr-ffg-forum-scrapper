They may not be the best at winning the scenerio everytime but it's how we enjoy the game.\n\nAnother way we add to our game, like Lightdarker, we've got a podcast going (The Fellowship of the Cards) to help the community understand the Middle-Earth history and backgrounds on characters. It's a fun way for us to contribute to our community and help fellow players add to their own experiences."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55209-what-do-you-do-to-enhance-your-playing-experience-of-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=546356","commentId":546356,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1319423476,"content":"I avoid playing the soundtracks, that's all (I'm getting fits if I have to hear the Fellowship theme one more time)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55209-what-do-you-do-to-enhance-your-playing-experience-of-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=546476","commentId":546476,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1319450918,"content":" I have a mix that I will sometimes put on when I play solo.
