But for the most part, it's going to be very expensive to get just the individual cards. However, I would suggest calling FFG. I think when they say they won't replace accidental damages, they mean they don't do it for free. They would still probably be your best bet to getting the cards replaced without breaking the bank. Their customer support is amazing, I can vouch for that. I had some cards shipped where the picture was slightly off center and all they had me do was snap a picture of them and they sent me new ones within the week. Hope that helps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97348-anyway-to-replace-damaged-cards/?do=findComment&comment=958844","commentId":958844,"userName":"soldat7","timestamp":1390170601,"content":"> I recently moved back home and been playing this game past two weeks and always clean up afterexcept for last night when someone came stomping through my room this morning and damaged 6 core set cards and 2 from hobbit over hill.

Send me a PM if you have no luck. I own 3x copies of core so have a ton of spare cards in that set I'd be happy to send you. As long as you pay the postage. So assuming it isn't a uncommon or a rare, then you should be good."}]}
