I am also quite amazed by the Denethor/Asfaloth combo which makes this scenario so much easier.\n\n \n\n \n\nI'm planning a similar deck, though I think I'm going to do Legolas, Mirlonde, Denethor. Or maybe Legolas, Mirlonde, Bifur. Mostly because Legolas gives another Silvan character, ways to attack the staging area to recycle Ranger Spikes, and another way to make progress.\n\nWe'll have to see how well it works.\n\n\n\n \n\nhow would you recycle ranger spikes?  if you killed an enemy in the staging area with Legolas who had a ranger spikes attached wouldnt the spikes be discarded? if not that seems like the quite the combo.  I honestly dont know although i would think its the former"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84352-druadan-forest-full-visual-spoiler-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=801792","commentId":801792,"userName":"chrsjxn","timestamp":1370397505,"content":"Pharmboys2013 said:\n\nhow would you recycle ranger spikes?  if you killed an enemy in the staging area with Legolas who had a ranger spikes attached wouldnt the spikes be discarded? if not that seems like the quite the combo.  I honestly dont know although i would think its the former\n\n\n\nYeah, they would get discarded when the enemy is killed.

Paired her with Glorfindel (spirit) and Denethor (ok, he is no elf), sent the fellwoship into the depths of Dol Guldur. And guess what - I won half of my games so far. With only one core set. A starting threat of 19 is nice and allows you to play Resourceful or Risk some Light on your first turn. Mirlonde can also carry the Light of Valinor, she is a decent quester and attacker and she is of the lore sphere which provides you with Ranger Spikes and Asfaloth. The main problem are her only three hitpoints which make her vulnerable, but you can deal with this by adding some healing cards or Silvan Tracker (or by placing the damage on Glorfindel, that is).\n\nLove her as a hero, as she isn't too strong like Glorfindel but helps you to build certain decks.
