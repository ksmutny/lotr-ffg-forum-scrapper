When I was reading the rules I saw that we 'may' quest and off I went. We played the first few days with the idea that we could choose to quest and take more risk or we could take a round or two 'off' to deal with engaged enemies. In other words, entire Quest Phase as optional; no cards added to staging and no will-power vs threat comparison.\n\nThere was still a ticking clock in that our threat was going up at the end of each round, but it seemed very Tolkien-esque to be able to pause and gather our spirits before recklessly charging on into a quest when we're already facing enemies. We even commented on the good design that allows the players to throttle the pace of the game while still having a 'gathering threat', and we all agreed the more choices the players have the better. There was even a comment that without that choice the game would just be 'luck of the draw', because you would have to go go go even if it would be foolish to do so, and victory would have far less to do with our decisions and just whether or not we happened to have the perfect cards in our hands. It felt right that sometimes in the epic quests you take time to gather your wits and resources; and 'Once more unto the breach, dear friends' was just too fun to say after a tough round of combat and then back to questing.\n\nThen I started checking out the forums and . . .oops. Re-read the rules and while I could make a (weak) case that the total will-power of questing characters is NA rather than zero when no characters are questing and therefore it is not possible to 'compare' it to the threat in the staging area, but I could not avoid that adding cards was based on total players not total questing players. Oh well. I guess it is quest quest quest, whether you are ready or not. I don’t know, the idea that you have to go out looking for more trouble while you still have two Hill Trolls in your face doesn’t seem . . . well, ‘fun’.\n\nWe played a few the right way (yes, we even won some) and talked it out and decided that until there are allot more cards to get a usable 50 in each sphere (especially MANY more ways to bring threat down) that we will continue to play with the Quest Phase as optional. Mainly because we want more people playing this game, and sure enough, even when we won (in a rules as written game) we talked about how 'lucky' we were. Quest as optional adds a great deal of strategy while not allowing you to forget about threat. It scales very well for solo questing less, and 3 or 4 questing more. Defeat is still a real danger but it is much easier to pitch a game when you don't have to say, 'Yeah, until they get allot of expansions out you'll lose most of the time, but . . . \"\n\nAnyway, great game. I didn't mean to 'mod' it right away, but I came by it by an honest mistake, and sense it is a co-op game and my playing sphere often includes pre-teens and wives that will move on to other games they feel like they can win . . . well you understand. The more the wife plays the easier it is to spend on monthly updates. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nGame On!\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45762-quest-phase-as-optional/?do=findComment&comment=458815","commentId":458815,"userName":"DerBarchen","timestamp":1303732640,"content":"I did the exact same!

Therefore the statement almost certainly relates to locations in general terms and not just to locations during the travel phase.\n\n \n\nErgo, Legolas' ability can put progress tokens onto an active location rather than a quest if an active location is acting as a buffer against the current quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45762-quest-phase-as-optional/?do=findComment&comment=459366","commentId":459366,"userName":"wrkrparasite","timestamp":1303821076,"content":"faith_star83 said:\n\nI wonder about Legolas thought...according to the Golden Rule card text is superior to rules text.
