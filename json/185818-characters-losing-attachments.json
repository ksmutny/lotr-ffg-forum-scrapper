Is \"the day's rising\" discarded as well? The character would no longer have sentinel, but would that only matter for purposes of attachment?\n\nThanks for any help."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185818-characters-losing-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=1753214","commentId":1753214,"userName":"ppsantos","timestamp":1440469950,"content":"The play restriction \"attach to a character with sentinel\" only matters (gets checked) when playing the attachment.  After it is already attached, it does not matter anymore if the character loses the 'sentinel' ability.  The attachment will stay."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185818-characters-losing-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=1753556","commentId":1753556,"userName":"Iron Lung","timestamp":1440487543,"content":"Ah ok that's what's I thought.
