This is excluding any \"big\" expansions which contain 55 unique cards per expansion.\n\nSo at 240 cards per year, that would mean a total of roughly 1,220 unique cards every 5 years.  While that sounds like plenty, it can get repetitive after a while. Not to mention the idea of the game coming to an \"end\" after 5-7 years is not a good selling point. \n\nAnyone have any idea how many years is the license good for, or what is the likelihood that it will get renewed.  From reading the rules, I believe this LCG will be as big or perhaps a bigger seller than Warhammer Invasion. \n\nI know Game of Thrones has nothing to worry about because George R.R. Martin is very supportive with the licensing renewals. He even wanted for the RPG of AGOT to continue after its initial publisher went out of business.  But that may not be the case where LOTR is concerned, and I don't want to invest in a game with a limited lifespan.  The game should remain alive as long as it makes a satisfactory profit for the publisher, not when the license expires and is not renewed.\n\nAny thoughts or flame words about this?  Would be nice to hear from FFG regarding this issue."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44151-how-many-years-is-the-license-for-ffg-to-use-lotr-good-for/?do=findComment&comment=442104","commentId":442104,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1300788555,"content":"jcikal said:\n\nBut that may not be the case where LOTR is concerned, and I don't want to invest in a game with a limited lifespan.  The game should remain alive as long as it makes a satisfactory profit for the publisher, not when the license expires and is not renewed.\n\nAny thoughts or flame words about this?  Would be nice to hear from FFG regarding this issue.\n\n\n\nWell, considering _my_ lifespan is limited, I'm not at all worried about this.\n\nI'm also pretty sure, the license will be renewed, if the LCG is commercially successful _and_ the renewal is not too expensive."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44151-how-many-years-is-the-license-for-ffg-to-use-lotr-good-for/?do=findComment&comment=442119","commentId":442119,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1300789650,"content":"Also if it is 5-7 years as you state in your post by then we will have a lot of cards. So even if the license is not renewed the game will have more than enough stuff available for it to be playable for years to come. Just because no new stuff is made does not make a game dead, when people stop playing it, its dead.\n\nAs for FFG replying to this. Its kinda hard for them to predict what \"might\" happen in 5-7 years so don't count on it. For now enjoy the game. I don't see 5-7 years as a limited amount of time at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44151-how-many-years-is-the-license-for-ffg-to-use-lotr-good-for/?do=findComment&comment=442124","commentId":442124,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1300790288,"content":"The only think i can say is that The Hobbit  movie will come at December 2012.I dont know wich company will or allready has the license but i am sure that a new card game will come after the first movie."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44151-how-many-years-is-the-license-for-ffg-to-use-lotr-good-for/?do=findComment&comment=442140","commentId":442140,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1300791832,"content":"servant of the secret fire said:\n\nThe only think i can say is that The Hobbit  movie will come at December 2012.I dont know wich company will or allready has the license but i am sure that a new card game will come after the first movie.\n\n\n\nA completely new card game? or a Hobbit-Themed big expansion?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44151-how-many-years-is-the-license-for-ffg-to-use-lotr-good-for/?do=findComment&comment=442182","commentId":442182,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1300796283,"content":"I could see a large box expansion for this game and maybe, depending on the licensing, a TCG based on the movies.

Squatting decks were the bane of MECCG in the end, and the Balrog expansion only reinforced that with its freebies in Darkhavens like the Orcs of Moria faction.\n\n "}]}
