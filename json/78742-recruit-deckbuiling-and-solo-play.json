I've seen the gameplay vidoe and read some forums. There are many forums about deckbuilding. Is this really necessary or are the expantions playable without deckbuilding? If both can, is it more easy to play without deckbuilding? Are there rules of how many ards of a type you may add to your deck. I read that 50 cards is the minimum card seize. Is it easier to play with more cards? Another thing I read much on forums is about solo play. Is LoTR more a solo play game? Is it easier with more players and what are your thoughts is with the many expantions more playable for even 4 players?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78742-recruit-deckbuiling-and-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=758552","commentId":758552,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1359991883,"content":"Deckbuilding is almost essencial to play the game… I believe that only first core quest is doable without proper deckbuilding.\n\n \n\n \n\nRules to deck:\n\n- 50 cards minimum is a tournament rule (no official tournaments yet)\n\n-3 cards with the same title per deck\n\n-some cards have deck limitatiom inserted on card text\n\n \n\n \n\nSolo:\n\nMost quests are doable.

I am telling you, once you delve into this LCG world of LOTR… you will automatically want to enhance your experience by building your \"own\" heroes and decks… it is just so much fun, given that the whole concept of a living card game is that you receive new cards, alter your strategy, if your former one did not succeed, etc etc\n\nnew cards mean new experiences and you really will not want to rob yourself of that! I promise, it is worth the try! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\ncu and good luck, mellón!\n\n-varyon"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78742-recruit-deckbuiling-and-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=763872","commentId":763872,"userName":"Hannibal_pjv","timestamp":1361109244,"content":"One addition to the above ansvers: There normally is no any reason to use more than 50 cards. In card games it is allmost allway better to have as small deck as possible! Allso, if you are plaing with only one core set, it may be wise to start with decks that are smaller than 50 cards… The 50 card limit is for organized play, not nesessary home games, even though most of us follow that rule, but most of us allso have allmost all the possible cards, so there are more to chose from…\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78742-recruit-deckbuiling-and-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=764195","commentId":764195,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1361185120,"content":"CJMatos said:\n\nDeckbuilding is almost essencial to play the game… I believe that only first core quest is doable without proper deckbuilding.\n\n \n\n \n\nRules to deck:\n\n- 50 cards minimum is a tournament rule (no official tournaments yet)\n\n-3 cards with the same title per deck\n\n-some cards have deck limitatiom inserted on card text\n\n\n\nThat's no more than three cards with the same name per deck.
