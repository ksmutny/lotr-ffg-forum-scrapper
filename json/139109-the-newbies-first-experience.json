I wanted to get the feel of the game rules and mechanics for my first tries and so didnt want to mix things up with different quests or decks.\n\n \n\nReally enjoyed it and one both times (yes I know its a starter quest) and didnt lose any heroes.\n\n \n\nFirst game I made some early poor choices and both Gloin and Theodred took a chunk of damage as I didnt have any allies in play yet so they soaked on defensive moves. Rallied somewhat and pushed through to finally take the Beorn path on the last stage. I had managed to get the Aragorn pendant thingy attached to him to boost questing and so did a mad dash questing run to get loads of points on there to finish, while holding off a beastmaster with allies. A nasty little revealed treachery card did one damage to a load of characters (exhausted ones I think) which left Theodred on one remaining health, but he held on. Quest point were gained and game won :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nSecond game, same setup. This time I got a few allies out to soak some damage and kept heroes fresh for attacks and started much stronger. Also managed to get Aragorn pendant thingy again which helped a lot. This time, the random pick on part 3 came up as the other quest and I had 2 of 3 heroes exhausted, but I still decided to go for speed and at the quest text searched and found Ungoliant Spawn and put straight into play. On the combat phase I had enough tokens to play a Gondor Banner to up my attack (but not defense as no Gondor characters) for the round. Ungoliant Spawn came in against one of my lowly allies who soaked the damage and crumbled to nothing.  My remaining hero had his attack buffed so he did a good strike on the spider but not enough to take all that health down. Next turn, no sense in questing so everybody was ready against Ungolint Spawn. I had another gondor banner to play and so down it went sending a buff around the party. The spider received another lowly ally as its defender and the poor sole simply perished. I then exhaused every remaining card as attackers, all buffed and did enough damage to take the spider down, which was good as next turn my threat would have increased to a level that there was an orcish card sat in staging waiting to join the fray, that would not have helped. All heroes did still have some damage this game, but not near as much as the last.\n\n \n\nOverall, I had great fun!!\n\nIt involved a lot of leafing through the rulebook trying to get things right and remember rules, but that is to be expected in a new game. Generally I felt the rules played really well especially as a solo player\n\n \n\nI was very happy with the games, and am very much looking forward to getting to the point where I know the rules well enough to mix in a lot of advance cards, later quests and some considered deck building. While it did need some rule-thinking, it ran very smooth for a first attempt and I am really looking forward to the game getting better and better.\n\n \n\nMy next plan for a game session will be to try a different starter deck with passage through Mirkwood, and go straight through into journey down the anduin. That way, I stick with the same easy first encounter, but spice it with a new deck, then jump into a new adventure with that same deck afterwards. Very much looking forward to it.\n\n \n\nThought it would be nice to put a post up about this first experience and also to say thank you to all those people on the forum who have given me advice over the last two weeks in my new foray into this game. It helped me with the choice to buy the game, heped me with choices over first purchases and accessories such as sleeves, carry cases, playmats etc. All advice has been appreciated and the results of this afternoons play are that it was all worth it.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOn with the adventuring!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1510356","commentId":1510356,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1427483758,"content":"Welcome to the game!  Sounds like you had some memorable experiences.\n\n \n\nI noticed in your second game that you didn't quest at all so you could kill Ungoliant's Spawn.  I just want to make sure that you still revealed an encounter card and raised your threat for questing unsuccessfully.  That is a mistake some new players make.  You still need to do all of the questing steps even if you don't actually send anyone to the quest.\n\n \n\nBe prepared to lose repeatedly when you play Journey Down the Anduin, especially with the premade starter decks.  Don't let it discourage you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1510401","commentId":1510401,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1427485236,"content":"Don't try to play mono-tactics."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1510438","commentId":1510438,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1427486120,"content":"Glad to hear you're enjoying it so far. The Leadership deck is a good all-round deck with plenty of resources, decent questing and combat. Definitely try some of the other spheres as well - they all feel different. Though as Bullroarer hints, Tactics is difficult solo because it lacks questing power and is usually paired with another sphere, or another player plays a willpower-heavy deck.\n\n \n\nWithout spoiling it for you, JDtA is significantly harder than PtM and it may take a few tries before you find a build and strategy that works, but don't lose heart. This game just gets better the further you get and find what playstyle suits you and which cards you want to invest in.

Right now most of my concentration is on getting used to the rules.\n\n \n\nI actually didnt reveal encounter and raise threat, I thought that was done against questing characters and as none were questing, I didnt. Thanks for pointing out my error I will know next time. So basically, every turn the questing phase will reveal a card and if I dont meet that with some for of questing character I will have threat raised. Actually makes sense glad to know about that thank you. I was sure I would make some mistakes before getting used to it.\n\n \n\nI do plan on having some games with each individual mono-deck. That way I should get a feel for where they work and where they are weak. That will be my basis for then creating composite decks to try and get some good complimentay things going. Right now I dont know enough about the decks to have an informed opinion of merging them, ive not even leafed through them.\n\n \n\nThanks for the feedback and thanks for the correction too.\n\n \n\nOnwards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nEdit: Ungoliant Spawn quest having zero quest points on it did a lot for me avoiding questing on it, but had I realized I still needed to meet the threat it would have been different :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nExtra edit: thinking about it, im glad Ive been corrected on the rules aspect, though thinking about it the result would have been similar (subject to the new card) as Aragorn and Theodred questing as a combo gives a decent quest score and Theodreds ability gives aragorn an extra resource he can use to ready himself, so I was getting a good quest score with only Theodred exhausted. Theodreds attack wouldnt have affected the outcome of the spider, so as long as the encounter card from questing wasnt game-changing (which it could be) then I think it would have ended same :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited March 27, 2015 by alexbobspoons"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1510825","commentId":1510825,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1427503973,"content":"Definitely try all four starter decks.

So Id like to mono that adventure (and likely get beat) to see where I fell down and then probably adopt the Beorns Path format to have another go at it. Future advventures I want to avoid reading up on as I dont want to affect my choices in deck building (which is really hard as reading about those adventures is such fun and exciting).\n\n \n\nSo plan now:\n\n1: PTM lore mono GO2\n\n2: PTM Spirit mono GO1\n\n3: PTM Spirit mono GO2\n\n4: PTM Tactics mono GO1\n\n5: PTM Tactics mono GO2\n\n6: JDTA (leadership or spirit probably) mono\n\n7: JDTA Constructed deck (Beorns Path design)\n\n8: All other scenarios in order with constructed decks each time making adjustments (this is the point Im looking forward to even more)\n\n \n\nIn order I now have all up to and including Khazad Dum so that will be my plan (I also have Black Riders and so will slot that in somewhere along the way as some play sessions).\n\nI plan to buy packs when I have the cash available and/or they are in stock, but not introduce player cards or heroes into my collection until I am playing those scenarios. I then do want to take scenarios in order (as well as going back and replaying my favourites when I find new deck tweaks).\n\n \n\nI must admit, Leadership seem to tackle PTM pretty well even on my first go's, but Lore just really taxed me and was hard. As a starting adventure with really low difficulty rating I found this somewhat worrying, however I can imagine a Leadership deck interspersed with healing and traps from Lore would completely demolish PTM too. Its good to see your comments TwiceBornh on PTM being shocking with Lore or Tactics mono, gives me hope :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nCheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1519828","commentId":1519828,"userName":"Ryahl","timestamp":1427903183,"content":"Leadership and Lore build into a very nice two-sphere deck too.

Admittedly Gandalf turning up helped. Also, I had a nasty orc captain person who had a forced damage upon me at engagement which simply killed Denethor as I had nothing to reduce the damage (had things to heal damage but the amount killed Denethor in one go and you cant heal a dead hero). This captain seemed very tough against these heroes with I think defense of 3 and 6 damage points. Fortunately i pinned him with forest-trap which meant I only had to navigate his shadow cards each turn (im assuming he still gets dealt them even when trapped as he is still engaged with me technically).\n\nWas a ruch to the finish to get the last 10 quest tokens before the threat rose too much and yay suceeded.\n\n \n\n2:\n\nSecond game today i tried ptm with spirit mono... got smashed. Could quest pretty well but had hardly any allies to put up so once i had threef forest spiders against three heroes it wasnt good. With three attacks coming in and 3 heroes, did i defend all three and do no damage to them, with no questing raising threat, or if i attack them i am leaving undefended andthus full damage. I simply got mangled. Not enough allies to chump block or help with questing. Too many spiders too quickly.\n\n \n\nWill try ptm again mono spirit before moving onto the final sphere of tactics."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1527886","commentId":1527886,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1428192319,"content":"I'm really enjoying hearing about your initial adventures.

My brother and I tried the Passage Through Mirkwood scenario and learned the rules as we go, and I think we definitely made some errors along the way. First, it was hard to work with the resources that we generate, since each hero only produce one during the Resource phase. I know there are cards that can produce more, but we either didn't draw them or didn't have them. Also, without Allies the heroes do take a beating, and since attacking exhaust your characters you have to assign one character for questing so others can be ready for attacking later. Anyway, I think we played the game somewhat wrong but that was our observation in our first two-player game. \n\n \n\nNext time, I will incorporate other cards from the expansions and adventure packs to strengthen the decks and eliminate much of the weaknesses.\n\nEdited April 5, 2015 by Star Lord"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1528363","commentId":1528363,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1428241027,"content":"> I'm really enjoying hearing about your initial adventures.

Id think so as nothing says you cant).\n\nI do think a key to this is a good first draw on those initial staging area cards, then being able to deal with the troll quickly, so that you can rush up your 8 questing points to get on that barge and rumble through the 16 points before the staging area is too full to quest against.\n\nSome of the enemies seem pretty strong against my heros and allies in this deck too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1541691","commentId":1541691,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1428485740,"content":"If you're interested in beating Anduin straight solo using a 50-card deck using one Core set only, then these decks might be worth a look: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/108837-solo-player-one-handed-1-core-set-only-50-card-deck-that-defeated-journey-along-the-anduin/?hl=anduin.  [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/108837-solo-player-one-handed-1-core-set-only-50-card-deck-that-defeated-journey-along-the-anduin/?hl=anduin.%C2%A0]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1543192","commentId":1543192,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1428492496,"content":"Thanks i will give it a look.

I hadnt had a chance to use his ability much and his defense is great but chump blocking may have been as good. So I decided to swap him out. Berevor was the obvious choice with good all round stats and a 2 card draw ability.\n\nBut...\n\nThat would up my starting threat to get the troll attaking almost straightaway. So reluctantly I swapped out Aragorn too for Gloin.\n\n \n\nWith swapped heroes I went for go2 and won.\n\nWith a lower starting threat I had an extra turn or two before trollness. I used this extra time to get Berevor drawing cards a-plenty. She became steward of gondor so got lots of resource.\n\nMy first draw of encounter card in setup was genuinely a troll. Great luck as it meant no extra staging card and gave me extra chances to quest against low threat.\n\nBy the time the troll attacked i had a forest snare to throw at it. I had also drawn two gandalfs so played one and dropped the threat right back down then in combat gandalf helped damage. Galdalfs threat drop sort of cancelled the trolls first hit (before i snared it) with its splash damage to threat. So after that i had the troll snared with damage on it, ok threat level and all heroes in play. Not too long then to kill the troll.\n\nI got a daughter of nimrodel in play and she worked in tandem with gloin against general attacks, he took damage and gained resource while she healed the damage. Theodred got the amulet thingy so became a good questor (adding another resource), Berevor had lots of resoure and kept up card draw and i got faramir out to aid questing. Lots of card draw with lots of resource meant lots of allies, which in turn with faramir meant really high questing and with enough allies that along the raft ride i was able to keep selectively engaging enemies to keep the staging area as low as possible and block/attack them to clear them.\n\nI drew a sneak attack and nearly used it with my second galdalf against the marsh adder (first galdalf obviously in discard pile long ago) but had enough allies to save it for the final fight.\n\nBy the time i got to final fight i had an army of allies and only three enemies to engage and a threat of 43.\n\nI played the gandalf even though didnt need to, his initial damage removed one enemy and his attack another so the ally army didnt have much to do to win. Wahey.\n\nI do think i had good luck. Troll as first draw was great and troll 2 vanished as a shadow card. Gandalf were great help (thanks card draw). The nasty Orc Chieftain bloke never made it out of the encounter deck (which was very small by the end). I did have good luck.\n\nGloin teamed with a healer was awesome. Berevors card draw was so valuable too.\n\nGreat game, good win and im happy with the deck/hero tweaks i made.\n\n \n\nGoing to give the same deck another go at anduin to see how it fares when the draws are not as lucky :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited April 9, 2015 by alexbobspoons"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1556217","commentId":1556217,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1428717898,"content":"Gloin, Theodred and Beravor, eh?

Eowyn is great at questing and when she gets Lorien Guide or Northern tracker out that works great, add in Faramir and the questing goes nuclear. Theodred shunts extra resources to Eowns expensive cards which works well. All the while, Gimli can throw his two WP against the quest as well because you almost want him to take an undefended attack just to get his own attack power up and into the mix.\n\nIf you then get unexpected courage onto Gimli, you can quest with him and attack beasties (needing an undefended attack, a feint/quickstrike or a chump blocker to take the fall) Snowborn Scout is great for that chump blocker while his play-ability just adds to the questing-monster.\n\nSo throwing all this questing power into it really helps.\n\nAny clues go on Eownyn first as she isnt going to go into combat so her danger of losing is down to cards damaging all characters, or is  down to treachery cards getting rid of clues. Theodred takes the second clue... I havent got a thrid clue yet but I suspect Gimli would lose it quickly.\n\n \n\nThe extra staging cards coming up doesnt help, but the way in which they are chosen in stages 1and2 does help to avoid nasty treachery or nasty Morder Hunters. This does make some nasties easier to avoid.\n\n \n\nMy last game, I did have to engage the Mordor Hunters and they were nasty as I had two clues at that point, but it was so close to the end of the game that I met the winning quest point before they had killed me or me killed them. I still had another chump blocker though so would have almost killed them before I got to the point of needing to take damage on a hero or a valued card (Faramir, Northern Scout or Lorien Guide).\n\n \n\nIts a fun quest and its nice to be winning. Its not an eyes-closed win which is good too.\n\nI think I will play a couple more games of this with this deck before trying a different deck against it.

Because the cards you are discarding you are only \"looking\" at, they arent in play so are not revealled. The card you put into staging is  in play and revealled.

First 2 (maybe 3) were repeat losses at this scenario. Still finding it difficult. So for my last game i decided to deck redesign because i seemed to be holding cards without playing them so far.\n\nSo, i wondered what to replace. I needed tactics otherwise i had almost no attack/defense against airborne. I also wanted to keep the healing of lore and eowyns questing and card-countering, but i found i felt i missed key leadership cards like steward of gondor, celebrians stone etc.\n\nSo I kept lore and spirit too (with eowyn) and for leadership i included three copies of the song card plus three minstrels to pull them out. Then the sprinkle of leadership cards and i slimmed down some unused cards to make space.\n\nLastly, with denethor unable to defend against flying, i ditched him for berevor.\n\nIt went smooth as silk. Eowyn questing left berevor able to card draw and fairly soon i had the leadership song on eowyn as well as steward of gondor and celebrians stone. So eowyn was questing for loads, getting lots of resource and playing spirit and leadership with those resource.\n\nBerevor kept card draw which meant i pulled all three of the lore healing cards so once i was in phase 2 i was almost waiting for bird to get 6 damage before dialing it back to 1 with a lore heal.\n\nOnce i managed to get an athelas (needed to complete game) by shoving gandalf onto its guard (dol guldur beastmaster) it was a big push to the finish over two turns, questing like mad. The penultimate turn played my third lore heal which dropped the birds damage back and the last turn i got final questing points with 3 damage on bird, with one athelas meaning a win yay!\n\nVery pleased to beat it after so many tries and happy it was my own deck design too rather than a borrowed one.\n\nWhile i can now move onto the next scenario, i think i will try a couple more times first with this deck just to see if i can beat it again first :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nOnwards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited May 24, 2015 by alexbobspoons"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1635367","commentId":1635367,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1432579351,"content":"Another two games with same scenario and deck.\n\nGame 1 another win, so this deck is good for this adventure :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] played out very similar to my other success and included kicking chieftan uftacks butt.

Emyn Muil you just dump a ton on the quest, but most of it goes to waste anyway. If there's combat, it's easy. Rinse and repeat for far too long, just doing the same thing over and over.

As a solo player raising by 4 every turn is destroying, especially with treacheries raising 8 threat.\n\nWith such fast threat raise, even having 2 galadrims greetings, 3 gandalfs and 2 sneak attacks doesnt card draw enough to reduce threat enough, especially as cards cant be played at all in stage 3. Too much threat raise.\n\nLots of reliance on luck with card draw.\n\nOne game I lost on last stage when busting threat.\n\nOne game I thought i had it in the bag. Last quest phase was complete but still Attercop in play. My threat was 48 or 49 so needed to win this round. Dropped in Gandalf, did his damage to the Attercop and him and buffed Aragorn were going to be enough to kill it and win the game yay, i even had a chump blocker ready. All good..... then the shadow card raised threat and bust 50 aarrgh!\n\nSo not beat it yet.\n\nHigh fast questing with threat reduction seems the key, but my deck already has that. So im thinking card draw to get through the deck, which means Berevor (hate to loose scrying) and due to starting threat swap Aragorn for Theodred (risky as Aragorns ready skill is useful here). Might try that.\n\nAlso might ditch leadership and ho eowyn berevor denethor. The lore scout that ignores enemy defense would be good against enemies and denethor scrying, berevor card draw and eowyn questing. Maybe a song to be able to include celebrians stone, steward/gondor and sneak attack. Not sure yet.\n\nMight go a few more with the deck as-is considering ive gad two nearly wins.\n\nMan that threat increase is tough as solo.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnother three games\n\nFirst TWO both wins yay.\n\nBasically the deck ran ok, not exceptional but good enough... but the encounter deck was so kind and so the scenarios just ran well (Gollums bite still nasty)\n\nThird game was another threat bust.\n\nI imagine the later heros who reset threat to zero are handy.\n\nI think I might have won the third game too if I had been allowed to play Gandalf in stage 3 so he could threat reduce and quest high but sadly not allowed to play cards and thus threat bust with 5/7 progress on stage 3\n\nEdited June 7, 2015 by alexbobspoons"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1651993","commentId":1651993,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1433742003,"content":"Though fragile, Bilbo Baggins would be your most reliable card draw in the Core/Mirkood hero card pool… assuming you can protect or buff him up well enough.

This killed a lot of heroes. Solution being a healer (didnt always draw) or maybe i shouldve swapped in a good defender like Denethor. Cards such as feint worked well too but not always drawn.\n\n2: Location lock. Lots of high threat locations could creep in. Silution northern tracker and snowborn scout, but didnt always draw.\n\n3: Questing. The lowering of wp in stage three can be hard. Buffing up eowyn by all the usual wp methods seemed best.\n\n4: That warg that jumps back to staging if no shadow effect. So many times did this do damage then jump back before I hit it. My deck just doesnt have any contents to damage staging, so thats a weakness, though the next ap (just git ready for next gane/scenario) contained a nice little tactics card for that, so maybe next scenario will tackle that warg better.\n\nSo I did think there were quite a few difficult aspects to Redhorn, but if card draw worked, solutions worked quite well.\n\nNot generally an easy one for me, but I beat it enough to be happy to move on now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1749005","commentId":1749005,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1440237959,"content":"I totally see the darn warg with no shadows moving back to staging after resolving the attack.

Mainly boosting gimli. Lore i went for healing and forest snares, Leadership I went for buffs like celebrians stone, steward gondor as well as sneak attacks and some chump block allies. I then added a couple of songs to splash spirit with an unexpected courage and three galadhrims greetings.\n\nI then played a game.\n\nTo be honest, it didnt actually go as smooth as i had hoped and felt disasterous at first, but then it pulled back a bit and although I did still lose, it felt like I had done ok. I lost in second/final phase with six damage on the watcher who was also forest snared, so it felt like i had time to resolve things, BUT Gimli had not gained any buffing, no armour, no weapons, so doing enough damage to the watcher was going to be difficult with his regen, so i played for time hoping to buff Gimli but in the process got overwhelmed with normal enemies and lost the game.\n\nI think if I had got the watcher snared quicker, i wouldnt have lost as many chumps and then they would have handled the normal enemies, but thats the way the draw went.\n\nSo it was a loss, but ended well even if started slowly.\n\nI am not yet sure if this deck will work ok.

The initial core decks tend to be very weak until you start combining them into dual-sphere or tri-sphere and then they get stronger still when your card pool expands. But at first with core-only premade decks, they really are weak and certainly most people get smashed to bits once they try \"Journey Down The Anduin\" and tend not to even get a few turns into \"Escape From Dol Guldur\" as it is so so so hard with core decks especially solo.\n\n \n\nI myself found the Mirkwood-Cycle adventures that followed through the adventure packs of the first cycle were better balanced quests than in the core set, so if you get beat a lot, do not be discouraged :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nThere are some great guides on websites out there too.\n\n \n\nGreat to have you in the game and best of luck with your questing.

We´ve played games for 20+ years together. We played the started decks; Tactics, Lore and Leadership blowing through Mirkwood.

This time it worked well and we blew the stages 1 and 2, but at the 3rd we got a massive surge of shadow cards leaving us bruised and unable to quest well enough to keep Threat at bay.

Hmmm..\n\nGame 1\n\nTurn 1 I get the card that says choose a character and discard one from your deck and if the cost is equal of higher than your wounds, discard character. Only heroes out, so Gimli has 5 wounds, so I draw Gandalf, Gimli dead. Turn 2 I have a goblin swordsman, 3atk so Denethor defends and the shadow card adds 3atk so Denethor dead. Turn 3 I draw another goblin swordsman and a shadow card of a goblin swordsman so theres 1 in staging and 2 engaged and all I have up is... Eowyn. Eowyn died. 3 turns. What the heck!!!\n\nSo, Game 2\n\nWent much better. All the way to stage 4 before dying fully through too many enemies. Watchful eyes were on all 3 characters too though unexpected courage helped with one. Weapons n armour sank in the water too eek, good job Gimli wasnt full powered.\n\nSo now I have a feel for the quest I have designed a deck. I felt that the biggest issues were treacheries and shadow cards as well as too much enemy.\n\nSo I have buffed up Eowyn with full x3s of the spirit cancells. Also dropped lore and Denethor and added Legolas (ranged for bats) and many more tactics allies. Am slightly worried about not having miner of the hills for those watchfull eyes, but I have treachery cancellation and x2 unexpected courage so hope it will cope.\n\nNext play will see this deck have a go at Foundations of Stone. Might be tomorrow but I may play solo CoC tomorrow so not sure yet.\n\nWas an interesting quest. Felt brutal but then I seemed to limp to quest card 4 so maybe not as brutal as I first thought.

You need to take a very, very serious look at using those cards, as love it or hate, Glorfindel + Light of Valinor is the obvious solution to many quests. 5 Threat hero + 3 Willpower questing every turn + 3 Attack for combat every turn solves many, many problems.\n\n \n\nIf you swap out Eowyn for Glorfindel in your current deck you lower your starting threat by 4, lose only 1 Willpower a turn (+ some additional Willpower via Eowyn discarding) but then gain +3 Attack every turn which gives you 6 Attack with Glorfindel and Legolas assuming you can chump block or Feint. This assumes you go for Light of Valinor in your opening hand, but if you're playing Glorfindel and Light of Valinor you understand you have to mulligan for that. Glorfindel + Legolas kills many enemies that you are currently facing and then puts 2 progress on the quest from Legolas.

If you are playing Spirit, he's almost always the best hero choice. But against particularly difficult quests, this play is often essential if you want a chance to win.\n\n \n\nDon't know if you have Elrond's Council in your deck, but if not you probably ought to put that in too. It's one of the best Spirit cards in the game. Ditto the Arwen ally.\n\n \n\nAlso remember that extra Light of Valinor cards in hand are important to hold if you are up against a quest with attachment hate.

Potentially a great target for Light of Valinor too. Though personally I don't play Hero Elrond as the Vilya engine just feels too mechanical it is without a doubt one of the most powerful combos in the game if you tune your deck for it. Protector of Lorien or Eowyn can do well in that combo too as it can let you discard cards that you can't get out with Vilya. And as previously mentioned Frodo is a champ for this since you have a little room for the threat. \n\n \n\nLike I said before, in my main run through I played one of a pair of Dwarf decks. But I have also played this with Eagles and I have to say that that's a great way to get some attack on the board. Vassal and Winged Guardian are great not only for their offense and defense but if you can keep them in play until you can get an Eagle of the Misty Mountains out they can pump him up hard when they leave.Then drop Support of the Eagles on someone and you can start to really raise your attack. Sprinkle in some direct damage from Descendant of Thorondor and you have a very decent combat deck.\n\n \n\nI think I ran it with Hama for event recycling, Legolas for the ranged and weapons (you don't yet have some of the events that make this so good--but Hands Upon the Bow is still great and he always gives progress) and Imrahil for the action advantage, access to Leadership and some great chumps and utilities (Sneak Attack, Valiant Sacrifice, etc). This worked well but I had someone across playing Spirit/Lore so I don't know if it could hold together on its own...\n\n \n\nSolo's hard because you really want to run tri-sphere to maximize your access to different--very necessary--effects like readying, card draw, resource acceleration and...hitting things real hard. But running tri-sphere strangles your resource production. But Core Aragorn with Celebrian stone can help that (and don't be fooled by the waste of the resource-add, Sword That Was Broken is still worth it on Core Aragorn) and he also gives access to Steward and Sneak Attack. \n\n \n\nGood luck! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2053808","commentId":2053808,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1455573452,"content":"Victory!!!!\n\nAfter quite a break I had a game tonight.

So I didnt have enough resources or allies/cards out in play.\n\nSecond, woah once you hit stage 2 the threat in staging rockets up. My ultimate demise was a threat bust as I had heroes defending/attacking so very little questing so my own threat went up masses each turn and when starting at 30, it was only about 3 turns until bust.\n\nBut...\n\nAlso I think the suggested deck was crap for this scenario. You get enfaged by a troll with 10 health and 2 defence while his mate sits in the staging area with active card text saying only one character can attack at a time... so without ganging up this means I can only damage the troll with a character of 3 attack or more, which in this deck is only Gandalf or Thorin.\n\nWell Thorin gets sacked first troll turn and Gandalf never showed up. So I had no way at all to kill the first troll while threat just skyrocketed.\n\nWasnt happy at all with the ffg \"suggested\" deck. This quest seems very combat aimed and the deck had none of that. Due mostly to the deck, I had no way to damage them thus no way to win. Wasnt happy.\n\nSo a redesign on deck is a must. Cant be bothered right now as this game really deflated me, I never felt things looked like they could go right.\n\nIn doing a deck design for this, I think high damage from single character looks important, which does Im afraid make me think of Gimli. Gimli features so much in my deck designs Im starting to feel I rely on him too much and would rather have alternatives to get my high damage. One way is many allies but that would not work for this scenario, so it will likely be Gimli again.\n\nNever thought an ffg deck would fair so bafly against the scenario it was meant for. This makes me think the two suggested decks are supposed to be played together in a two player game, which would probably give a much beter chance as well as soooo many gandalfs, but I like single handed solo thus two decks arent for me at this stage.\n\nNot a great playthrough compared to most of mine."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2130497","commentId":2130497,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1459271414,"content":"I just looked over those deck lists.  I would have to say there is no way they were designed for solo play and definitely should be played 2 player (2 handed).   The other deck even uses your much loved Gimli."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2130559","commentId":2130559,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1459274383,"content":"I did wonder when I assembled the deck, but as I knew nothing of the scenario/adventure decided to risk it.\n\nDissapointed really, wanted to pkay this time as revommended.\n\noh well, deck designing it is :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2130706","commentId":2130706,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1459279201,"content":"A lot of people still play solo and use two decks, if that idea appeals to you.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2130923","commentId":2130923,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1459287646,"content":"> A lot of people still play solo and use two decks, if that idea appeals to you.\n\nThanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] though my plan is to go through the whole game solo single-hand and then afterwards for a refreshing difference in mechanics/play, to start over and play through from the begining two-handed.

Without something like quick-strike?\n\nI am pretty sure that's impossible as you can only declare one attack without specific Cards and there is no Action window to ready Gimli before the declaring attackers step Ends. After that step you can't declare an attack against the goblin, again.\n\n \n\nFrom the rule-book:\n\nIn order to declare an attack, a player must exhaust at least 1 ready character. A character must exhaust to be declared as an attacker. When declaring an attack, a player must also declare which enemy is the target of the attack. A player may declare multiple characters as attackers against a single enemy, pooling their attack strength into a single value.  A player has the opportunity to declare 1 attack against each enemy with which he is engaged.\n\n \n\nTo resolve an attack against an enemy, a player follows these 3 steps, in order. Players may play event cards and take actions at the end of each step.\n\n \n\n1. Declare target of attack, and declare attackers. A player does this by choosing 1 enemy with whom he is currently engaged, and exhausting any number of characters as attackers.\n\n \n\n2. Determine attack strength. Add up the total attack strength (Û) of the attacking characters that have been declared against that target.\n\n \n\n3. Determine combat damage. This is done by subtracting the target enemy’s defense strength (Ú) from the combined Û of all the attacking characters. The remaining value is the amount of damage that is immediately dealt to the target. If the Ú is equal to or higher than the Û, no damage is dealt.\n\n \n\nCharacters that are declared as attackers are only considered to be attacking through the resolution of the attack. Once an attack has resolved, the characters are no longer considered “attackers,” but they do remain exhausted.\n\n \n\nAfter a player’s first attack has resolved, he can declare another attack against any eligible enemy target that he has not yet attacked this round. Each player can declare an attack (with any number of eligible attackers he controls) against each enemy with which he is engaged once each round. Once all of a player’s attacks resolve, play proceeds clockwise from the first player until all players have resolved all of their attacks.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGood Job anyway staying in the game after Dain died so early on and facing 3 giants!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2387863","commentId":2387863,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1472320722,"content":"**** I missed that, I was going by the page 21 diagram play where you can fully resolve an attack, then afterwards declare a new attack/target and resolve that... combined with the play summary diagram showing the steps as green thus ok to play cards/abilities between steps of a phase.\n\nSo Gimli is fine to attack the goblin fully, Then ready with unexpected courage, then declare and carry out a second attack.... however what I missed was the \"not yet attacked this round\" so while Gimli could have hit another goblin, he couldnt have hit the same goblin.\n\nOops.\n\nThinking on it, this would have left the great goblin in play for another round, so fili would have most likely chump blocked and died before Gimli finished the great goblin.

Wasnt planning two handed, simply try each and see how they went single handed.\n\n \n\nMy theory was the simple, cram the deck full of as many allies as I could. I aimed for 2 and 3 cost allies (couple of 4's). When I laid out all such cards, adding Gandalf meant I was a few cards short of 50 and so I added about 5 utility cards such as unexpected courage for spirit and healing cards for lore. (Bear in mind I am playing progression so only have so many allies \"available\").\n\n \n\nHeroes:\n\nLore = Denethor, Aragorn, Berevor\n\nSpirit = Eowyn, Glorfindel, Frodo\n\n \n\nTried the Spirit first, just now. Smashed the quest lol.\n\n \n\n3 mono heroes meant lots of resource to get cards out compared to my usual tri-sphere.\n\nLots of allies out means lots of chump blockers and lots and lots of questing, so the enemies werent too bad and the questing went well.\n\nMono sphere mostly allies of 2 or 3 meant riddles were a doddle :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nOnly scary moment was the last phase where I quested everyone for a total of about 21 haha but the treachery came out that gave -1 to each characters questing and so it reduced it way down to about 14 so instead of steamrolling the quest in one turn, I ended up still on the quest with all characters exhausted (apart from Glorfindel who had unexpected courage) and so the amount of damage I took from the few engaged goblins nearly killed some heroes. All heroes from this ended up 1 damage from death apart from Bilbo who was 2 from death... but they all survived.\n\nNext round they all quested again and smashed the progress limit to bits.\n\n \n\nSo, I have to be honest here, I was playing this with a view to win once and put it firmly behind me and move on. But I really enjoyed this quest with this deck lol. Just shows how a deck that works ok with a quest turns it from a hard slog to a fun tactical challenge where you enjoy it because you have a chance to win all throughout.\n\n \n\nSo right now, I am feeling that before moving on, I want to throw my Spirit deck against it at least one more time and also, seeing as I built it, Im thinking of giving the lore deck a go too.\n\nI dont think the lore will do as well because it isnt as strong at questing and Glorfindel was pretty useful plus Frodos defense was good and Eownys questing excelled as usual, though the healing of lore may well be very good to occupy the goblins.\n\nIm thinking anothe go at Spirit, then trial the Lore deck (and maybe lose) then another Spirit to bring back up the do-able challenge.\n\n \n\nI do enjoy the deck building puzzle of this game, but I also really enjoy it when you get a deck you feel is balanced for the quest, as then you can forget about deck building/tweaking and just play the game for the experience of playing the game. All that lies between defeat/victory are the random deals and your personal choices. makes the \"game\" aspect more fun.\n\n \n\nSo I eat my words. My post above told how I thought this quest was awful... but I thoroughly enjoyed tonight and really do want to have more plays at this quest now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nFeeling really good about how fun that was :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\nEDIT: PS my finishing threat was 41, which I think was pretty high considering the low start of 21 but there were a lot of things, including Frodo and Glorfindel, that raised threat a lot lol\n\nEdited October 17, 2016 by alexbobspoons"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2469147","commentId":2469147,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1477083955,"content":"Huh\n\nSo I decided to trial the Lore deck so I could get it out of the way and give Spirit another go, and also smashed the quest to pieces.\n\n \n\nMy end threat was 30, which was my starting threat :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] as I didnt use Aragorns ability until the last turn so thought hey why not lol.\n\n \n\nIt was an ally fest, ran out of width on my mat.

Then to decide what scenario.\n\nSo chronologically its either Heirs of Numenor of Battle of Laketown. Battle has quite a hard rep but so does Heirs. o I plumped for Heors and assembled the firs quest.\n\nGot SMASHED!\n\nFirst go stages a thug, then the taven disscard effect put up another thug and then the first questing phase pops up a brigand.

Eowyn was useless for once hehe.\n\nSo did I enjoy it?

My initial thoughts are to try out a mono-tactics but tactics with leadership may work nice too. Then again tactics with lore for healing could be good too. Not thinking about resource generation just yet. I think I will try mono tactics and see what happens. So who to pick?? Well Gimli is my go-to and I often like Legolas, so I will have a shuffe throug the cards and maybe try a brand new tactics hero I havent tried before :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nHope everyone is well! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nAlex"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2636184","commentId":2636184,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1486843975,"content":"Yeah, Heirs can be very hard :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] \n\nTactics definitely is much more useful at least for the box than in other quests, just due to the higher attack/defense values on their Cards.

I had a great fun game with my new deck. It did quite well but still failed.\n\nA late introduction of collateral damage cause 8 threat increase and bust the 50 limit argh, it was going ok until that point I was only 5 progress away from advancing to the last stage.\n\n \n\nI think I had too much utility in my deck and not enough allies. More allies would increase the combat and also increase questing ability. I seemed to have utility cards spare in my hand so thats the direction I will redesign  the deck. I did find resource an issue but unless I introduce Leadership I done see an easy solution to that.\n\nI did find I was over compensaated for combat.

I had 2 of the 15 progress so didnt do too badly considering it was the last stage.\n\nWent quite well, though collateral damage REALLY damages you. I cancelled on with a card but there are just so many. Also, discarding attachments was a kicker as I lost light of valinor from Glorfindel which was handily allowing him to quest without raising threat.\n\nQuesting on the final stage was difficult as I had lost Legolas right at the end of stage 2 due to a card effect causing damage (that I cant remember) so managing to balance attack/defend/quest with just the two heroes was difficult, especially with them loading on the freebie attacks due to the quest effect which thinned out my measly defenders.\n\n \n\nI dont think with Legolas alive I would have managed to get the extra 13 progress at the rate I was taking hits from enemies. So I still think the deck needs tweaking. Again I still feel I need more allies. More allies gives more power to attack, defence and questing and I think extra numbers of bodies would make the difference in this quest. Attachments I can thin out, I think weapons are too expensive in this quest for what you gain (though if I ever get Citadel Plate onto Gimli he will demolish questing the \"battle\" stages) and born aloft (intention Gandalf) isnt getting used. Similarly although Ive failed through threat busting, I think Galhadrims Greetings is too expensive for the 1 spirit hero. So I think I need to trim out things like that and add in allies. Maybe more cancellation for spirit too though I dont want to affect the consistency of the deck by going too far over 50 cards (Im always around 53-55 it seems).\n\nIt did go fun though, I felt I had a slim chance up until Legolas died and quest 3 asked for so much progress.\n\n \n\nDefinite deck tweak before a re-attempt :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2647949","commentId":2647949,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1487517906,"content":"Ah the joys of collateral damage :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png] I think it is among the most annoying Cards in the game as it is just a horrible way to loose.

Can't seem to get enough out early enough. The quest starts with an enemy, then Quest rules potentially adds another at first Quest stage, then first questing can add something else to staging too.  So on turn one you can have three cards in staging before you've built enough resource to pay out cards of your own. \n\nI did ok for a bit but fell to too much combat. Died. \n\nI did feel that legolas was the weak link, he went down fast without giving much for his stats/abilities leaving me with only two heroes. \n\nGame two,  the first turn produced an extra enemy and the quest card was an enemy,  so three enemies and as yet I had not enough resource to get allies out and had committed one hero to quest,  so turn one legolas died as I couldn't defend enough. Sheesh this was not good. Following turns were similar and I died on turn three. \n\n \n\nSo I have decided that defending is the big weakness and so as many state,  Boromir will be tried on this quest (I've never used him before). I'm a bit worried about threat but am taking three Galhadrims Greetings, and am also worried that his defense is 2 but most enemies hit for 3 and as I play progression I'm not sure what will raise his defense to 3 to combat. Maybe a dunedain card which may mean I have to swap out a character for a leadership one. I don't think I can swap glorfindel/spirit so Gimli may have to make way for a leadership hero.  If so,  I may need to slim down the tactics allies for leadership allies due to resource, or may include songs to redress that balance,  not sure yet. \n\n \n\nSheesh this is a hard quest.  HoN has a reputation for difficulty but I hope it's level doesn't spoil the game for me. \n\n \n\nOnwards.  I have swapped legolas for boromir but no other deck tweaks yet.

You should bring some cancellation and/or threat reduction, too. So as long as you mulligan for your combat cards and draw into your willpower later (so bring some card draw, too :D) you should be good. There are only really two scenarios, which are bad: 1st You don't start with good combat cards, what is just unlucky and shouldn't happen very often, 2nd you advance to the last stage without enough willpower, what is easily prevented by not picking up the scroll in stage 2 iirc, so just sit there as long as you can do the battle questing and than pick the scroll up once enough willpower hits the table.\n\nI agree that the box quests are some of the hardest of the cycle. Most APs are either easier (e.g. Amon Din) or at least fairer designed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2735996","commentId":2735996,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1492416979,"content":"Thanks all. \n\nThing is, the enemies are just tough enough to need 2 characters (or turns) to kill (Gimli-aside) while also being damaging enough to kill most allies.

I find many scenarios have what I think to be \"tricks\" whereby they arent just high damage or big enemies but they do game altering things like Umbar Assassin does, or the lose your hand, or the kill all allies (okay 1 damage to all allies) and in most quests you build solutions into your deck.

While I have solutions in my deck, its the luck of the draw if my solutions are not out yet when they appear and I dont have room for draw acceleration to the amount I would need for my trick counters.\n\nMakes for a game where all is good and then you are sunk on the draw of one card.\n\nOther scenarios can be frustrating but then after you build in trick-solutions all of a sudden they become more enjoyable and the pressure eases.

Gimli was fully wounded but Glorfindel got light of valinor. A sneak attack Gandalf helped. Was a slow slog and the round that I completed stage1 Celador died, so my first go at the standard stage2.\n\nThis also was a long slog as I had been aiming for using willpower and so the siege keyword was a pain. I had 3 Elronds Council in hand but didnt want to lower threat without using the willpower gain.\n\nI slogged through, playing a standard Gandalf to boost defense as I was low on defense, but Defender of Ramas came to my aid as a solid 4. Nasty Morgul Spider attacked but I defended with Gondorian Spearman and quick-strike with Gimli to dispatch it. I just missed out with 8 progress but the followig turn the encounter card was a location so managed to get to stage 4, though I had Southron Company engaged.\n\n \n\nRight!! Willpower now huh. My threat was 36 so only 1 away from siege but I played all 3 Ellronds Councils for a 3WP gain and a threat lower of total 9 haha.\n\nI then played out another Gandalf onto the table, exhaused Faramir for his WP bonus and then quested with everybody. My total WP was about 21 and so it handled the 1 threat of another Southron Company and blitzed the 15 progress needed to win HAHA!

Khazad! card to take most (not all) off Smaug in a single turn once I get into the final stage. (Bearing in mind all these cards are played on the hero, not the target, so Smaug wouldnt be immune to any of this).\n\n \n\nAt this point, my one go at the quest skyrocketed the threat, so maybe Frodo blocking was a poor idea, or maybe its just that I didnt get my threat reduction into play :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Maybe I should have swapped Gandalfs for core to reduce threat.\n\nSo too much threat not enough questing was the main issue in my first go.\n\nWill give the same deck another try before deciding properly what goes wrong and how to tweak/change it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2904926","commentId":2904926,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1501373878,"content":"The best things is to not have to blocked at all.

Allies don't die if you care enough..\n\nOnly because if Gimli gets to do someing like 11 attack, that's high damage against smaug if the objective card reduces his defense, so being able to do the same amount of damage with a single card at zero cost is pretty good. \n\nTo get allies out of equal damage is a lot of resource and then there's the trick of keeping them alive long enough. If Smaug engages that's one ally gone. Most heroes are around 10 cost so keeping the threat really down can be hard. Glorfinfel is a good bet but unless valinor goes on him, he is raising threat every quest phase. I'm also not sure a chunk of good questing spirit allies can do enough damage thigh they would quest well.\n\nI do like your idea though and it has obviously worked for you!

Almost completed stage 1 before threat bust.\n\nNever got Valinor on Glorfindel so threat was rising quickly. Tried to keep under control but nope.\n\nToo much damage and not enough questing progress.\n\n \n\nVery hard.\n\nI know this is intended as a hard quest, but after playing the 3 HoN quests and then this, 4 of the hardest quests I have ever played is tough going. I can see why the internet records a large group of players quitting the game at this point in its history, there just doesnt seem much let-up. Im still enjoying it, but not as much as I used to. Right now, every card from the decks seems crucial, every decision a game-breaker. The win margin seems so slight and so dependant on draw, the relaxed fun of the game isnt there in these scenarios for me.\n\nIn one sense thats the way it SHOULD be in a dragon-attacked town, so its well designed, BUT I  think released at a bad time. 4 hard quests in a row is simply soul-sapping. Either Laketown would have been better a little later, or HoN deserved one or two easier quests for its box I think.\n\n \n\nI am going to stick with this scenario for now, I have hopes (low) to beat, but I think its days are numbered before I throw in the towel and move on (So far Dol Guldur is the only time I have done that). This saddens me, but I would rather keep enjoying my game then end up run down. The game needs to be challengin, but fun too. For me these 4 quests back-to-back are too brutal. I couldnt even dream to think of a thematic deck for these.\n\n \n\nIll carry on with my current deck as I think its capable of defeating the scenario, but I do have a side-though that I might try. Leadership and Lore (not sure if I would have enough questing) so that I could get Gloin with citadel plate to defend the dragon without raising threat.. Then Lore healers to get him back healthy (all the while generating big resource to get extra cards into play). Plate is expensive and this relies on getting out healer cards while maintaining a good questing score, so I dont know if it can work at all.

Obviously dependant on getting steward out of the deck but both games that happened. I think I put a full 3 copies in."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=3582750","commentId":3582750,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1546727639,"content":"You mean Envoy of Pelargir. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=3582994","commentId":3582994,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1546770684,"content":"> 11 hours ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> You mean Envoy of Pelargir. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nThat's the girl, she's a star "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=3940072","commentId":3940072,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1589573848,"content":"So today I started playing again.\n\n \n\nPlayed Battle of Five Armies for the first time and used the previous deck to get a feel for it.

Had plenty of resources but couldnt play much.

At the start there is a scrabble to get questing progress on all three stages to avoid the bad effects, while also encounter cards are removing the progress AND also have additional bad effects if any stage has zero progress on it. So this starting point is MANIC. But, once you have yourself set up with a couple of progress on each stage then the negative effects fall from loads to pretty much zero and you can just bash away at the remaining part of the quest steadily.\n\n \n\nThe goblin surge remains a hard thing to beat. The big bad guy went down in one hit from a powered up gimli with glorfindel.\n\n \n\nThink I will move on from this, the quest is fun but the starting panic is too stressful to make the whole quest completely enjoyable."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=3947871","commentId":3947871,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1591101753,"content":"Thread seeming quite these days :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\nAnyways..\n\nHad another go, horrible starting hand after mulligan but I pulled it back some. Had the three intermediate stages with 9-7-1 progress upon the end, so not quite managed the last stage. I bust threat at 50 bt Aragorn and Glorfindel had died that turn anyway as I knew I couldnt win so did a blaze of glory finish. Bilbo and Gimil had one health remaining each.\n\n \n\nI still dislike the pressure on starting with this quest. If you dont get a good enough start (starting hand) then the game punishes you so hard that it seems too hard to pull back from. True that deck design could try to get cards out fast, but I am not too good at that part of a deck design."}]}
