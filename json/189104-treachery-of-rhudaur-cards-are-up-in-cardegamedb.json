Awesome pack for player cards and the quest looks really cool as well. I don't know how much of a fan I am of fighting Thaurdir again in the exact same card form. He is literally the exact same boss from Deadmen's Dike, when we fought Bellach twice we at least got different versions of him with different art.... this time its the same art and exact same card. We already get that a fair bit these days with objective allies (Nalir identical in multiple quests in ring maker cycle, Iarion in two quests of Lost realm which is not as bad however at least it is in the one box and now same version of Amarthiul in Wastes, Across the Ettenmoors AND now Treachery of Rhudaur), do we really want/need this to happen with bosses as well....?\n\nThe good thing about Amarthiul is that with his very nice 3 attack and defense and ability to swap control when you need it most (when enemies engage) he allows the developers to make enemies tougher, more frequent and more daunting as you essentially have an extra combat oriented hero (minus the resources) for the whole quest.\n\nEdited September 22, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189104-treachery-of-rhudaur-cards-are-up-in-cardegamedb/?do=findComment&comment=1811416","commentId":1811416,"userName":"midwestborn86","timestamp":1442907628,"content":"This may be the most powerful pack for deck augmenting ever.
