When you said all 4 teams made it through Dead Marshes and on did you guys start with Passage through Mirkwood and keep questing through the cycle? Or did you play scenario by scenario separately? I am interested in stringing multiple quests together but not sure how to set up after one scenario is beat....heal heroes or leave damage...leave allies in play or start all over?

I've stayed in Thailand for quite a while. Not much in Krung Thep really, but in Chaing Mai I've found the people very friendly and outgoing with a Farang. And along the coast in the south, and on the islands, it was even common to play games in a bar. Had loads of fun playing Jenga and drinking with locals. So why not try lotr lcg outdoors?
