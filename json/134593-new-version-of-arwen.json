She did multiple depictions of Arwen so I would not be surprised at all if it were from the Dwarrowdelf days. However, I would also not be surprised to see an Arwen hero in the next cycle due to the bit of focus on Noldor."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134593-new-version-of-arwen/?do=findComment&comment=1444215","commentId":1444215,"userName":"Ryodu","timestamp":1423624029,"content":"Not to mention she'd make a great Hero card. Not only would it be fair to eventually see a Hero Arwen but it would change the meta in an interesting way, forcing spirit players to find a substitute for Arwen Ally if the Hero version is out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134593-new-version-of-arwen/?do=findComment&comment=1444550","commentId":1444550,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1423650038,"content":"Oh wow, thanks for bringing this to my attention!
