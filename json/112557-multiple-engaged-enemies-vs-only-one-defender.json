If you don't declare defender, then resolve the attack as normal, and as undefended.\n\nIt is really a bad idea to have more engaged enemies than ready character to defend, but sometimes, it is not from your own will. Then you're really close to your next game were you will be more lucky, perhaps :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112557-multiple-engaged-enemies-vs-only-one-defender/?do=findComment&comment=1191608","commentId":1191608,"userName":"NILTON","timestamp":1407637686,"content":"Alright, dear alogos,\n\nThank you so much for your reply...\n\n \n\nIndeed it isn't much fun having two or three beasts engaging one lonely Thalin...\n\nThis game is amazing!
