Any and all help is appreciated!\n\n\n\n \n\nWelcome to the game!  I'll do my best here:\n\nYes, attachments and characters exhaust independently of one another (if it helps, consider a card like Unexpected Courage - it'd be pretty weird if the game didn't work like that).\n\nOccasionally a card with cost X will truly be variable (search the top X cards of your deck), but it's far more common for X to be defined by the card's own text (X is the cost of the ally you wish to put into play, for example).\n\nIf a card deals X damage, you're correct that that bypasses defense.  Unfortunately for Hummerhorns, he is considered to engage a player regardless of who initiated the engaging - basically, if you engage Hummerhorns, 5 damage.  If he engages you, 5 damage.  He is a beast.\n\nYou're right that in general, your characters can only attack enemies that you are engaged with.  Essentially, after the enemies attack you, you choose which enemy you'd like to attack, then exhaust any number of characters to attack that enemy.  Then you may choose a different enemy engaged with you and repeat the process.\n\nRanged is a keyword that breaks the rules a little bit.  I haven't played Death Angel, but it sounds similar.  Basically, a Ranged character can pretend that they are in front of any other player.  If that player declares an attack, your Ranged character can exhaust to join in.  Or, when you're declaring attacks, your Ranged characters can declare attacks on ANY engaged enemy (although not ones in the staging area).  Just like any other attack, your character will exhaust, so if you want to use them more than once, you need to ready them.\n\nThe co-op aspect comes from things like Ranged and your ability to play events and attachments to help out your opponents.  Also, trying to determine which player can engage which enemies to optimal effect is a huge co-op event.\n\nFinally, booored is wrong about this.  Each player can only attack each enemy once per turn.  If my Legolas attacks the Cave Troll alone, my Boromir can't attack it again later.  However, if Boromir attacks the Cave Troll, I can still ready Boromir (using his ability) and have him attack Mr. Fluffy the Friendly Warg on the same turn.\n\nHope that helps!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62203-combat-clarity-ranged-melee-tapping-untapping/?do=findComment&comment=609082","commentId":609082,"userName":"guest479094","timestamp":1332430850,"content":"radiskull said:\n\nFinally, booored is wrong about this.  Each player can only attack each enemy once per turn.  If my Legolas attacks the Cave Troll alone, my Boromir can't attack it again later.  However, if Boromir attacks the Cave Troll, I can still ready Boromir (using his ability) and have him attack Mr. Fluffy the Friendly Warg on the same turn.\n\n\n\nWhen he says that each player can only attack each enemy once per turn he means that each player may initiate an attack against an enemy once per turn - that is, each player may declare each enemy as a target only once per turn (see step 1 of the attacking enemies in the rules). However, this does not restrict characters from attacking an enemy more than once in a turn *as long as the attacks are initiated by different players*. Note this distinction only matters if you have characters who are \"ranged\".\n\nFor example:\n\nPlayer A controls Legolas (who is ranged). Player B is engaged with Hill Troll. On his turn to attack, Player A may choose to attack the Hill Troll and declare Legolas as the attacker. Now, normally this would not be allowed as players are restricted to targeting only enemies they themselves are engaged with and characters may only engage enemies their controlling player is engaged with, but ranged characters bypass both restrictions to make this possible. Then after this attack the player may use some card effect to ready Legolas (exhaust Unexpected Courage attached to Legolas for example).\n\nPlayer A may not choose Hill Troll as the target of an attack for the rest of this turn. However, on his turn to attack, Player B may himself designate Hill Troll as the target of an attack --> AND Player A may still declare Legolas as one of the attackers <-- (again, this would not normally be possible but \"ranged\" allows characters to be declared as attackers on other players attacks as well).\n\nHope that helps clarify this tricky distinction."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62203-combat-clarity-ranged-melee-tapping-untapping/?do=findComment&comment=609172","commentId":609172,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1332449138,"content":"<deleted as forum ****** up>"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62203-combat-clarity-ranged-melee-tapping-untapping/?do=findComment&comment=609176","commentId":609176,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1332449824,"content":"radiskull said:\n\n \n\nFinally, booored is wrong about this.  Each player can only attack each enemy once per turn.  If my Legolas attacks the Cave Troll alone, my Boromir can't attack it again later.  However, if Boromir attacks the Cave Troll, I can still ready Boromir (using his ability) and have him attack Mr. Fluffy the Friendly Warg on the same turn.\n\n \n\n \n\nI have never said anything different.You can not attach the SAME monster twice with the same character is what I said.

The restriction is solely for players declaring attacks, not for characters participating in attacks.

I am really not seeing the room for misunderstanding."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62203-combat-clarity-ranged-melee-tapping-untapping/?do=findComment&comment=609343","commentId":609343,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1332495834,"content":" Welcome Thia Halmades !\n\nWelcome to the boards, and to the game...the more the merrier !\n\nCan't add much more to what radiskull has said, he summed it all pretty well. As for the coop aspect of the game and combat the Encounter phase (right before combat itself), in which you choose who engages who before making the engagement checks, is where the magic happens. There, the players share the burden according to their strenghts, and spread around the enemy's troops. That's why mutliplayer is so fun : you can have a dedicated Tactics deck geared solely towards killing the baddies. When you're in these shoes, you really feel like you're helping the team.\n\nRanged is a nice keyword for coop, but do not forget Sentinel, which enables a character to defend attacks on other players. It frees up attackers and can save a teammate.\n\nAs for the whole thing concerning how many times enemies can be attacked, I will side with radiskull and Anodos on that one. For instance :\n\n-Two player game, player 1 has Legolas among his heroes (who is a ranged hero), and player 2 doesn't have a Ranged character, but has a mean of readying a character. This round, Player 2 is the First player.\n\n-After the Encounter phase, player 2 is engaged with one enemy. The enemy attacks, everything is resolved, and we go on to player attacks.\n\n-Player 2 is the first player this turn, and declares an attack on the enemy engaged with him (which is a very tough monster, maybe a troll). As he declares his attack, player 1 has the option to join in the attack and declare Legolas as an attacker because he has the Ranged keyword. The two team up, seriously damaging the enemy, but they are unable to finish him off, he has a few HP left. Since Player 2 can only declare one attack per enemy he is engaged with, he can do no more, and it is now Player 1's turn.\n\n-On Player 1's turn, Player 2 plays a card that readies Legolas. Legolas has juuuust enough firepower to finish off the monster engaged with Player 2. As per the rules, Player 1 can only declare one attack per monster, BUT nothing forbids Legolas from attacking the monster again since he has not, as a player, declared an attack against him so far : he only helped out on Player 2's attack. Thus, through his Ranged keyword, Legolas is declared as an attacker on the enemy engaged with Player 2, and finishes him off.\n\nSo there you have it. Ranged characters can declare attacks on their own against enemies engaged with other players, or participate in attacks declared by other players. You can only declare one attack per monster as a player, but characters can attack the same monster more than once in the same round, if you can find the means to ready them and if the circumstances and rules permit.\n\nP.S. In retrospect, the exemple supplied by Anodos was clearer :-p"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62203-combat-clarity-ranged-melee-tapping-untapping/?do=findComment&comment=609387","commentId":609387,"userName":"Thia Halmades","timestamp":1332503553,"content":"Hey team,\n\nFirst, thanks for the warm welcome! I always enjoy a good community, and I was lurking long before I was posting. I got into LOTR:TCG ... well, by accident, actually, because I love cooperative games, and I was really missing a lot of the 'feel' of MTG, but not the combat. Cause it was lame. Truly the best combat system I ever played was RAGE, and while this doesn't come close, I'm seeing some new depth tha I didn't see before, such as Sentintel (mentioned above) and Ranged).

In one go. sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]\n\nSo let me get this straight:\n\n* I may declare one \"attack\" -- not character, but one total attack -- against each enemy with which I am engaged. There is no restriction with how many times one character can attack the same opponent, but (ah, but) I only get one \"declaration\" per Round. So if I declare all three of my Ready characters, all three exhaust (Tap). So two can attack Hummerhorns, and one can attack Ungolianth Spawn (Frex).\n\n* Now its YOUR turn. You also have Ranged. You DECLARE an attack on Ungolianth Spawn. You burn an ability and untap Legolas. On YOUR declaration, I can now tap Legolas to add his attack to the total value.

It's your game, so do what creates the most enjoyable experience for you and your play group. Until the mythical tournament format actually materializes (or if you are competing in one of the many fantastic community competitions), you can play with 50 Gandalfs (Gandalves?) if that's fun for you. However, if you think \"nothing good\" ever comes off the encounter deck, I'd direct your attention towards Grimbeorn, Ranger of Ithilien, and Durin's Helm from the upcoming AP (Foundations of Stone?). Driven by Shadow is clearly not one such card, but don't be so quick to assume that the encounter deck won't throw you a bone once in a while. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62203-combat-clarity-ranged-melee-tapping-untapping/?do=findComment&comment=610495","commentId":610495,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1332809124,"content":"Thia Halmades said:\n\n \n\nI still contend that in a deck where nothing good ever happens and it has the barking Eye of Sauron on the back, a card that removes Attachments is meant to remove player supporing attachments, not Caught in a Web.\n\n \n\n \n\nthis is absolutely what it means.. there is no doubt in my mind..

If you can run a risk/reward gambit and have Gimli with a Dwarven Axe, having taken damage, etc., and find a way to untap him and declare a new attack, that's not just legal, that's kind of the point. I'm still fiddling with my first tactics deck before I throw it at the milk-run scenario to see what happens. But when you look at Elladan and Boromir, that's what they do. Declare, tap, resolve.

This doesn't even include other ranged buffs though marks or just the assorted allies, for as if you would ever NOT run ranged allies if this is true. So basically we are talking about the trivialisation of the entire combat phase as you will nvr have a threat last more than one round, and often though smart engagement be able to kill most of them b4 they even get a chance to attack or receive shadow cards. On a side note you can add to that eagles/marks on frodo with the sentinel blocker and a bunch of hitches... and you can also block everything in the game with zero chance of death.\n\nThe ability to only attack a single target once was one of the real good limitations for the player to stop the board getting out of control. This game is infamous for becoming pretty easy once you have your cards on the table and most of the difficulty is during the start. If this double attack thing with ranged is true, it basically means that you achieve this over saturation of the board were the encounter deck becomes no threat at all much faster.\n\n7775589.png [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7775589/img/7775589.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62203-combat-clarity-ranged-melee-tapping-untapping/?do=findComment&comment=611572","commentId":611572,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1333041367,"content":" Yeah, but still...for this we needed first to have Dunedain Cache on the table, and then enough untap effects to ready Gimli four times !

I wouldn't go as far as saying it trivializes the combat phase. We had to talk and coordinate ourselves to make it happen. We used teamwork, and that's what the game is about. I wouldn't call animated discussions and intensive card combos trivial : it was a lot of fun.\n\nAnd well, as it was said, it is perfectly legal for a single hero to attack multiple times as long as you only declare one attack per monster as a player. Take Boromir for instance : it makes his ability thematically awesome : you attack on all sides, lash out at your foes, but at the cost of threat.\n\nBottom line, with the exception of that specific game when we played  Conflict at the Carrock, I never saw this rule break the game.

The trouble I have with the current ruling is that it's making a distinction between declaring an attack and participating in an attack when this isn't addressed in the combat steps. A single player declares multiple attackers, not one attacker and a couple participants. So why, then, does a ranged character get the option to be a participant? Why isn't the character declared as an attacker as well? It seems strange to me that there is a distinction between attackers and participants in this particular instance when similar situations don't, i.e. there is no difference between who engages whom. That seems utterly inconsistent to me. If Player 2's Brand shot Player 1's Hill Troll during Player 1's turn, Player 2 should not be able to attack the Hill Troll at all during his turn.
