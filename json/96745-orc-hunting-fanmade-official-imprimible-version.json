I worked and tested it about lots of days (you can see the beta version posted here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/94572-orc-hunting-fanmade/] days ago).\n\n \n\nFinally the work is finished, last update is definitive, tested alone and with 4 players, several times...\n\n \n\nThere is also avalaible in octgn, or you can print (for example, by printerstudio)... 100 cards! Wow, more than 80mb the file, lol... hard job --> this is the link: Orc Hunting Printerstudio [http://www.mediafire.com/download/2dcs5e1c3de63j1/Orc%20Hunting%20-%20printerstudio.zip]. All cards and files ready to be printed (the templates have been got from GeckoTH [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/GeckoTH]-thanks Geck!-).\n\n \n\nThen, a few spoilers you can find in the zip file:\n\n \n\n \n\n8dk4.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/13/8dk4.jpg]  \n\n \n\n6b1c.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/829/6b1c.jpg]  \n\n \n\n4frs.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/194/4frs.jpg]  \n\n \n\n0zc7.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/22/0zc7.jpg]  \n\n \n\nsfgr.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/812/sfgr.jpg]  \n\n \n\n39la.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/268/39la.jpg]  \n\n \n\nqms6.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/28/qms6.jpg]  \n\n \n\n674t.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/849/674t.jpg]  \n\n \n\nuvsi.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/809/uvsi.jpg]  \n\n \n\nvhx0.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/855/vhx0.jpg]\n\n \n\nThe game is really really funny. You suffer until the last round of the game. Sure.\n\nMaybe because you can't play allies, or better: allies must be discarded at the end of the round. So you never can get any powered-deck in any moment. (ah: outlarnders and megadwarfs are useless here :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].\n\nThe idea is that the heroes are alone and they must be strong and survive with their own habilities. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nCould you win the game? Could your heroes win fame? Tactic Boromir of course, but..., could you play other heroes and display their power? .... :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nIt is not impossible, but maybe you must make any change in your deck (for example, include ready habilities...)\n\n \n\nIn fact, lots of cards that have forest thematic are good here (for example, dunedain leadership attahcments..., noldor twins heroes...), and useless cards, here are important (Common Cause [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/common-cause-core], Cloak [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/over-hill-and-under-hill/spare-hood-and-cloak-ohauh], Favour of the Lady [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/the-favor-of-the-lady-core], Rear Guard [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/the-hills-of-emyn-muil/rear-guard-thoem]...even Short Cut [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/the-watcher-in-the-water/short-cut-twitw]!!!)\n\nEdited January 12, 2014 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96745-orc-hunting-fanmade-official-imprimible-version/?do=findComment&comment=952856","commentId":952856,"userName":"soldat7","timestamp":1389585063,"content":"Great job matching art to the cards.
