I had quested successfully and I was going to make a burgle attempt. After shufflling my deck I noticed that I still had Imladris Stargazer ready. Can I use her to re-organise the top 5 cards of my deck to ensure that I can make a successful burgle attempt?\n\n \n\nThe question I was debating is: Are there any player action steps when making a burgle attempt?\n\nIf yes, then I can use her. If there are no player actions then I guess you can't. Some advise on this would be appreciated.\n\n \n\nAs it happens I played it without using her and we as a group (3 players) just about beat the quest. Close run thing though!!\n\n \n\nThanks, All."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93506-burgle-attempts-stargazer-allowed/?do=findComment&comment=908644","commentId":908644,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1384421430,"content":"It's in the official faq :\n\nQ: While making a Burgle attempt in The Lonely Mountain scenario, when can players take actions?\nA: Players can take actions after step 2, before step 3.\n\n \n\nFor reminder, step 2 is when you shuffle and discard your deck. So it's not possible."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93506-burgle-attempts-stargazer-allowed/?do=findComment&comment=908866","commentId":908866,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1384447722,"content":"The burgle rules are a little funky.  It's not the \"top\" card of your deck that has to be matched, it's the \"revealed\" card.  I asked a question about this awhile back and posted the official response in this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/87288-burgling-card-draw-deck-manipulation/?hl=burgle].  \n\n \n\nOnce the top card is revealed, you could use the Stargazer to bury it 5 cards deep in your deck and it doesn't matter -- you still have to match that card.  On the other hand, you could use Beravor to draw it immediately and provide at least one guaranteed match for that card.   Card draw effects like King Under the Mountain are very much your friend in this scenario."}]}
