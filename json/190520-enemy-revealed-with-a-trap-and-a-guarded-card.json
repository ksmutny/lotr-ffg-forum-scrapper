I then draw a guarded objective location and then, because of the Guarded effect, I draw a enemy. Since the trap has no Forced effect, I attached the enemy to the objective location, because I thought the the Guarded effect doesn't make the enemy eligible for the trap.\n\n \n\nWas I playing it right?\n\n \n\nThanks!\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190520-enemy-revealed-with-a-trap-and-a-guarded-card/?do=findComment&comment=1835688","commentId":1835688,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1444092825,"content":"I see no reason why being a guard would make an enemy ineligible for traps. The enemy still entered the staging area and thus triggered the Spikes. You should've attached the Ranger Spikes and the location to the enemy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190520-enemy-revealed-with-a-trap-and-a-guarded-card/?do=findComment&comment=1835743","commentId":1835743,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1444094849,"content":"That's what I was about to do, actually, attach the enemy to the trap with the guarded location!\n\n \n\nThanks!"}]}
