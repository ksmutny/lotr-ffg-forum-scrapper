The word 'to' is very significant here. Where an effect says \"Do X *to* Y,\" if you cannot do Y, so also cannot do X. There is precedent in the ruling on Flame of Anor that it cannot target an Istari character who is ready because of the phrasing with the word 'to'. So applying this principle, Athelas cannot be targeted on a character which cannot be healed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265033-athelas-taking-on-water/?do=findComment&comment=3117582","commentId":3117582,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1512833459,"content":"Athelas is clearly targeting the ship objective (\"attachment from that character\"), which is illegal since the ships are immune to player card effects.\n\nThis is in addition to PocketWraith's correct point about cost and effect. Though I would add that it can still be used on a regular character that has no damage on it because \"all\" can include 0. The important part here is that the ships are immune to player card effects and cannot be healed at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265033-athelas-taking-on-water/?do=findComment&comment=3118164","commentId":3118164,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1512866682,"content":"It would be nice to see an ally that could repair ship allies..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265033-athelas-taking-on-water/?do=findComment&comment=3121661","commentId":3121661,"userName":"JJ48","timestamp":1513060934,"content":"> On 12/9/2017 at 7:44 PM, Lecitadin said:\n> \n> It would be nice to see an ally that could repair ship allies...\n\nSounds like a job for an ally version of Cirdan!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265033-athelas-taking-on-water/?do=findComment&comment=3122425","commentId":3122425,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1513101645,"content":"> 11 hours ago, JJ48 said:\n> \n> Sounds like a job for an ally version of Cirdan!\n\nYou're wright about that!"}]}
