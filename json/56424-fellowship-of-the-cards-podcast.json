They are trying to do something a bit different with this one focusing on the lore of the game, but they still go though a lot of techy stuff.\n\nI find the guys on this show to be that great mix of passionate, knowledgeable and humble. What I mean by humble is that you will not hear blanket statments on how crap a card is and how you are a moron if you run it when it is in fact one of the best cards in the sphere like you have heard at least 3 times in CoTR, causing retractions in next episode :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] The guys at FsotC seam to be more relaxed and chatty, focusing on Lore and sound like they are exploring the game themselves with us, rather than trying to project an air of being exerts and \"telling\" us what is up. It is subtle, but I think it gives the entire show a very different vibe. A good vibe.\n\nIf that isn't enough to get you listening, they are also running a competition for a free copy of Kaz... all you have to do is like their Facebook or chat in there comments page on their site - thefellowshipofthecards.com/ [http://thefellowshipofthecards.com/]\n \n\nAnyway, I also give this show the stamp of awesomeness!!

That's the best part ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] \"Steward of Gondor is crazy good--no, wait, it's terrible--er, it's ridiculously powerful!\" Honestly, though, they're both great podcasts that occupy decidedly different niches. As a player who enjoys both thematic gameplay and the art of efficient deck-building, I find each cast brings something worthwhile to the table."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56424-fellowship-of-the-cards-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=557461","commentId":557461,"userName":"TheRomance","timestamp":1321627025,"content":" I've listened to the first three, and I plan on listening to the newer ones when I find the time =P.  But yeah, it is a wonderful podcast, and it truly seems like the guys are having a good time with the cards and the game.  Keep up the great work guys, we listeners love it corazon.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/corazon.gif]."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56424-fellowship-of-the-cards-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=557590","commentId":557590,"userName":"gamestar10","timestamp":1321653254,"content":"Wow.
