The old ones were limited by 1 per deck, which is very simple to play and handle.\nBut the new once have a limitation about 1 copy in the victory display. So i think i can include 3 copies of them into my deck and can play 2 or more of them at the same time (they are not unique), but can i make one of them to the current quest if a copy of this side quest is currently in the victory display?\n\nWere does an explored side quest go if there is a copy of it currently in the victory display?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241150-sidequests-limit-1-copy-in-the-victory-display/?do=findComment&comment=2613276","commentId":2613276,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1485588518,"content":"It goes in the owner's discard pile (there is a paragraph on that in the Sands of Harad rule book).  I see no reason why you couldn't play multiple copies of the same quest into the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241150-sidequests-limit-1-copy-in-the-victory-display/?do=findComment&comment=2614102","commentId":2614102,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1485651010,"content":"Rules aside, is there a particular reason why you want to do this?

The new Thurindir-Hero get's +1 WIL for each Side Quest in the victory display.  I only want to check how max +WIL i could give him in Solo and MP.\n\n \n\n> On 28.1.2017 at 8:28 AM, GrandSpleen said:\n> \n> It goes in the owner's discard pile (there is a paragraph on that in the Sands of Harad rule book).  I see no reason why you couldn't play multiple copies of the same quest into the staging area.\n\nAh .. thanks .. i do not own the SoH-Box, so i don't know the rule. That helps."}]}
