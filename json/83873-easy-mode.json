We were actually very confused with the new nightmare option, because we already felt the games biggest weakness is it's difficulty.\n\nI can only tell you from my point of view: When the game was new my whole gaming group played it. By now everyone (but me) has given up on the game, because it was just to difficult to be fun. They all got frustrated with one scenario or another (or several in a row) and dropped out at some point. They had realised that you need to put a lot of efford in research and deckbuilding (and card buying) to have a chance with the new scenarios. Most of my friends are casual gamers and don't visit any forums (and therefore their voices will never be heared). I cannot blame them and I too was very close to throwing my cards a couple of times.\n\nIn general I never play anything in the \"easy mode\", but here I will (propably often). Actually the introduction of easy mode is not enough in my opinion, because it gives people the feeling they are cheating, or that they are infirior players. I think they should have just made standard easier and sell \"hard mode\" to the players that want an additional challenge.

There is a physiological effect going on here that the developers didn't take into account. People feel that they are not \"really\" playing it.. like they are cheating as some have said or that they finish the quest and have no sense of accomplishment. This is a common problem in game design. If you put in levels of difficulty, instantly there is a sigma on the easier modes.\n \nThat being said, there is defiantly a group of people that need this mode, and I am not talking about people that suck at the game. Many players of this game are not card game players, as this is really a board game that uses cards and many players came from board game community NOT the card game community.

Playtest with an average player with an average deck and you will be shocked by the results, I am sure of it! On the long run this game will not survive without the average people.

You're right that it's not an \"amazing innovation,\" but it is important. Prior to this announcment, altering the encounter deck of one's own accord resided in the same psychologically uncomfortable zone as the classic \"let's just ignore that encounter card and reveal another one\" play. It was formally cheating. Some players were certainly fine with that, but I know many others didn't want to \"cheat\" in order to enjoy the game. \n\nNow that Easy Mode exists, that self-imposed stigma no longer needs to apply. Players can adjust the difficulty to suit their tastes without feeling as if they are circumventing the official rules. Additionally, the Easy Mode document provides a level of standardization that was previously absent. All of this results in a less challenging game experience but one that retains an important degree of legitimacy. It's one thing to make up your own rules; it's another thing entirely for the publisher to say, \"Here's another way to play our game. You can play this way and it's totally fine. You aren't cheating.\" That means a lot to many players.\n\nI say this as a very experienced LotR player who will probably never use the Easy Mode variant: it is a fantastic and necessary addition to the game. It will only help bring jilted players back into the fold by providing them with a new way to play--and, hopefully, succeed--without feeling as though they are breaking the rules. The official blessing from FFG is significant in and of itself.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=796824","commentId":796824,"userName":"Hannibal_pjv","timestamp":1368959050,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nYesterday me and my friend play 2 games. first game Dol-Guldor nightmare we lost.

This game can become really borong if it is too easy. You like to play nightmare version and it suit nicely to you. I normally play normal version and I am guite happy with them. I know that I could have even better succes with a little bit more Boromir like deck building, but there is a little pard of Pippin and Bilbo player in me, so normal difficulty seems to be the best for me. And now easy mode make the life of any casual and Pippin / Bilbo players much easier. Like someone above said the extra resource in the beginning is very powerfull ability. It does not brake the game and the story reamains relatively same. If it feels too easy, maybe take only that starting resource and give it a try. In anyway I am guite happy to see an \"official\" solution to different difficulties (levels) to this game. It is a guite common way of solwing problems in coop games. Pandemia has diffuculty levels, Sinking Island have them, The Nazgul board game has them. Nice to see them in this game too!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=796905","commentId":796905,"userName":"Goldenrod","timestamp":1368974916,"content":"Started playing this game a month 1/2 ago.

With those out of the way, I'm excited to see how the quests turn out. Will they become more fun, or more boring?\n\n\n\nExactly! I actually didn't mind the difficulty of scenarios per se, but rather how they achieve to amp up the difficulty. Basically adding cards saying 'You are f***ed. You lose the game.' simply isn't fun.\n\nWith easy mode this part of the problem is addressed. But I cannot shake the feeling it's 'too little, too late'. Everyone I know who had been playing the game has already stopped and sold their collection. The vocal-minority Glaurung faction has already taken over.\n\nMyself, I was tempted to stop buying more cards after 'The Shadow & Flame' but was able to win after building two decks specifically to beat it. But I'm simply not interested in building decks specifically suited for a single scenario.

With those out of the way, I'm excited to see how the quests turn out. Will they become more fun, or more boring?\n\n \n\nExactly! I actually didn't mind the difficulty of scenarios per se, but rather how they achieve to amp up the difficulty. Basically adding cards saying 'You are f***ed. You lose the game.' simply isn't fun.\n\n \n\nWith easy mode this part of the problem is addressed. But I cannot shake the feeling it's 'too little, too late'. Everyone I know who had been playing the game has already stopped and sold their collection. The vocal-minority Glaurung faction has already taken over.\n\nMyself, I was tempted to stop buying more cards after 'The Shadow & Flame' but was able to win after building two decks specifically to beat it.

I really like how this game can expand, yet still allow for deckbuilding, and the easy mode makes some more Pippin-like decks succeed for the harder scenarios. I also really don't like making a deck just to beat a scenario, because I really like to build a deck based on theme and synergy, not playing the metagame. \n\nI still have faith in this format, but you are of course right in your opnion!

The game isn't \"hard\".. but it relies on random game over card effects. Effects that have nothing to do with skill or deck building… it is just the luck of the draw. I have only recently come back as the nightmare packs really interest me… but I stopped playing because I found it frustrating that my time and effort in deck building was meaningless. .. well in some cases. So for me it is not about difficultly.. as the game isn't \"difficult\" it is just that at any turn you can die instantly.\n\nThere is just NO way that a analogue AI like a dummy draw deck can deal with a human deck builder.. there is just no way.. (though Kingdom Death's AI cards are giving it a real try!) So once the pool gets larger and people start making powerful decks and get used to the quest, there is really NO WAY you can loose. The only way around this is to put in a mechanism called \"setback\".. it is used in many games that require dummy decks. Random draws that are pure luck and can greatly effect the player position. Sure there are cards that can help if you have them in hand, but even that was not enough and now there are many cards with effects that can not be canceled, you draw it you die. Put simply it is a bad game design period.\n\nNow the game is a fun game, and some people do not mind the randomness off it. I enjoy it a lot, and play it now and then but I like to feel that I can make strategic decisions about my deck and the way I play it.. in this game it is simply not like that. You make a good deck and it snowballs into unstoppable power, or you hit the setbacks and limp over the line or more recently loose. There is no deck, or skill that can get past this… this game is more like Black Jack than a CCG.\n\nCan it be fun? Sure.. winning is not the point of a game, as Glaurung's Dol Gol Dur story shows, it can still be fun, a lot of fun. I have fun playing it. This fact though dose not remove the point that there is a fundamentally bad game design at the very core of this game that will always cause threads about difficulty, house rule fixes, rage threads.. etc etc. It has been like that form day 1.. and it will never change.. and you know why?

That is, I basically created four mono-sphere decks by including a copy of (almost) every card for a sphere, doubling some of the allies cards until I had about 30 allies in the deck. I then picked three heroes for each deck and tried to beat a scenario with different combinations of decks. Sometimes I won 5 of 6 games, sometimes only 1 in 6. But I always felt that I had a chance - even in the Battle of Lake Town POD scenario.\n\nThis first changed with 'Shadow and Flame'. It was the first scenario I built decks specifically to beat it. And this was also when I first thought of stopping to invest in the game.\n\nNow, enter the Numenor set. I still managed to beat the first scenario using the (slightly modified) decks I had used to beat 'Shadow and Flame', but in the Ithilien scenario I didn't even make any kind of progress in the first stage. And worse, I didn't really have any good idea how to change the decks to beat it.\n\nAs far as I know, the Numenor set wasn't advertised as 'only Pro's need apply'. There was no way for me to tell in advance it would be so friggin hard. Even the difficulty ratings given offer no hint (difficulty 4 for Ithilien?! Who do they think they're kidding? I'd say it's about a nine).\n\nAnd to give an example what I hate about the scenario: Some of the worst effects in the story deck are 'Forced:' effects instead of 'When Revealed'. Likewise some locations are 'immune to player card effects'. Or a shadow card effect that 'cannnot be canceled'.\n\nSo basically, the designers are giving us cards to deal with effects and then design the story cards so that these cards are useless. Imho, this is a big no, no.\n\nNow, with Easy Mode I've finally beaten the Ithilien scenario in my third attempt and it was very, very close, even though I played it very, very safe. Basically, exactly how I like my difficulty. Some of the 'screw you' cards are still in the story deck, but there are fewer, so you can better plan for them.\n\nWe'll see how I fare in the third scenario. I'll first try in in standard mode, of course, but I'm not optimistic.\n\nWhat I've been wondering is this: Aren't the cards for an entire cycle designed at the same time? If so, I have a feeling, the player cards required to beat the scenarios of the cycle started with the Numenor box reliably will only be available after the cycle is complete. Thinking back to the Khazad-Dum cycle, wasn't it exactly like that? The until-recently-dominant dwarf decks grew in power with each new AP released. If so, maybe I should just shelf the Numenor box and wait until the cycle is complete and play them then with decks built around the new cards.\n\nTL;DR: What I'm looking for are scenarios that you have a chance to win with an all-purpose deck, even if it takes several (say up to six ^^) tries. Even better would be scenarios that can be beaten using different strategies (i.e. spheres). That's actually what I had been hoping for in the beginning: Scenarios that play differently depending on your choice of spheres.

I did not look for a game that revolves around finding the one deck that is the only way to win a scenario.\n\n \n\n \n\nYes, all of the cards for a cycle are designed and playtested at once.\n\nI've never had to really, specifically deck build for a quest, with the exception of adding healing to Rhosgobel. Shadow and Flame was simply \"chump block for the win.\" (meaning, never completely destroy a deck and only include cards I think would apply only to a given scenario - but i do add and take away lots of different things dependent on Battle/Siege/WP questing, etc.)\n\nHoN is certainly more difficult, but other than knowing I needed to Battle and Siege quest (and therefore include heroes and allies that are good at that) I didn't deck build for it specifically and was able to win all of the quests.\n\nAs for the Forced effects that cannot be cancelled, I think that's a good thing. If every effect was easily negated, the encounter deck has little to no chance against a human player. Some of the negative effects must be able to go off, I think. So, IMHO, it's a good thing to have cards immune to certain player effects. Now, if every encounter card was, that'd be a bit extreme - but it's usually only a handful and that's fine by me. You have to think outside the box for how you want to approach that particular adventure.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a card game. And every card game of this genre, dating back to Magic: The Gathering, requires deck building. Whether it's figuring out how to beat the stellar deck your buddy trounces you with or how to master the encounter deck, you have to be willing to put in the effort to tweak a deck to succeed. This is what card games are about, and have always been about (again, meaning the CCG/TCG/LCG variety - not things like Old Maid or Uno).\n\nI struggle to understand the resistance by some players of this game to building decks for what is essentially an entirely new game/situation presented to us with each Quest. This isn't a board game. It's not a video game. Card games are all about, and always have been about, adapting to different challenges as the card pool grows - whether it's a competitive or co-op game. The very name \"living\" tells you the game will grow and change, requiring players to do the same. It's simply not enough to slap the latest cards into a deck and expect that to be successful.\n\nTo echo what another poster said, it seems like there is a contingent that plays this game not because they enjoy the aspects inherent in any LCG/CCG but simply because they like the theme - and that will always, it seems to me, lead to frustration."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=798125","commentId":798125,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1369275141,"content":"Dain Ironfoot said:\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a card game.

You start the game with bonus resources like the official \"Easy Mode\" but also with two extra cards in the starting hand (now a total of 8 cards). I've been amazed at how powerful this simple change can be. Usually on the first turn I can get out some allies and attachments and I'm very well set up for whatever comes off the encounter deck. It's a little tougher than official easy mode but a little easier than normal mode. Here's how I see it now in my head:\n\nEasiest\n\n1. Easy\n\n2. Revised Easy (described above)\n\n3. Standard\n\n4. Nightmare\n\nHardest\n\nWith these options I can easily pick which difficulty I want to play and have a satisfying game. For the record, last night I got a friend of mine who's never played before and we played Seige of Cair Andros on easy mode. I had two decks built, one outlands (the deck my friend used) and the other gondor based. Although we still didn't win, the game never felt overwhelming and victory always felt possible. He had a great time and is eager to play again. Based on this experience, I think easy mode is a definite success.

This can not be modified with skill. It is pure luck. You can nto \"overcome\" it.. you just have to either weaken your deck to put a answer to it, and then happen to have it drawn when the card is drawn, or more often is the case, ignore it make your deck stronger (as in have a higher win ratio) and just hope it is not drawn.\n\n\n\nI agree unlucky draw will be crippling.\nTurn 1 Attercop or Mumakil or something like that will always make your game tougher and as result make your score worse.\nIf that's what people are saying, then I agree with them and I guess I misunderstood.\n\nBut I thought they were saying there are cards that will 'auto lose' the game for you if drawn and there was nothing you could do to stop it?\nSo far I have yet to encounter a card that was 'auto lose'.\n\nWhile there are some cases when encounter deck is stacked to a point where you will lose no matter what you do,\nbut more often then not had you done something differently 2~3 turns ago in anticipation of worst case scenario with each card flip, you would've been able to survive that encounter and therefore 'overcome' it. I have yet to see an encounter card that cannot be mitigated by clever plays (let alone deck build).\n\nThen again, this is what the easy mode is for; if you feel like some cards are unfair and is 'automatic lose', you can simply take them out now with official variant."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=798445","commentId":798445,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1369356430,"content":"booored said:\n\n \n\nKcall07 said:\n\n \n\nTo call the game flawed, luck based, and saying no skill is involved in playing it because of these two cards is ludicrous.\n\n \n\n \n\nThen you havn't understood what people are saying.

Shadow cards will add up to 3 additional damage to that (up to 4 in a four player game). There's also a shadow effect dealing 1 damage to the defender that cannot be soaked. In addition there's both an enemy that gets an extra attack from the staging area and a shadow effect granting an additional attack.\n\nEffectively this means you cannot ever dare to defend with a hero (except Frodo or - once - Beorn) or an ally with only 1 hit point. So you either must have two allies that can soak 2 damage in reserve or a cards that allow you to prevent an enemy from attacking.\n\nThe majority of cards in the deck are enemies and almost all of the Treachery cards have surge which usually means you need to have a second defender ready.\n\nAnd because the Path to Ithilien is the active location, all of these enemies will attack right away, unless you quest successfully and can accumulate at least four tokens. And this is frankly a gamble and will require luck.\n\nIf one of your heroes is killed in this initial assault you might as well start over. It may not be an instant game over, but you'll lose nonetheless. You can draw out the game but you will never win it.\n\nIn my nine games this only worked in two of the three easy-mode games and in none of the 'normal difficulty' ones.\n\nClawing your way back to win with a single hero can only work late in the game after you've already assembled a sizeable band of allies.\n\n \n\nAlright, and now I'm ready for the flood of replies telling me how I'm totally wrong, not skilled enough and have been using crap decks.

However I think it's best to see Into Ithillien as something of an anomaly. There was a long thread when it came out suggesting its difficulty was an oversight by the developers, and a correction has been made since to blocking wargs in the FAQ.\n\nThe quest before and after are far better balanced. Me and my play partner were quite surprised when we got to Cair Andros and beat it in a couple of tries (with our excruciatingly honed decks from Ithillien.) I have a feeling the variable difficulties in this cycle will be much more manageable. And from the looks of the previews we'll be getting some great new player cards which will make dispatching the Mumakil all the easier.\n\nThat is, until the nightmare version comes out. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=798480","commentId":798480,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1369372693,"content":"it is not an anomaly.. it is a clear progression."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=798927","commentId":798927,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1369486216,"content":"TragicTheBlathering said:\n\nit is not an anomaly.. it is a clear progression.\n\n\n\n \n\nI think it is an anomaly, it's definitely a lot harder than the designers thought.

I think they thought it was an easy scenario and that therefore HoN wasn't that bad (one easy, one medium, one hard) but actually Into Ithilian is so hard that Cair Andros ends up being the medium.\n\n \n\nWhich means that instead of getting a 4 and 6 and an 8 (the 6 and and 8 are from memory), we got a 6 an 8 and a 10.\n\n \n\nThis is an anomolgy because generaly speaking the \"easy\" quests (4's and the like) haven't been very challanging at all,but this time it clearly is. \n\nPersonally I think the difficulties concept should be scrapped though, they're not very accurate (although into Ithilien is clearly the least accurate)."}]}
