These are the only NM quests I am not interested in buying.\n\nCouldn't agree more but as a perfectionist and collector I'll have to buy them just so that I have them.... but will pretty much never play them. The first box was done so badly and the quests in the second box are crappy enough without nightmare, nightmare will only make them more frustrating. Also as much as I really hate the other 5 quests I LOVE the battle of five armies so am slightly keen to play the nm version. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129378-the-darkness-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=1371974","commentId":1371974,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1418965639,"content":"So true...

Removing them costs too much and is too difficult as well (should be able to do it whether troll camp is in staging or not, if you dont keep/save one in staging you're just screwed....)\n\nThe effect that only lets one character attack trolls at a time is just insanely stupid. \n\nif you have a high enough willpower deck and low enough threat you can just quest and turn them to stone and not actually face any trolls which although thematic means you dont actually have to bring decent combat cards/decks to the table. \n\nDon't even get me started on the nightmare version of this quest...... Mince them Fine is the stupidest encounter card ever made.\n\n \n\nForgot about Over the Misty Mountains, that quest actually isn't bad at all, neither is the nightmare version and I like defeating the Great Goblin. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129378-the-darkness-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=1371998","commentId":1371998,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1418970003,"content":"the phrase \"although thematic\" bothers me :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nedit: and anyway there was no battle in the books\n\nEdited December 19, 2014 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129378-the-darkness-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=1372016","commentId":1372016,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1418974783,"content":"> the phrase \"although thematic\" bothers me :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n> \n>  \n> \n> edit: and anyway there was no battle in the books\n\nyou got me there... it actual is quite bothering haha :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129378-the-darkness-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=1372217","commentId":1372217,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1418999499,"content":"Hmmm I will buy this cards anyway….
