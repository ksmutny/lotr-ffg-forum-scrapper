But what if you lose that scenario and decide to revert back to the hero you swapped out?\n\n \n\nIn most cases in campaign mode if you replay the scenario any changes to your campaign log are reversed, e.g. fallen heroes, boons/burdens acquired. Is it the same in this case, and the +1 threat penalty would go away? Or would it instead become a +2 threat penalty for two hero switches, even though you haven't advanced because the switch took place between, and not during, the scenario you are replaying? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134618-switching-heroes-in-campaign-mode/?do=findComment&comment=1444340","commentId":1444340,"userName":"chadgar24","timestamp":1423630128,"content":"If you do a do-over any effects that happened from your failed quest have no effect on the do over.
