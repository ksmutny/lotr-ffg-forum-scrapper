So if you exhaust to Goblin-Cleaver, you couldn't exhaust it to use on Foe-Hammer ir you kill the enemy.\n\n \n\nDespite all of this, i believe you \"still get it's benefit when I have the character wielding it attack\".\n\n \n\nI do not see anything in the rules that limits the effect of weapon attachments just by the fact that they are exhausted.
