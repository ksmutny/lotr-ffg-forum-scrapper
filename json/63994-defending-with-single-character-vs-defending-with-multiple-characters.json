Admittedly, Stand Together is a bit of a corner case, but Sudden Pitfall notably does NOT instruct a player to \"discard ALL defending characters.\" As such, literal interpretation would support the idea of a single discard."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63994-defending-with-single-character-vs-defending-with-multiple-characters/?do=findComment&comment=625814","commentId":625814,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1336096186,"content":"Then again, the norm is to only have a single defending character, would be a bit odd if they took Stand Together (as the lone card expection to this) into consideration in the wording of Sudden Pitfall. Had they worded it \"discard defending characters from play\", people would've been like A) what, all defenders everywhere or B) how can you have multiple defenders. SP is already quite a \"screw you\" card, wouldn't surprise me if you had to toss all the defenders."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63994-defending-with-single-character-vs-defending-with-multiple-characters/?do=findComment&comment=625894","commentId":625894,"userName":"CreepyBastard","timestamp":1336117022,"content":"That makes sense.
