I think the songs make more cards playable in conjunction with eachother, however some of the mental challenges of finding those combos/techs get taken away by having some cards so easily accessible. But now that you know how easy it is to make cards work with the songs you can make more advanced combos. In a way it is even more of a mental challenge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50937-song-of-kings/?do=findComment&comment=518029","commentId":518029,"userName":"Iver2","timestamp":1313989676,"content":"guys, I agree that they are quite overpowered.
