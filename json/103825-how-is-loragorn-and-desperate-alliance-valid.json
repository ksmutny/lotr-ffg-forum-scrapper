There is only one Aragorn in play, no matter who controls it, and his ability can only be triggered once per game.\n\nAs for the Doomed decks, I am hugely surprised how little they seem to work, solo or coop. I thought the cards like Legacy of Númenor will be a smash hit but I have, so far, found them not that effective, especially against the VoI (or AtS). Deep Knowledge should be a no brainer, still, but card draw has been given some difficulties lately. And as for Strider, it is all nice when he can push the threat down but that does not help until he does, and you might be facing all the enemies in the meantime, together with other difficulties.

I've played a few multiplayer games lately where the other player drew their entire deck. It totally ruined the game for me. I know that the new AP cycle has hand size hate, but that's just a Dunland gimmick and they can't do that every cycle going forward. With so much card draw and so many ways to recycle events, a hand limit is necessary to create tension.

But in that case we are talking about multiple copies of a card.  They could simply add to their explanation that \"limit once per game\" means total of once per player regardless of # of copies, and additionally that a single card with such a limit can only be trigger once (by any player).  Only problem there is that, in a fancy-schmancy situation, you could indeed have to keep track of which copy of Landroval you used the ability on, should another player gain control of one of your copies of Landroval through a card effect.  Sorry if I am not clear, just thinking as I type here.  \n\nEdited April 16, 2014 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103825-how-is-loragorn-and-desperate-alliance-valid/?do=findComment&comment=1051083","commentId":1051083,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1397624253,"content":"Yes, as GrandSpleen points out, per-player limits have been in place since Landroval was released. Because Stand and Fight allows another player to bring Landroval back into play, it is possible for multiple players to trigger Landroval's hero-saving effect. I don't have a problem with per player limits. It is not a trivial cost to paying 5 resources to return Landroval from a discard pile then wait for the right moment to trigger his response.\n\n \n\nMy issue is with specifically with Desperate Alliance and Loragorn. This combo involves only a single card (Aragorn starts in play) and has 0 cost and no setup dependencies. This is too powerful of an effect for too low of a cost. This is all the more true now that Doomed player cards have truly commoditized threat. Tactics Boromir did this, to an extent, but Deep Knowledge and Legacy of Númenor have opened the flood gates. As was mentioned above, threat is a fundamental part of the game. Being able to circumvent this limit for multiple players, using a single card, is simply too powerful. I understand the \"if you don't like it, don't play it\" argument. The fact is, most players play strictly by the rules, so errata does matter.\n\n \n\nPersonally, I hope that Lore Aragorn gets errata so that his ability can only be triggered by his owner (not his controller). Resetting your threat is balanced (but very powerful) if this costs you a choice of starting hero. With Desperate Alliance, a threat reset violates the balance of the game because it benefits a player who didn't even start with Aragorn.\n\nEdited April 16, 2014 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103825-how-is-loragorn-and-desperate-alliance-valid/?do=findComment&comment=1051435","commentId":1051435,"userName":"7theye","timestamp":1397657540,"content":"thank you everyone - Caleb please listen - change this ruling! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103825-how-is-loragorn-and-desperate-alliance-valid/?do=findComment&comment=1051516","commentId":1051516,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1397661456,"content":"I've always wondered about how you define \"starting threat\" in the situation where you have an extra hero.  Seems like Caleb and co. could say that Aragorn's 12 threat is included when you reset to your starting threat.  So a 30 threat deck would only be able to reset to 42 if you use this combo.  It twists the definition of \"starting\" a little bit, but at least you don't have to flip-flop or make exceptions to the per player, per game ruling."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103825-how-is-loragorn-and-desperate-alliance-valid/?do=findComment&comment=1051610","commentId":1051610,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1397665557,"content":"Your starting threat is your starting threat, not the starting threat you would have if you had loragorn...\n\nWell, maybe Caleb though it was working that way so he though it was not over broken...\n\n \n\nInteristing question when you control mirlonde, if someone make an official question, please include this in your question."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103825-how-is-loragorn-and-desperate-alliance-valid/?do=findComment&comment=1051672","commentId":1051672,"userName":"entMoot","timestamp":1397667347,"content":"Starting threat is a fixed number from set-up, so I don't think there should be room for Desperate Alliance to change that without changing the core rules:\n\n \n\nPage 10 of the rulebook:\n\n\"2.

Aragorn has an ability that should be once per game. And we know caleb has gone back on his work more times then Gollum. Do you remember the whole locations immune to player card effects fiasco?or in blood of gondor where it seems that you should have a choice as to what to do with turning over hidden cards or taking a new one, but he says you do?\n> \n> I just don't see how this makes any sense and others seem to agree. It should be changed to once per game. Just waiting for them to smarten up again and do it.\n\n \n\nThe ruling comes from Landraval which was FAQ'd to be once per game per player. As a result once per game now means (once per game per player) as this is an FAQ on what the wording means (and not an Errata on Landraval).\n\nTo get the solution you want (if you feel this is a broken combo) You should suggest to Caleb or another developer that once per game should be once per game (irrespective of players) and ask for Landraval to be errated to once per game per player.\n\nThis 'would' be valuable to clear up as it would enable them to make cards in future which are either once per game (truly amazing effects) and once per game per player (effects that are amazing but need to scale with players to effect the game equally viably in bigger and smaller games).\n\nOn the other hand practically every effect they would want to make would be once per game per player really - since most cards need to scale with more players. So it may be better to just Errata Lore Aragorn perhaps too: One use per game, once this effect is used treat this text as blank. Or something like that.\n\n \n\nEdit: For the record I completely see the importance of having it addressed in an FAQ or rules and understand why you don't want to accept \"just don't use it if you don't like it\". However It has in fact been addressed in the FAQ (under Landraval and by Caleb directly) - it's just you don't like the decision. \n\nEdited April 19, 2014 by Rapier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103825-how-is-loragorn-and-desperate-alliance-valid/?do=findComment&comment=1056089","commentId":1056089,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1398048591,"content":">  \n> \n> > I also don't think it that much of a problem.\n> > \n> > 1st, you need to draw the copies of DA to pass him around.\n> > \n> > That will not work out for all players who need a copy many a game.\n> > \n> > We tried, and stopped after 2 games.\n> > \n> > 2nd, if you draw a copy in your opening hand, it will be a dead card for a long time.\n> > \n> > It does take up deck slots like that.\n> > \n> > And the most simple reason why it not a problem at all imo: if you don't like it, don't use it.\n> \n> For the 1000000th time I CANT CONTROL\n> \n> WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO!!!!!\n> \n> Stop saying don't use it if I don't like it.

You could (for instance) have a mechanic to represent a single unique use of an item that you otherwise want to have another game effect.\n\n \n\nFor example the horn of gondor in the saga quest - you could have it give a bonus like (+1 willpower) all the time and once per game blow the horn to have all enemies engage with you.\n\nNow if the horn was played on the ring-bearer (which would be an odd choice thematically) it could arguably be triggered again by another player under the current rules. However the horn being one use (because the result of it's use was death) seems like something we would want to make exactly one use.\n\n \n\nI know we could design around it in other ways (for instance having the horn be discarded) but the fact that the horn is passed on seems thematically relevant to me - You could even design items which have a goond one use and then an ongoing passive effect. \n\n \n\nFor example: Horn of Gondor: \"Gondor, attach to a hero\" Action: once per game engage all enemies in play, dealing one damage to each enemy engaged in this way. Discard the hero this is attactched to from play. Attach the horn to another hero for the rest of the game the horn of gondor grants +1 willpower\"\n\nNow this is definitely interesting and the concept opens up a new line of attachments - however being able to transfer the horn between players and keep reusing the main effect would spoil the whole design in multiplayer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103825-how-is-loragorn-and-desperate-alliance-valid/?do=findComment&comment=1069877","commentId":1069877,"userName":"Mich the One","timestamp":1399027844,"content":"I admit the ruling stating that \"once per game\" really means \"once per game per player\" seems weird. But hey, there has been so many suprising rule judgments that this now seems passable. And once I accept it then I do not personally have any mental or moral problems with passing around Loragorn to trigger his exceptional threat lowering ability with each player.\n\n \n\nThe argument that this combo takes care of one of the key aspects of the game (threat management) does not persuade me at all. Because, yes, it does take care of it (to extent), But then you could well say e.g. that defending, which is another key game aspect, is perfectly taken care by Beregond + Gondorian Shield or by Beorn backed up with Landroval or that 5 cost spirit card that resurrects heores. Should we frown upon that?\n\n \n\nSo yes, indeed with Loragorn/Alliance we do not have to worry that much about threat, but first you need to invest in it properly: \n\n- it takes a hero spot,\n\n- you need to play a lore/spirit deck (Lorgaorn being lore and Alliance being spirit; and the alliance trick can be trigerred only by the one who controls given hero, so another player cannot play alliance on your Loragorn),\n\n- you are likely to put three copies of DA in your deck (or commit to other card investment, such as three Words of Command plus Istaris, etc.)\n\n \n\nI am just saying that in my book it is a fair trade-off.

On the other hand if you dedicate more deck space in each players deck then it suddenly takes up a whole lot of slots for other cards.\n\nAll in all this does not feel like a very elegant solution to me."}]}
