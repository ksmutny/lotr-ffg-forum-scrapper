Crucially, these are two different steps in the process, which saves your character in this case.\n\nBecause on page 31, resolving attacks is in a green box, meaning \"any player can take actions...between the game steps stated in the rules\". This provides the window you need: between applying the shadow effect and determining combat damage, you can take actions. This would include the play of events (whose actions are not limited to other phases of the round) and use of Glorfindel's ability (assuming you have not already used that this round).\n\n \n\n \n\n "}]}
