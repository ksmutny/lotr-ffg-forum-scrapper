The card text (in these sorts of games) tends to be quite explicit. That is, \"it says what it means and it means what it says\".\n\nBut don't take that as sarcasm DrNate. I don't mean it as such. Take for granted that I do not have my copy of the game yet, but I have read the rules fairly thoroughly. My understanding is that you don't have to engage a location. That adds quite a bit of threat... but.. in this case what if you were close to finishing off the quest entirely. You draw a location, but you also have an enemy you can take out. It might make more sense to take out the enemy and score the two quest tokens (and therefore finishing the quest!), rather than fooling with the location at all.\n\nAnd that might be the relative strength and value of Legolas; the ability to still gain quest tokens on the main quest even though you're otherwise blocked by locations.\n\nOf course, I may be wrong.
