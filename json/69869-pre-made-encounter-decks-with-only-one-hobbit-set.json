Pinch, Nab! - All 3 in \"Over the Misty Mountains Grim (part 2)\" - I put them here because that phrase happens before the defeat of the Great Goblin.\n\nAll the other cards - 2 of each in \"Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim,\" and 1 of each in \"Over the Misty Mountains Grim (part 2)\" - I split them up this way to keep the deck sizes in proportion to the length of the scenarios.\n\n \n\nDoes anyone else like to keep their encounter decks pre-made?  Do you think these mixes might work?  I know they are different from the suggested mixes, but I think they will play OK.  Am I missing something?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69869-pre-made-encounter-decks-with-only-one-hobbit-set/?do=findComment&comment=682262","commentId":682262,"userName":"Emrad","timestamp":1345961959,"content":"Well,

could have been sent to hunt for him\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69869-pre-made-encounter-decks-with-only-one-hobbit-set/?do=findComment&comment=682618","commentId":682618,"userName":"Shockeffect","timestamp":1346006745,"content":"Cunir
