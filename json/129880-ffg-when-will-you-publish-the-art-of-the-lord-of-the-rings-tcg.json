This said, I'm not so sure that if you have the rights to publish a game, then you have also the rights to publish artbooks, so, it could be more difficult than we expect.\n\n \n\nBut anyway, if there's a LotR or an Android artbook, I'll get them for sure :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129880-ffg-when-will-you-publish-the-art-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-tcg/?do=findComment&comment=1386973","commentId":1386973,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1419994160,"content":"Yeah but only people that play this game would even know about it and this game is but a fraction of the popularity.\n\n@other most artists have decent sized copies if you look."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129880-ffg-when-will-you-publish-the-art-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-tcg/?do=findComment&comment=1635982","commentId":1635982,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1432643683,"content":"Bumping this thread after randomly looking through a whole bunch of locations in the game and their fantastic art. Parth Galen, The Seat of Seeing, Rauros Falls, Doors of Durin, there are so so many amazing places in middle earth that are depicted in this game with astounding art. Honestly I would buy an art book simply filled with the location art without enemies or treacheries or anything else let alone one that includes everything. As much as there might not be that much demand for an art book I know that all the truly dedicated or obsessed players of this game would HAVE to own a copy if it existed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129880-ffg-when-will-you-publish-the-art-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-tcg/?do=findComment&comment=1636346","commentId":1636346,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1432658036,"content":"Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. I do like most of the art in the game, but there are sometimes that it just doesn't do it for me. It kind of a hit and miss.
