This means that player card effects cannot directly influence or interact with a card that is immune to player card effects. Examples include dealing damage to an enemy, placing progress on a location, altering a card’s text or statistics, moving a card, engaging an enemy, traveling to a location, or discarding a card.\n\nEdited March 4, 2015 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135562-beorn-stand-together/?do=findComment&comment=1476197","commentId":1476197,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1425506333,"content":"It depends on how you see Stand Together working.  \n\n \n\nThere was some ruling about Heavy Stroke a long time back-- Heavy Stroke says that you can deal X damage to an enemy after a dwarf deals X damage to it.  So the question was: if the attack uses a dwarf and 2 elves, and the total damage dealt was 2, but the dwarf only contributed 1 attack, power----- is X going to be 1 (the dwarf's maximum contribution) or 2 (the actual damage dealt by the attack).\n\n \n\nThe answer was 1.  That meant that, when declaring multiple attackers, each of the attackers' attack strength remains their own: nobody's statistics are altered.  \n\n \n\nIn my head at least, this is the parallel situation.  When you defend, normally you can only use 1 defender.  Stand Together allows multiple.  Now you have the opportunity to count multiple characters' defense stats, just like you can normally do while attacking.  The defense values don't modify Beorn's base stats, any more than those elves modify the dwarf's attack statistic when you want to use Heavy Stroke.  You still have to deal all of the damage to a single defender, but the defense values are counted individually and not added to Beorn's.\n\n \n\nAnyway, it's purely academic since Beorn+Stand Togther has already been ruled against.\n\nEdited March 5, 2015 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135562-beorn-stand-together/?do=findComment&comment=1476861","commentId":1476861,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1425543674,"content":"@GrandSpleen, i think you mean Stand Together instead of Stand & Fight :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135562-beorn-stand-together/?do=findComment&comment=1477186","commentId":1477186,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1425568437,"content":"Yes, thanks! edited to fit"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135562-beorn-stand-together/?do=findComment&comment=1479278","commentId":1479278,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1425663790,"content":"> This ruling makes no sense if you ask me.\n> \n>  \n> \n> 1.The card targets a player so nothing to Beorn yet.\n> \n>  \n> \n> 2.The card does not declare my defenders for me so therefor I'd say it also does not affect Beorn.

You declare Beorn as a defender as a result of SaF, so he gets targeted by that player card effect.\n\n \n\nif SaF was worded something like \"player may add additonal defenders\" it would be ok IMO.

To make my point more clear, let's take a look at Blade Mastery:\n\n \n\nffg_blade-mastery-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_blade-mastery-core.jpg]\n\n \n\nI think we all agree that Beorn is immune to that card. But what if it was worded: \"Choose a player. That player may add 1 ATT and 1 DEF to one eligible character for the rest of the turn\". Could you boost Beorn in that case? I don't think so, because the card effect still targets him in the same way.\n\n \n\n \n\nI guess the problem of SaF is the initial instruction to \"choose a player\":\n\n \n\n> I believe so as Stand Together targets the player and not Beorn.\n\n \n\nThat's an intuitive and logical assumption, but it doesn't consider that the card's effect doesn't stop or even start here. Choosing a player is simply the first step of excecuting the card's action, but it is not the card action itself. The action is to declare eligible characters as defenders. Which Beorn is totally going to ignore because he's NOT LISTENING...\n\nEdited March 7, 2015 by leptokurt"}]}
