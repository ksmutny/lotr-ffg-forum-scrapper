Looks like theres more too it ( obviously, or that would be a very powerful card)… but i think thats part of the mechanic.\n\nIt looks like you can exhaust dori to take damage in place of a hero who is taking wounds.\n\nI think thror's map lets you exhaust it to swap an active location with a staging area location.\n\nCant really figure out what the leadership card does.\n\n "}]}
