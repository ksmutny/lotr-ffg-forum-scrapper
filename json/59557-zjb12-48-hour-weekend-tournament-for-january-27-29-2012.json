clear out the staging area and any enemies you are engaged with.  Touch nothing, do nothing with your heros, allies etc., unless you have an attachment on an enemy or location, (like ancient mathom, forest snare---if so, just discard these into your discard pile). \n\nYou have made it out of the hills finally, but immediately upon leaving them, you find Wilyador damaged and needing (once again) to see his old buddy Radagast.  Put in the Journey to Rhosgobel encounter deck using the ap's setup on quest card 1A.  Make sure to follow the damage and healing rules!\n\nContinue on in the phase in the round exactly where you left off with Emyn Muil as if just turning over one quest card to another.  There is NO reset of any type for the player's deck, heros, etc.\n\nScoring:  Tabulate your score per standard FFG rules and FAQ 10/31/11.  I will be using the scoring idea that is noted in a post by Juicebox called Measuring Success to acquire a weighted average.\n\nHere's an idea of scoring with 5 attempts, L=loss;  90/L/85/79/L/.  Average score: (90+85+79)/3= 254/3 = 84.67\n\nWin ratio: 5/3 = 1.67\n\nWeighted would be 84.67 * 1.67 = 141.40 (rounded to nearest hundredth.)  This seems like a heavy penalty for losses, but the less losses you have, the penalty lessens, and with no losses, your average score is your weighted score.\n\nEveryone is to play five games so we can have a fair comparison.  You can send in your scores 1 at a time or all together.  I will determine your win ratio factor once I have all your scores and wins and losses. \n\nWhen you post your scores please include: final  threat, damage, dead heros, rounds, and victory points, and heros used, as well as final total.  (When including rounds, give the number of rounds as well as the calculated points).\n\nAt the end of the 48 hours I will post the overall results and placings.  Please post your results to this forum topic.  As scores come in I will try to keep a posted scorecard going!\n\n[A game attempt is considered an attempt as soon as you draw your initial hand of 6 cards.  You may take 1 mulligan at the beginning of the game for your opening hand as per normal rules.] \n\nQuestions?  Please ask!\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585045","commentId":585045,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1327572692,"content":" This may sound easier that it actually is.  I tried several variations of this: take wilyador with you from the beginning in emyn muil applying the two damage per round rule;

Already played for 3 hours now and didn´t find a deck to beat it.\n\nI think you made it way to hard again. For Emyn Muil you have to quest like hell and use some cards to kill locations. But the Wilderlands add big nasty enemies. So you need to fight them. Then you go straight to Rhosgobel. If you didn´t have the resources or cards to reduce you threat, you will likely already have a high threat. Hopefully you have cards to heal Wilyador or else it can be over very soon. \n\nAnd why so many changes? Limiting the cards is one way. Then you have to play 2 completely  different quest in on go and if that´s not enough we have to deal with other cards then the quest was planed for and we could see 4 hill trolls if we are unlucky.....\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585325","commentId":585325,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1327604034,"content":" So your first game didn't beat it then?  Let me know.  I can still reannounce tomorrow morning if I need to with something different.  I have a meeting in just a few minutes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585332","commentId":585332,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1327606479,"content":" Played 6 times to try some decks.

These two are my favorite spheres anyway (Lore > Spirit), but they are especialy well adapted to both Hills of Emyn Muil (Northern Tracker) and Journey to Rhosgopel (Lore of Imladris). It was also interesting to try playing with a single Core Set for a change, although I hope it doesn't become a standard restriction on \"tournament-style\" posts (after all, it's easy enough to make proxies if required). One of the most interesting aspects of this game was the switch of encounter decks in both quests: this gives the quest a fresh look and makes them feel a bit like \"new\" quests.\n\nDeck building - Heroes: I knew I wanted Denethor for sure for his \"peaking\" ability. When playing solo, I always try to use him. I also decided on Eleanor as my Spirit hero, fearing some of the treacheries in these quests. I was left with finding a Warrior or Dunedain hero to complete the trio. I considered Beravor (Dunedain), but with a single Unexpected Courage in the deck, it wasn't that powerful. Also, I needed a quester hero since both Denethor and Eleanor would remained ready most of the time. So I chose Glorfindel. It was my first time playing with him ever except in 4 players game. He's a Warrior, has great stats and his healing ability could come in handy in JtR. I wasn't too worried about the starting threat with 27. In retrospect, I didn't use Eleanor's ability very often, and most of those times, I had A Test of Will in hand anyway. I would probably switch Eleanor for Eowyn as the quester and add Beravor as the Dunedain hero instead. The extra cards would probably have accelerated my play a bit.\n\nDeck building - Player cards: It was also interesting to build from a more limited card pool. I wanted to include Feint at first, until I realized that Song of Battle was out of scope. I went with a Leadership splash for Sneak Attack and Steward of Gondor. I added in a Dunedain Warning to make Denethor an invincible defender and chose to try a Dunedain Cache since I didn't have any eagle nor ranged character. That wasn't a good choice in retrospect: I had not realized how little time would be spent on the JtR quest. Must have for Lore included Lore of Imladris (to heal Wyliador) and Rivendell Minstrel to fetch the two Songs. I only played a single Gildor because of its high cost and I didn't want to find myself stuck with multiple copies of this unique ally. Spirit included the basics: Norther Tracker (star of the deck and a winning condition against THoEM), A Test of Will, The Galadhrim's Greetings, Dwarven Tomb (mostly to replay a GG before winning) and Ancient Mathom as my drawing engine (combines well with Erebor Hammersmith). I only included a single Hasty Stroke since I already had 2 A Burning Brand.\n\nDeck building - What would I change: Haldir wasn't that useful. By the time I had the 4 resources, I was often looking to play other cards (early, I would favor the Minstrel; late, I'd have a Gandalf). Longbeard Map-Maker didn't shine either: I rarely had the resources to make use of him anyway. Not sure what other allies would have been better, however... I could have used more than one The Riddermark's Finest: its ability was great against THoEM and I didn't have any way to recycle him. I should definitively have played the second Protector of Lorien. Ever Vigilant could also have been a good addition to maximize the turns where Gandalf showed. The Strider's Path didn't see much play; maybe Secret Paths would have produced better results against this scenario (the travel costs are not \"expensive\" in THoEM, as opposed to what we see in the Core quests.\n\nThe quests: If I can make one critic about the format and the quest, its that the second part was almost useless. I always completed Journey to Rhosgopel in 2 turns with Lore of Imladris in hand because by then, I had a full army. Also, because THoEM can be won via Northern Tracker (putting the last exploration marker on the last location in staging bringing you to over 20 vp), I often fell into the first round of JtR with a maximized questing army. Either using a different scenario as the first part (THoEM gives you a lot of time to build up your army, although the addition of Wilderlands encounters made for a great challenge) or forcing a bigger reset between the two quests (such as reseting threat, maybe keeping only up to two allies, or some such thing) would have been better.\n\nLoss on the first try: This first game led me to reflect upon the thread about why people find certain quests difficult or easy. The \"experience factor\" was mentionned in that thread, and it's what cost me that first lost. I haven't played often against THoEM. I didn't realize how difficult it may be if you start struggling against a bunch of ever increasing locations. In that game, I found myself engaging an Orc Horse Thieve. I had a choice at one point of trapping it with Forest Snare or playing an ally. I chose to play an ally because at that point, the staging area included a single location (one of the starting Amon location). I defended easily with Denethor, but got Rauros Falls as a shadow card, so the orcs went back in staging. Next round, I got a new location in staging and the extra 3 from the Orc prevented me from making progress. I defended again, but got the same shadow effect. It did the same for a 3rd round in a row. By then, that Orc was mighty and since it never stayed engaged, I didn't get a subsequent chance to trap it. After Denethor died, I scooped. You bet that I immediately trapped these Thieves in subsequent games.\n\nWinning strategy: My games followed the same patterns. I tried to find at least a cheap ally in my starting hand as much as possible. The songs were always played on Glorfindel, along with Steward of Gondor. Denethor got A Burning Brand and Dunedain Warning. Glorfindel got the other attachments: Protector of Lorien and Dunedain Cache. Self-Preservation went were needed, but it ended up being Glorfindel more often than not. The generic pattern was: struggle for the first 2 turns; start stabilizing the field; get Northern Tracker active and then I made progress. By the 6th to 8th turn, I generaly had full board control, knew what was coming and was adjusting in consequence. Gandalf was used for threat lowering most of the games; I may have used him once to kill a Goblin Sniper. I didn't fight many enemies: mostly Eastern Crows and Orc Horse Thieves. I trapped the bigger ones when they showed (kept a Hill Troll trapped for a full game after the valiant sacrifice of an Erebor Hammersmith). By the 4th and 5th game, I was beginning to not worry so much about threat and chose a few time to quest less than needed, taking a threat increase, but allowing me a bit of flexibility (killing an enemy, peeking at the deck to set up a good turn after). I knew that I would always get a few Gandalf in play along with a couple of Galadhrim's Greetings before the end. On the first turn, I always quested with all 3 heroes and any ally I had. That was always the biggest risk I took: meeting a Warg on turn 1 with a lucky shadow card could have destroyed my strategy. Most of the other enemies are over 30 to engage, so with 5 or 6 points of Willpower questing, I was safe. I always traveled to the Amon location that prevents playing Events first so as to try to clear it.\n\nAll in all, a nice \"event\" and I hope to see more about other people's deck choice and gameplay."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=585916","commentId":585916,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1327703653,"content":" Game 2: loss in the hills.  Game 3: miraculous comeback.

This time I got only one enemy (King Spider, first turn of Rhosgobel).\n\n \n\nBefore I give a small review I have a question for you:\n\nI ended Emyn Muil by using Snowbourn Scout's ability during the planning phase to explore the Highlands which got me 20 VP. So how do I continue after switching to the Rhosgobel deck? Am I still in the planning phase of the same turn? Or do I have to move my round marker by 1 and start with the resource phase of the next round? I played it like I still was in the planning phase if the same round. If that's so, one should be careful when finishing Emyn Muil during the questing phase, because the basically loose one turn to explore stage 1B of Emyn Muil, adding two extra damage to Wilyador.\n\nStrategywise this would mean that a player should hold back Snowbourn Scout or use Riddermark's Finest ability so he can finish Emyn Muil before starting the quest phase.\n\n \n\nSo, here's my second adventure:\n\n \n\nHeroes: Prince Imrahil, Théodred, Glorfindel\n\nThreat: 29\n\nDamage: 0\n\nDead Heroes: 0\n\nRounds: 80\n\nVictory Points: 24\n\nResult: 85\n\n \n\nThe encounters were lots of locations (all of them with the Emyn Muil trait!), one Rockslide and some harmless treacheries.

I also had Sneak/Gandalf, Haldir, Snowbourn Scout, 2x Westroad Traveller and Riddermark's Finest as allies during the game.

I played only Emyn Muil with the Wilderland deck, was too lazy to put the Rhosgobel deck together, but I can promise you that it would have taken me only one more round to finish.\n\nThe result was: 12 rounds, 0 damage, 0 threat, 20 VP, 90 points\n\n \n\nI think I got Unexpected Courage in round 4 or 5. The trick is to draw your whole deck, play 2x GG, 2x Sneak/Gandalf, 3x Gandalf. That lowers your threat by 37 points (I didn't even use Dwarven Tomb).

In MTG is quite simple and effective you can draw how much you want but in the end of the turn you should to discard until you have hand size (7cards).\n\nIn 2 players game those rules if they will be added by FFG  make sessions much more interesting and harder and more balanced with power of encounter decks.\n\nThe encounter deck should to react more on the players actions in the game.

The main reason is that those cards were designed as part of the Core set and served to establish the basis upon which all the game mechanics were balanced.\n\nI'm pretty sure they keep Northern Tracker in mind when assigning value to locations, for example. They can assume players will have 2 Trackers at a time (from a single Core set), so any location with a cost of 2 or less to explore could have a major travel cost associated; players have ways to bypass it. However, once a location gets to 3 or more, you know it probably means at least 2 turns of Tracker questing; it's a different issue.\n\nAs for the whole concept of drawing your full deck and reshuffling only a limited number of events (such as Sneak Attack and Gandalf, guaranteeing a quick recycling once your deck is in your hand), I agree it's a powerful strategy and I'm not sure they fully thought it through. Would it warrant as many errata as you suggest (Beravor, Protector of Lorien, Will of the West)? I don't know. But there are other consequences to such changes that need to be considered. For example, if you force players to discard at the end of their turn for having more than X cards in hand, you increase the strength of a card such as Stand or Fight. Limiting Beravor's ability doesn't sound too bad, but other options could have been considered instead (such as making her starting threat higher, like it was done with Bilbo).\n\nIf we knew the form that organized play will take once they implement it, it would help a lot in these kind of debates... looks like it won't be for now (they announced Q1 organized play packages for the other LCG), but maybe before the summer..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59557-zjb12-48-hour-weekend-tournament-for-january-27-29-2012/?do=findComment&comment=587519","commentId":587519,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1327969940,"content":"he has been on about this like a broken record for a long time.. it is NEVER going to happen...

And look on Next cycle preview materials sounds like it will be ok on this way.\n\nBut what about co-op play? Then we come to point when you have 2 players and each play spirit/ Leadership/Lore you have 6 test of will, 6 Hasty stroke, 6 Sneak attack and 6 Gandalf +6 G greetings.Forget 6 UC as well. From certain point (normaly is after 3-4 first rounds) there is no point to play anymore Cose with Crazy Beravur Draw you can Cancel all Revealed effects, Shadow effects, Remove threats and Play Gandalf every round like a devil from Tabaco box..

You know encounter deck and you already can see is done.\n\nIn my opinion this is most bad moment in this game.The game is just starting there is long session ahead but you already know you win! So what the point to play if you know this. From this moment you can start new game already. Very stupid moment!And this is not even the middle of the session. is Just a beginning!\n\nSo in my opinion the rules for co-op game definitely need some erratas or changes.\n\nWhat i do usually when we play with my firend to make game more difficult? I remove from encounter decks  some cards. When we play Carrock i remove Grimbeorn and Locations. When we play KD i remove Torch and Books. But if you compare KD and SOM sure KD is much more harder and more Interesting to play cose there is a lot of Surge effect and also KD have much more Random elements.\n\n "}]}
