Historically, they've ruled that attachments can be played on encounter cards that are \"immune to player card effects.\" For example, Ancient Mathom onto The Carrock. Also, the ruling that card text is not active on any player cards attached to a Nameless enemy (by merit of its Forced effect), is new; they mentioned in the past that it would be a funny and legal (albeit, likely unintentional), means of attaching a Forest Snare to such an enemy.
