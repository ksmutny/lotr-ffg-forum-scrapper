I am 100% with John here this is not the time or place to speak of such things regardless of how serious they may be. \n\nThis is the forum for this specific game and people who love this game (many of which are huge tolkien fans as well) are interested in seeing some news/spoilers which are long long overdue and so we are restless and eager for news.....\n\nhow dare we right? \n\n \n\nI personally would be gutted and most definitely would care if they announced that the game is ending after this cycle and the last two saga boxes....\n\nthere is definitely more than enough material, support and interest for them to do at least one more cycle and hopefully much more. There is so much more they could potentially do and I think many others are in the same boat as me and want this game to last as long as possible.

Silvan's got a nice healer recently, the new dwarf allies are pretty **** powerful (sellsword and azain) and Dunedain got Eldahir and hobbits get ally Sam and Robin Smallburrow. What else will we see? Some more Gondor and Rohan support? More Dale support on top of Lanwyn? More Valour cards?\n\n \n\nI really want to see what the tactics event Last Stand that features Hama does and really want to see what the other tactics event Revealed in Wrath does as well... I'm hoping Revealed in Wrath is one of those cards that allows any player to pay resources of another sphere to activate another effect... seems like it might be a really good card for Noldor decks as it seemingly features Glorfindel. I wonder if it does direct damage or if it boosts a character or what....\n\ni've been using the Marksman of Lorien for a while now and it is amazingly... such great value for its cost...\n\nthe 2 hitpoints is amazing, the bonus when it enters play is great and the 3 base attack AND ranged is fantastic.\n\nIn proper silvan decks with O Lorien and Celeborn it will have even more value!\n\nI wonder what other cards we will see that boost 2 hero decks... I wonder what else they can do (other than bonus resources or stats or readying effects) that will actually achieve this other than secrecy cards..? Will be interesting to see what they do!\n\nArrows from the Trees and Interrogation both look really interesting as well and perhaps Arrows will be a direct damage card?\n\nInterrogation could be any manner of things and maybe it even allows you to manipulate an enemy to look at or even reorder the top few cards of the encounter deck? I wonder if we will see other new traps on top of Entangling Nets which is an amazing card, 1 cost for -2 attack AND -2 defence? makes the enemy both easier to defend against and easier to destroy not to mention various other combos you can pull off like Straight Shot etc.\n\n \n\nFinally behind the new Lanwyn hero and behind Eldahir and what I assume is Captain's Wisdom there appears to be a new ally that is some sort of muscly person with a glove and what appears to me to be a hammer or smithing tool. Looks like we will get another smith type ally, can't tell if its a man or dwarf or even elf from just that arm or even what sphere the card is but I am still very curious as to what this ally might do.\n\nEdited April 3, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131352-so-are-we-getting-any-previews-ever/?do=findComment&comment=2147315","commentId":2147315,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1459685885,"content":"Speculation is good, but I want some solid info already :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131352-so-are-we-getting-any-previews-ever/?do=findComment&comment=2147317","commentId":2147317,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1459685993,"content":"yeah me too... :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]\n\nits getting crazy. we better get two news articles at once! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131352-so-are-we-getting-any-previews-ever/?do=findComment&comment=2147740","commentId":2147740,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1459709844,"content":"What I'm most curious about is the Gondor support we're getting this cycle.

It can also be insanely luck based and you might get no symbols on like 5 cards or like 3 symbols on just 2 cards which I really don't like... \n\nI love the lost island mechanic and double sided locations.\n\nI like that location threat is fairly static or at least fairly easy to predict in this quest. Yes there may be several lost islands but you know until you travel to them they are all 2 threat (or 3 if that certain treachery appears!) and you know they will only increase if you get to stage 2 or get that treachery that adds an extra one to staging.\n\nThey replace each other when you travel but do not appear otherwise again except for that one treachery or stage 2's effect.\n\nI find this stops location lock and makes it way easier to deal with locations in general.\n\n \n\nI actually sort of wish every quest was designed like this with a separate deck for locations and a new one only gets added to staging once you travel to a location already in play. Double sided locations is awesome too but I don't think they should be like that for every quest, just certain ones. \n\nAll that being said it is an extremely easy quest (for my decks at least) and I haven't lost a game against it yet.\n\nI've lost more than one attempt at both other quests in the box so for me it is definitely the easiest.\n\n \n\nHonestly after Carn Dum and Dread Realm I think I prefer easier quests now though.... its just more fun to see your deck work properly and to have several smaller exciting moments that you have to overcome than seeing your deck get slowly decimated and barely hanging on all game and being ready to restart everything at any possible moment every turn.\n\nI'm just not interested in restarting several times in a row on turn 2 or 3 with a game that requires as much space and setup as this one does, especially playing two handed...\n \n\nI suspect that this might be why people don't like this quest though? It really has very little teeth and is pretty **** easy to beat (I find that the Throngs of Unfaithful are perhaps one of the worst cards just because they almost never go away) and I know most people don't enjoy overly easy quests. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131352-so-are-we-getting-any-previews-ever/?do=findComment&comment=2151559","commentId":2151559,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1459868416,"content":"My first experience with the quest was a mono-tactics deck and a version of my Rapid Fire Gandalf enabler deck.

We are a bunch of lads who love this game not only for it's Tolkien's flavour but also because it's mechanically sound and we have a great fun during a play. Anyways unfortunately we have to devote a lot of money to this game which makes us not only players but also customers. Exactly - customers. That's why in my personal estimation FFG should let us know what is going on and why is there such a huge delay in delivery as well as in providing us any news on the forum.

Anyway, that first sailing quest may not be in the greatest ever, but it's a perfectly fine and playable quest.

I hate their inane secrecy. I should become a playtester for every game just so that I don't have to deal with the secrecy. My guess is that there will be one more cycle after this, and the final Saga will be released at Gencon 2017, followed by the final packs in cycle 7 to end the game around Worlds 2017. Then we get to work on the legacy project. I've got quite a few plans already for organizing it.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd then, my Runebound LCG I have been designing forever will get accepted by LCG and published! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nYeah right."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131352-so-are-we-getting-any-previews-ever/?do=findComment&comment=2302734","commentId":2302734,"userName":"Mikallo","timestamp":1468121399,"content":"I felt like taking a moment between news posts to pause and remember.\n\n \n\n*Lights a candle*\n\n \n\nMay it be many moons before this thread becomes necro'd and relevant again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131352-so-are-we-getting-any-previews-ever/?do=findComment&comment=2302829","commentId":2302829,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1468132530,"content":"Well, necro-ing it yourself doesn't really help.
