I was thinking Frodo's ability would not work because a forced response might take precidence over a response. Also, Frodo's text says, \"after Frodo is damage, cancel the damage and instead...\" so it seems like the conditions are met for the Muck Adder's effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51401-frodo-vs-muck-adder/?do=findComment&comment=513268","commentId":513268,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1313096729,"content":" I'm gonna agree with BranWheatKillah here.  My rationale is thus:\n\nRulebook, page 23, regarding Forced effects, states \"These effects initiate and resolve immediately, whenever their specified prerequisite occurs.\" (emphasis mine)\n\nSame page, regarding Responses, states \"Responses are always optional, and can be triggered by their controller in response to (i.e., immediately after) a specified game occurrence.\"\n\nWith this in mind, I think that your Muck Adder's attack would be resolved as follows:\n\n1. If undefended: \"all damage from the attack must be assigned to a single hero controlled by the active player\" (Frodo), or if not undefended, after subtracting his defense, \"the remaining value is the amount of damage that must immediately be dealt to the defending character...\"\n\n2. As Frodo's response can now be triggered, if you choose to use his ability it will \"cancel the damage and instead raise your threat by the amount of damage he would have been dealt.\"\n\n3. As the damage has been cancelled, Frodo has never actually taken any damage, so the Forced effect on Muck Adder does not activate.\n\nIts really the same question people had when they asked, \"Can Frodo's ability only cancel 1 damage?  That is, would any time he takes 2 or more damage cause him to be immediately destroyed before he could activate his ability?\"\n\nIn the \"Walks in the Twilight\" article, they say: \"Frodo’s ability gives you one of the rare opportunities to survive an enemy like Hummerhorns. And since you can use his response once each phase, he could survive an Evil Storm even while wounded and then still survive Hummerhorns.\"\n\nSo dubious phrasing or not, it seems as though the designer's intent was for Frodo to shrug off extra damage, and as both the Forced effect and taking damage in excess of one's defense happen \"immediately,\" I vote that Frodo survives."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51401-frodo-vs-muck-adder/?do=findComment&comment=513387","commentId":513387,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1313116396,"content":"We also played it that Frodo survives: he cancels the damage dealt to him, why he should suffer the effect of being damaged then?

Example: Tower Gate reads, Forced: After travelling to Tower Gate... If a player wishes to play a response such as Strength of Will after the players travel to Tower Gate, he must wait until after the forced response resolves.\n\nStrength of Will says: Response: After you travel to a location....\n\nSimilarly, Muck Adder says: Forced: If Muck Adder damages an enemy... and Frodo says: Response: After Frodo Baggins is damaged, cancel the damage....\n\nSeems like pretty much the exact situation described in the FAQ so for now I would assume poor Frodo will be no more since he takes the damage and is unable to cancel until after the forced effect is fully resolved (unless FFG modifys the FAQ :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51401-frodo-vs-muck-adder/?do=findComment&comment=513739","commentId":513739,"userName":"sWhiteboy","timestamp":1313164812,"content":"That seems like it would be right, but with the other LCGs, cancel/save effects are not the same as normal responses.  They actually happen during the action they respond too instead of after the fact."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51401-frodo-vs-muck-adder/?do=findComment&comment=513760","commentId":513760,"userName":"Valyrian Steel","timestamp":1313167485,"content":"I absolutely agree with you.
