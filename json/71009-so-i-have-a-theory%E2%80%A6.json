We got four heroes and four allies in OHaUH, I think it will be the same here. Further, I really believe we shall see Gloin, Dwalin, Bifur and Bombur again, so that the saga has all thirteen Dwarves included. Those four plus Balin and Oin (previously not released) would only leave two spots for non-Dwarven characters but if one takes a look at the characters in the Hobbit, there really might only be Bard and Thranduil appropriate. Of course we could get another Dain but that would probably be pointless as the initial version is so good. Gwaihir could further complicate matters but perhaps Eagles can re-appear in later adventures.\n\nSo, if it is really Balin, Dwalin, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bombur, Thranduil and Bard, I should try and put them into categories. I think Balin, Bard and Thranduil are pretty sure for heroes, perhaps Oin might get the final hero spot as Dwalin, Gloin and Bifur had already got one. It would leave Bombur for a double ally, same as his brother.\n\nNow for spheres, Bard seems set for Tactics (Black Arrow would support the notion). It would just mean no Tactics Dwarf heroes in the Hobbit, why not after all. Thranduil for Leadership, being King and all, not a sure bet though as we have Brand in Tactics and Denethor in Lore. Still, I would probably think Leadership because we already have three Leadership Dwarf heroes. Balin Spirit, Oin Lore. Here the \"educated\" guess is quickly becoming a wild speculation. Bombur's second ally version could be spirit, fits that better than Lore for me.\n\nOf course, I might be off with the returning Dwarves but I really do not see that many book characters filling the numbers instead. Beside Gwaihir, there are few named characters, and Master of the Lake-town would not seem fit a player card in the first place.\n\nWhat do you think?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71009-so-i-have-a-theory%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=693764","commentId":693764,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1347642289,"content":"i think you should be around correct there, or at least on the right lines\n\ni have been wondering about thranduil most, as silvan need some love and if we get thranduil, whenever thay may be youd think wed get some silvan allies….and perhaps we shall given that mirkwood is involved heavily in this stage of the book, though perhaps seeing as the spiders are the enemies in the quest and not elves as speculated, thranduil may not be an objective as i thought so this gives support to him as a hero..\n\ni think that he will be something like\n\nThranduil- leadership\n\nthreat 13\n\nwillpower 4\n\nattack  1\n\ndefense 2\n\nhitpoints 5\n\nQuest action- while thranduil is ready during the quest phase , all enemies recieve 1 damage as they are revelaed from the encounter deck\n\n \n\nthis means even though you have 4 willpower you will need to think if he is not better being ready. also i think its important silvan have a 'camoflague' as ive said in earlier posts so the damage represents swift and secret arrows\n\nrich\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71009-so-i-have-a-theory%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=693782","commentId":693782,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1347644761,"content":" I don't believe that Thranduil will apear as a hero or as an ally, because in The Hobbit he is not a very goog friend to the company.

I was thinking of the characters in the first place but it is true that for a large part Thranduil is more of an antagonist in the story. However, you could still use Legolas and say Denethor for the quests so I am not sure they will be so strict. Perhaps one quest shall have Thranduil as an objective so that you will not be able to take his hero card for that one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71009-so-i-have-a-theory%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=693998","commentId":693998,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1347688206,"content":"richsabre said:\n\ni think you should be around correct there, or at least on the right lines\n\ni have been wondering about thranduil most, as silvan need some love and if we get thranduil, whenever thay may be youd think wed get some silvan allies….and perhaps we shall given that mirkwood is involved heavily in this stage of the book, though perhaps seeing as the spiders are the enemies in the quest and not elves as speculated, thranduil may not be an objective as i thought so this gives support to him as a hero..\n\ni think that he will be something like\n\nThranduil- leadership\n\nthreat 13\n\nwillpower 4\n\nattack  1\n\ndefense 2\n\nhitpoints 5\n\nQuest action- while thranduil is ready during the quest phase , all enemies recieve 1 damage as they are revelaed from the encounter deck\n\n this means even though you have 4 willpower you will need to think if he is not better being ready. also i think its important silvan have a 'camoflague' as ive said in earlier posts so the damage represents swift and secret arrows\n\nrich\n\n \n\nI do not think Thranduil's willpower will be greater than 2.
