If you just reveal the card, should you flip Thaurdir at the end of the quest phase? Despite it never was the active quest.\n\n \n\nForced: When at least 1 progress is placed on Furious Charge, each character gets –2 [Defense] until the end of the round. If Thaurdir is Captain side face-up, flip him.\nResponse: After Furious Charge is defeated, add 10 progress to the main quest. \n\n \n\nGreets\nJban\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264412-furious-charge/?do=findComment&comment=3106183","commentId":3106183,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1512225811,"content":"I think that Forced trigger will only happen if you place progress.  Obviously the 1st part of the trigger only happens in that case.  I'm not 100% sure about that 2nd sentence, because the effect doesn't use the word \"Then.\"  But if it came up in my own came, I would only resolve it if I placed progress."}]}
