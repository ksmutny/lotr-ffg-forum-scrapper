Each player has to put one enemy into the staging area.  The enemy can come from the encounter deck or from the encounter deck discard pile -- your choice.  If there are no enemies in the discard pile, they'll have to come from the encounter deck itself (and the reverse is also true).\n\n2. Deal a shadow card, and you may declare a defender.  That's from the official FAQ in two places:\n\n \n\n(1.26) Enemy attacks outside of the combat phase\nIf an enemy attacks outside of the combat phase, it is still dealt a shadow card at the beginning of the attack. Then follow the 4 steps under Phase 6 “Combat” in the rules. (pg. 5)\nand\nQ: When an enemy makes an attack against me from the staging area, can I declare a defender?\nA: Yes. If an enemy attacks you, you can exhaust 1 character you control to declare it as a defender against that attack, whether that enemy is engaged with you or not. (pg. 9)\n \n3. Yeah, you can still optionally engage enemies with Ranger Spikes attached.\n \n4. Correct!\n\n "}]}
