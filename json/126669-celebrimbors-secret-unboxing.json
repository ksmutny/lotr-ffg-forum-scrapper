To make this combo good you need some setup time to get out other attachments like the mounts and if you want to use Forth Eorlingas effectivly you need the enemys in the staging area which is unlikely to happen later in the game. And 4 ressources just to mow down the staging area with still maybe 2 enemys left in play down in some players attacking zone... I don't think thats worth it. I like the idea behind the card but I highly doubt that you could set up a massiv attack to the staging area regulary in a game.\n\nOther more likely way for 4 ressources to spend could be to Hammerstroke every enemy to your side of the table, defend with Boromir multiple times (+ some chump blocking) and then use Charge of the Rohirim for a wipe out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1327706","commentId":1327706,"userName":"Scroll Lock","timestamp":1415531512,"content":"I said you CAN use it with Forth E, not have to.

Gandalf with another noble hero would also go well with this since his staff is another form of repeatable resource addition.  I think it will also pair well with horn of gondor if you have a definitive plan to chump block and i can see some shenanigans with Miruvor as well.\n\n \n\nOrophin-  Not too much was revealed that wasnt already strongly suggested from the partial wording of his effect we could previously see.  Hes obviously a staple in Silvan decks, I personally think i'll use him to bring back the much maligned yet underrated in my opinion defender of the naith who is really one of the only decent defenders the trait has\n\n \n\nHenneth Annun Guard- I actually really like this card...BUT i'm not sure how often he'll actually see play, theres just a lot of options for high cost tactics allies.  Giving credit where credit is due, this is probably one of the better doomed allies we've seen.  The herald of arnor was good too but the others, the ability was just not impactful enough.  In a gondor themed deck he could flourish.\n\n \n\nCharge of the Rohhirm- I do think its a good card but i think it has to been seen as a kind of supplementary effect not something to rely on.  As mentioned by others before its a good board sweep card.  I'll also look forward to unthematic hijinks with this by using it with gandalf/shadofax and Glorfindel/asfaloth.\n\n \n\nGaladriel's Handmaiden- the spirit ally everyone knew was coming.  probably the weakest of all the \"when entering play\" effects but as the TC guys mentioned in the video her 2 will power makes her just a solid questing ally in her own right.\n\n \n\nMirror of Galadriel-  How cool is this card? Just a great thematic win.  Reminds me of palantir in regards to player cards that have powerful but also negative effects but i think this one is much more worth the risk.  Any card in the top 10 is just so good for this game especially if you're running a deck without lore so card drawing may be a premium.  I cant wait to to run this and see it in action.\n\n \n\nLorien Cloak- i generally really hate playercards that are scenario dependent aka all those mountain dependent cards from the darrowdelf cycle but I still think this one is very playable in its own right.  Even if its just a cheap +1 defense boost in a sphere that doesnt often see things like that.  Also really pleased its not restricted because that would have killed its playability.  I think it'll make a nice addition for either elf trait."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1328009","commentId":1328009,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1415554775,"content":"Regarding Henneth Annun Guard... how can you not be sure about this card?

Once he has 3 defense, he becomes much more useful. You could also give him Elven Mail, which has a limited effect due to Defender of the Naith already having sentinel, but it's still pretty good. Kinda sucks that you need so many card to have a decent Silvan defender though.\n\nEdited November 9, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1328069","commentId":1328069,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1415560181,"content":"> Charge of the Rohhirm- I do think its a good card but i think it has to been seen as a kind of supplementary effect not something to rely on.  As mentioned by others before its a good board sweep card.  I'll also look forward to unthematic hijinks with this by using it with gandalf/shadofax and Glorfindel/asfaloth.\n\nThe unthematic hijinks will only work if you also include Nor Am I A Stranger, since it did specify Rohan characters."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1328077","commentId":1328077,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1415560390,"content":"It's obviously both Gandalf and Glor with NAIAS, it'll just be a good ol' multiplayer setup, no one in their minds gonna do this within one deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126669-celebrimbors-secret-unboxing/?do=findComment&comment=1328089","commentId":1328089,"userName":"FetaCheese","timestamp":1415561041,"content":"I think people are underestimating the Handmaiden.
