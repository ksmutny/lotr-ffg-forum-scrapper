I think that a strict reading of the rules might mean that, when the players are separated, each player would be able to have duplicates of the same unique in play. This, however, would be silly. There would also be no rule to cover what would happen when the players were reunited.\n\n2. A more significant question: when the players are separated, is the player with the first player marker the only first player still, or would each player be considered to be first player, as if they were each playing solo? This affects a number of key cards eg Deep Deep Dark and Sudden Pitfall. I am playing the latter interpretation at the moment."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66692-foundation-of-stone-questions/?do=findComment&comment=652120","commentId":652120,"userName":"Sprenger","timestamp":1341071211,"content":"How does Bilbo's card draw work once the players are seperated?

Who is considered the last player when the Orcs that engages the last player shows up?\n\n \n\n*Edit\n\nI guess I should read threads instead of just skimming for key words. (Somehow I missed the reference to Bilbo 3+ posts up).

(And post the answer in the forums, please gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]). Here is how we resolved those things, although some (reasonable) guessing is included:\n\n * The rules page only forbids cards of player A to do something with player B or cards of player B. It doesn't mention anything about the First Player Token. So we assumed the First Player is switching from player to player just as usual.\n * This means in a 2 player game, that only the player controlling Bilbo will get the additional card draw, but only every second turn. (Reason: In the turn in which he is the First Player, he gains the card draw. In the turn the other player is the First Player, Bilbo tries to affect another player - which fails, because the players are separated, and such an effect is forbidden by the rules sheet.)\n * Elladan and Elrohir under control of 2 different players in 2 different staging areas still get their +2. This is because the card text of Elladan/Elrohir only check if there is a specific card in play (the brother), but doesn't do anything to the other card. In fact, Elladan only does do something to himself, and Elrohir only does something to himself. So it is not forbidden.\n * Similarly, when trying to play a unique card which is already under control of a player in another staging area, the playing of that card fails, because the check as stated in core set rules p. 8 (if another card with the same name already exists in play) is still valid and not forbidden by the rules sheet. So it's not possible to have 2 Arwens under control of 2 players in different staging ares, for example.\n * Encounter cards only affect players who are in the staging area in which they are, by the rules sheet. This means that an enemy usually engaging the Last Player will engage no one if the Last Player currently isn't in the staging area where that enemy is. The effect just fails. This is balanced, since Bilbo's effect also fails when targeting the \"wrong\" player.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66692-foundation-of-stone-questions/?do=findComment&comment=652270","commentId":652270,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1341109534,"content":"HilariousPete said:\n\n \n\nWow, other good questions ;-) I think the best would be to send a rules question to FFG.

We played several of these points rather differently:\n\n- we continued to switch the First Player token for the reasons you state, but we played it that each player was both first and last player while separated.\n\n- effects like Elladan and Elrohir I definitely think should be switched off due to the clause \"the resolution of each phase occurs as if only the player or players that share any given staging area are currently present in the game\".\n\n- we played that uniqueness still applies, even though I think a strict reading of the rules would say otherwise (because the alternative is silly)\n\nFFG tried to give precise rules to define this new situation of separated players, but unfortunately (weak playtesters again?) they haven't addressed a number of questions that arise as soon as you sit down and play the game.\n\nI have put these and other FOS questions to FFG and will post if I get an answer."}]}
