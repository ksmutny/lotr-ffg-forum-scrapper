So this must not be the Necromancer build up but the later build up getting ready for the war in the north. Sauron sends a Nazgul to Dol Guldur during this period, I believe, to get ready for the war against Thranduil, Lorien and Erebor. That is a shame, I was hoping we'd get to participate in the raid on Dol Guldur by Gandalf and the White Council."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43505-necromancer/?do=findComment&comment=438363","commentId":438363,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1300183827,"content":"That's correct he sends Khamul, the second Nazgul to Dol Guldur to \"reopen the doors\" so to speak."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43505-necromancer/?do=findComment&comment=438774","commentId":438774,"userName":"cootewards","timestamp":1300248950,"content":"Yes that all sounds right.\n\nSo it would seem the first cycle of adventure packs will be our first chance to actually take over the roles from a significant event from the actual lore.\n\nThe hunt for Gollum and his imprisonment with the elfs in Mirkwood. Interestingly how close does this happen to Frodo's 50th birthday and him setting off from Bag End?  I assumed it was pretty close as Legolas is at Rivendel to let Elrond know he's escaped.\n\nI assume this means that the expansions won't be moving forward in time from one to the other through the 17 year period.\n\nAlso the Rules say that the deluxe expansions will introduce new areas, and the adventure pack that follows I assume will also be based in those regions. So I guess we could be seeing events that \"actually\" happened concurrently in later sets."}]}
