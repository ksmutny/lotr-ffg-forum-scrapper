The encounter deck gets only reshuffled fully in the quest phase and never in a different phase right? (Unless something tells you to) Today I played the most lovely quest Battle of the Five Armies and we were engaged with 5 enemies and there were exactly 5 cards left in the encounter deck, so afterwards it was empty. Then, I wanted to use Stings effect and defend with Bilbo, but there were no cards left to discard, so too bad?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193098-reshuffling-the-encounter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1884422","commentId":1884422,"userName":"Nizi","timestamp":1446931403,"content":"I'm afraid so, yes. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193098-reshuffling-the-encounter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1884439","commentId":1884439,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1446932747,"content":"We won anyways, Bilbo had Sting and Mithril Shirt attached and it was a Gundabad Climmer attacking for 2 and that round I played Lure of Moria and my fellow player was engaged with Bolg and was able to destroy Bolg with a whopping 27 att!
