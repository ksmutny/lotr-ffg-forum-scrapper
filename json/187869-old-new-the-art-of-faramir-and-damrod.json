I remember finding similar art similarities a couple of time in the past (maybe Fatty Bolger and Dagger of Westernesse, to some degree, though not really. Or Beregond), but it's really hard to know if those are intentional homages or just that these are some specific characters, items and locations that were either so well described in the books or was given some definitive artistic interpretation by some third artist, that anyone drawing them is bound to come up with something the reminds you of past art.\n\nThe Faramir-Damrod thing, however, is just uncanny. Most of all the pose.\n\nMaybe we should interview some of these artists!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187869-old-new-the-art-of-faramir-and-damrod/?do=findComment&comment=1785318","commentId":1785318,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1441868850,"content":"Why on earth does Faramir have the Dunadan trait?

It just means that character is a member of the Dunedain.

So calling him a Dúnadan is no great stretch, I think, though we certainly don't often think of him as one.
