I do however think many aspects were done well, and sam is one of them. however my point for saying this is that while he acted sam well, i still do not think that artisits should draw on the actor himself- i mean, i cannot imagine picturing the actors when i read the books, but i must admit i'd be pretty annoyed if i saw the guy off pirates of the caribbean every time i pictured legolas, or Sharpe everytime i imagined boromir.\n\n \n\nIts rather hard to avoid these problems when the artists depict them as so similar\n\nEdited July 12, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85872-new-card-spoiler-br/?do=findComment&comment=813060","commentId":813060,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1373656763,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > > yes, there is a thread about this\n> > > \n> > > http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/85681-black-riders-spoiler-sorta/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/85681-black-riders-spoiler-sorta/]\n> > > \n> > >  \n> > > \n> > > i think it sam...shame if it is as it is obvious where the inspiration (heavily) has come from\n> > > \n> > > personally im hoping its fatty....but its probably sam\n> > > \n> > > rich\n> > \n> > What's wrong with it looking like Sean Austin?  What is it supposed to look like?  I don't think that its so bad.  Now if you like pippin (you said before that he is officially your favorite art) than i dont see how you can not like sam.  I think pippin looks like some wierd rockstar guy from a band.  the way his hair and face look.  sam looks more normal at least\n> > \n> >  \n> \n> i dont see it on pippin (thankfully) but everyone for different tastes. as for the annoyance with the art, it comes from the similarities with the film characters, not the actual 'look'. i would much rather get a denethor (lore) type art, which i dont consider particularly good, than get someone who looks like john noble.\n> \n> [...]\n> \n> (i believe im right in saying Howe was a design consultant?)\n> \n> [...]\n> \n> i just wanted to point out, given my above post, that that is not the case. i love the films....i think they are terrible adaptions, [...]\n\nI just wanted to piggyback on these rich. I would actually love to see a \"John Noble\" Denethor card, that would be almost as good as an alternate art Boromir featuring Sean Bean smiling, too bad such a photo doesn't exist! (I think CotR podcast brought this up)\n\n \n\nYes, Howe and that other guy (just kidding Alan Lee) were credited consultants, and cameo-ed in the prologue (I think) as two of the nine Kings of Men (apparently Ted Nasmith was asked to consult but declined because he was busy. Nevertheless a lot of his art seems to have been hijacked--see this site: http://tednasmith.narod.ru/ [http://tednasmith.narod.ru/] --and, perhaps unsurprisingly, went uncredited)\n\n \n\nI feel the same about the films (despite my harping about Jackson's 'trilogy' in another thread recently): well done (as films, fun to watch, terrible adaptations)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85872-new-card-spoiler-br/?do=findComment&comment=813065","commentId":813065,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373657126,"content":"yes, howe and nasmith are my favourites amongst classic tolkien art, though i think nasmith wins for me\n\nrich"}]}
