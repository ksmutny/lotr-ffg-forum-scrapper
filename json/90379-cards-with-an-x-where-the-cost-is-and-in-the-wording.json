Well it's actually very easy. X is usually one of the following: resources, players, cards or threads. In your examples the first card it is referring to resources. How many resources you spent is that many card you can look through. In the next card x is referring to the cost of the ally you wanna play.\n\nI'll return shortly with a page from the rule book that will explain it more thoroughly :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEDIT: Okay. You are right. It doesn't refere to it in the rules directly. So the best to remember is like this:\n\n- if X is in the top left on player cards it is referring to the cost of that card X=resources.\n\n- if X is in the top left on an encounter card it should be explained on that particular card. If no it is usually refering to the threat of that card to be the number of players.\n\nEdited September 14, 2013 by mr.thomasschmidt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90379-cards-with-an-x-where-the-cost-is-and-in-the-wording/?do=findComment&comment=866267","commentId":866267,"userName":"Trumpet","timestamp":1379177960,"content":"Cheers for the quick reply, I knew it would be something simple, do you know if many cards have this X text."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90379-cards-with-an-x-where-the-cost-is-and-in-the-wording/?do=findComment&comment=866270","commentId":866270,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1379178331,"content":"not many, but they are perhaps 1 per encounter set. they are usually ones like Deal X damage to characters where X is the amount of characters you control\n\nÂ \n\nit is the designers way of scaling the game\n\nrich"}]}
