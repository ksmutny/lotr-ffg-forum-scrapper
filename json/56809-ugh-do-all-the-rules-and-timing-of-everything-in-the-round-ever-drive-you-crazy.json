I wouldn't have looked twice at the game if it wasn't for the excellent artwork. All LCGs have hideously complex rules, LotR is not an exception. I also enjoy playing CoC a lot more than LotR. Still for me LotR has two advantages over CoC:\n\n- It's cooperative which means it's of interest to some of my friends who don't care about competitive games.\n\n- It's available in German which is fundamental, otherwise I wouldn't find other players at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56809-ugh-do-all-the-rules-and-timing-of-everything-in-the-round-ever-drive-you-crazy/?do=findComment&comment=561035","commentId":561035,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1322452127,"content":"As an Arkham Horror player, I can tell you that LOTR is quite easy compared to AH, considering all its expansions, which introduced many new concepts and mechanisms.

Also there is a number of turn sequence rules that are modified by card rules, so it is very easy to miss say, not being able to draw cards that round as your traveled location now says you can't.\n\nThis can be furctrating to new players, I know it was to me. I think it took me about 5 or 6 play thoughs before I played Escape with zero rule errors. And that is just what you have to do, learn the game, keep playing have fun and then play again. After a bit you will start to have flawless games.\n\nThen cool thing is that once you learn the base rules correctly they do not get modified so once that is down it is sweet, the hard thing is remembering everything that is modifying everything every turn. Personally I use glass counters to mark a cards that have ongoing effects. Also we have a house rule that all cards need to be compleatly read when placed on the table. If there is a doom or surge or other such affect, on goes the glass counter till it is done with. This isn't as tedious as it sounds, infact it really pushes the theme and vibe of the game imo. Once you get good you do not need this crutch, but I would recommend this to new and even mid level players\n\nThis is one of the reasons I do not care about the quest log. I would bet that the majority of those records are from people that are playing incorrectly.\n\nzeb said:\n\nAs an Arkham Horror player, I can tell you that LOTR is quite easy compared to AH, considering all its expansions, which introduced many new concepts and mechanisms.
