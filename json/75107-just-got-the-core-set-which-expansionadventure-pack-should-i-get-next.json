Some adventure packs require an expansion? Is there any must haves that are really fun? I'm not really playing competitively, mostly just something casual with my friend. So I don't really care about building crazy good decks. I actually prefer single color decks. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75107-just-got-the-core-set-which-expansionadventure-pack-should-i-get-next/?do=findComment&comment=730292","commentId":730292,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1354617959,"content":"hey\n\nadventure packs are the smaller monthly expansions, released in a cycle of 6 packs. each cycle is kicked off by a larger deluxe expansion pack which is required to play the following 6\n\nthe first cyle (mirkwood) does not need a deluxe pack as the core set acts as this, so if you want to get stuck into packs right away then this is the cycle for you\n\nit also makes sense to go in order in my opinion. difficulty is made for cards from the core set only and you get to play in order theme wise. you also dont miss out on any great  cards. i know you said you are playing lighthearted but i really think you will be missing out on some great cards if you skip the entire mirkwood cycle\n\nso my advice is take this cycle first, probably pack 1- hunt for golllum\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75107-just-got-the-core-set-which-expansionadventure-pack-should-i-get-next/?do=findComment&comment=730305","commentId":730305,"userName":"matthewordie","timestamp":1354619299,"content":"yeah I was actually looking at that AP.
