From the makers of \"War of the Ring [http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/115746/war-of-the-ring-second-edition]\" comes \"Battle of the 5 Armies [http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135219/the-battle-of-five-armies]\" spoiled at GAMMA.. coming soon!! \n\n \n\nClipboard_2.jpg [http://s7.postimg.org/gf6ktmcqj/Clipboard_2.jpg]\n\n \n\nFFG should be making these games! We have a few fun LoTR games and we have Lord of the Ring: Confrontation [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=55&enmi=Lord%20of%20the%20Rings:%20The%20Confrontation] .... but with FFGs licence and skill they should make a ubr strategy game... maybe do Helms Deep, that is still not a game .. . . yet."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102553-off-topic-something-you-guys-may-be-interested-in/?do=findComment&comment=1030075","commentId":1030075,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1395986622,"content":"From the box... \"The Epic Final Battle of The Hobbit\" ( Add in fine print ) \"That lasts a total of 2 pages....\"\n\n:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nJust kidding. Anyway, looks interesting. Although, I'm not sure this is the best forum to put this on. Maybe BGG might be better?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102553-off-topic-something-you-guys-may-be-interested-in/?do=findComment&comment=1030370","commentId":1030370,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1396017420,"content":"FFG was the original distributor of The War of the Ring and also Battles of the Third Age which was the expansion. (I was on the play test team for the latter.) Battles contains an expansion to WotR and also two 'theatre' games for Rohan and Gondor. helms Deep is part of the Rohan game, but it is only a part. After Nexus fell apart things got messy as I understand it and now the game is being made by Aries and FFG is out of the loop.\n\nThe game series is really good on the whole and I was continually amazed at how erudite the designers were on the books. I've already got my copies of Five Armies reserved."}]}
