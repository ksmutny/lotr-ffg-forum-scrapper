I wrote a whole Steam guide [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1884235711] on this strategy of action advantage and board control. The problem for the game, however, is it takes quite a while before this level of strategy becomes apparent, let alone manipulable, by new players to the game.\n\nEdited December 18, 2019 by Kjeld"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303474-lord-of-the-rings-card-game-by-asmodee/?do=findComment&comment=3852761","commentId":3852761,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1576815038,"content":"You are absolutely right.  There is certainly a strategic design there.  But I do stand by my original take that it feels frustratingly limited to me at least.  The more open-ended feeling from the tabletop game where you assess your options, build up your tactic for the turn, then execute and react is simply not there.  It's just a different game - as I said - for better or worse.  Some will enjoy the new pace and structure and others won't.  I enjoy the format of the tabletop game to the point where the digital felt confining and it was not what I wanted.  The original lets me, in some small way, play around in the world of Middle-Earth through these scenarios.  The digital had me much more strictly playing the rules to gain - as you said - action advantage, rather than enjoying the lore and imagining the adventure represented by the ingredients.  \n\nNot a bad game in design or balance, but it's not the same.  Potential buyers: just do your homework and check it out before you buy.  FYI, that's a good guide you've got there."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303474-lord-of-the-rings-card-game-by-asmodee/?do=findComment&comment=3852795","commentId":3852795,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1576820063,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Distractionbeast said:\n> \n> The original lets me, in some small way, play around in the world of Middle-Earth through these scenarios.  The digital had me much more strictly playing the rules to gain - as you said - action advantage, rather than enjoying the lore and imagining the adventure represented by the ingredients.  \n\nThis is true. What the digital game lacks is real immersion in the story, at least as far as the game play goes.

That being said I still was compelled enough to play through all the missions. It needs polish, and I honestly cant put my finger on exactly what would get it up to snuff, but it is hard to envision it ever being remotely on the level of the physical game- though that is mainly me praising the LCG as opposed to saying the digital version has no potential. "}]}
