After this 1st attack he got his 1st token. We could destroy him with our player attack. He could never attack a 2nd time with his boosted 5 attack points.\n\nIs that right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249646-chieftain-ufthak-card-wording/?do=findComment&comment=2784654","commentId":2784654,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1494636273,"content":"That is right.
