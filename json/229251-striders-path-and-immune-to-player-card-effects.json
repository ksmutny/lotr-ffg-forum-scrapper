I seem to recall it was related to locations in the Laketown POD quest, but I am fuzzy on the details. Anyway, 1.34 clearly says there can be two active locations.\n\nIn 1.47 of the FAQ it talks about \"immune to player card effects\" and lists \"moving a card\" as a specific thing that the text prevents. I think that shuts the door on any ruling that says Carrock is moved.\n\nAs I see it, then, the only two outcomes left are:\n\n1.Strider's Path targets only one location when played and it is therefore a legal play. The second effect is not essential but only triggers after the main effect resolves. Normally it would move the active location back to staging, but if the active location is immune then the play results in 2 active locations.\n\n2.Strider's Path targets two locations if there is an active location, therefore if the active location is immune then Strider's Path becomes an illegal play.\n\nMy money is on outcome 1\n\nEdited September 4, 2016 by DukeWellington"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229251-striders-path-and-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=2398877","commentId":2398877,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1472979360,"content":"> So are we thinking the core set manual's \"the players can only travel to one location at a time\" is a restriction on travelling only (and has no bearing on card effects)?\n\n \n\nI think that I disagree with most of the conclusions in this thread, and GrandSpleen has hit on why. I think that this rule will affect any card that tells the players to \"travel\" to a location. So not just the normal framework effect, but Strider's Path and Ghân-buri-Ghân [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Ghan-buri-Ghan-TFotW] (which both use the word \"travel\") would be limited to one location at a time. (Fisherman's Dock [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Fisherman] from The Battle of Lake-Town would not, because that card specifically says \"There are now two active locations\", which overrides the travel rule.)\n\n \nSo in the absence of something like Fisherman's Dock that explicitly allows two active locations, I'd say that Strider's Path and Ghân-buri-Ghân will be unable to work if the current active location is immune to player card effects. In order for them to work, you must be able to return the active location to the staging area, otherwise you end up having traveled to two locations at once, which is forbidden. If you can't return the active location to the staging area, the one you're trying to travel to \"bounces\" off of it and lands back in the staging area again. FAQ section 1.34 applies to Fisherman's Dock because it explicitly creates two active locations, but nothing else in the rules allows for two active locations. In fact, the way the rules put it is \"Players cannot travel to a new location if another location card is active; the players must explore the active location before traveling elsewhere.\" (Emphasis in original).\n \nSo I'm firmly convinced that, absent an official ruling to the contrary, the right way to play this situation is that if the active location is immune to player card effects, Strider's Path doesn't work at all.\n \nUPDATE: However, there's been an official ruling from Caleb on a similar interaction (Dreadful Gap vs. East-Gate in Khazad-dûm). See below; the summary is that if the current active location is immune to player card effects, Strider's Path would work after all, and would create a second active location. So this post of mine has turned out to be wrong.\nEdited September 5, 2016 by rmunn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229251-striders-path-and-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=2399079","commentId":2399079,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1472999779,"content":"Si I stand corrected!\n\nThanks for the clarification, friends.. and should always remember the rule of thumb for lotr lcg : ''if it screws up the player, than it's probably the way to go.''  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229251-striders-path-and-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=2399992","commentId":2399992,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1473070092,"content":"I remember an official answer where Carrock isn't move, so there are 2 active locations..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229251-striders-path-and-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=2400191","commentId":2400191,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1473084775,"content":"> I remember an official answer where Carrock isn't move, so there are 2 active locations...\n\n \n\nYou might be thinking of this one: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1208506/rules-questions-pit-encounter [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1208506/rules-questions-pit-encounter]\n\n \n\nThat interaction was between East-Gate (\"Immune to card effects\" -- not just player card effects, ALL card effects) and Dreadful Gap (\"When Revealed: Immediately travel to Dreadful Gap.

So, yes, you will end up with two active locations.\n\n \n\nThe text involved here is very much the same as Strider's Path / The Carrock (or any other immune location), and so the ruling would apply too.\n\n \n\nSo it turns out that I was wrong: by official Caleb ruling, if Carrock (or another immune location) is the active location, playing Strider's Path is still legal, and makes you end up with two active locations."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229251-striders-path-and-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=2400232","commentId":2400232,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1473087736,"content":"yes, thanks for finding it up!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229251-striders-path-and-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=2400345","commentId":2400345,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1473092265,"content":"Wow, I did not expect that to be the resolution.
