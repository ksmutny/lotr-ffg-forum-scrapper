Doomed keyword never comes out naturally from the encounter deck outside of the quest phase, so if you want to utilize his printed ability, you'll need either luck or a doomed card played after he commits to the quest. \n\nDoomed player cards to this day are: Give all 1 resource per hero, give all 2 cards, give all the feint and take a condition from all... oh and this little fetchy thingy. 3 out of five best played before the quest phase, so it's actually pretty hard, so, unless the deck is doomy and you're in luck - his printed ability is going to be wasted most of the times. And even when it doesn't - 1 willpower is not that much to boot, unless boosted by some side effect.\n\n \n\nAs for his main purpose, defending, he is semi-good. He'll probably sustain a punch or even two, but in the current reality with 214124 attack enemies, it'll be a miracle if he'll survive his first defense. \n\n \n\nI can see a decent combo, where he defends lesser enemy, somebody uses Wizard Voice and then he defends a second time, probably to his demise, but still.\n\n \n\nWhat I hope is that Isengard trait gets developed in this cycle and there will be something to help the fellow out, but we already had 5 previews and not a single isengard-supporting card was spoiled, so the hope is slowly fading...\n\n \n\n \n\nAlso, two main competitors of him are Pelargir Ship Captain and Guardian of the Citadel. Their main advantage over him is Gondor, being able to turn them into cheap 2-willpower, 2-attack beast, given the circumstances. And Cap can even arrange some resource transportation, if need arrives. They won't stand even a slight chance in defense, like Orthanc Guard does, but I'm comparing cost to effectiveness here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105710-lets-try-to-justify-a-card-orthanc-guard/?do=findComment&comment=1075859","commentId":1075859,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1399486145,"content":"Spare Hood and Cloak !\n\n \n\nWell... it's something ^^"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105710-lets-try-to-justify-a-card-orthanc-guard/?do=findComment&comment=1075882","commentId":1075882,"userName":"Glowwyrm","timestamp":1399487257,"content":"Here's my list of uses for him:\n\nSpare Hood and Cloak is good. \n\nYou could also exhaust him for A Very Good Tale in the planning phase, play a doomed card, then ready him to quest.  \n\nHe also combos well with Grima if you're going to use Grima's ability to play an event after characters commit to the quest. \n\nHe's not a bad body on the table for Sword that was Broken or Faramir if you're flooding the table with cheap allies. \n\nHe's a solid Siege quester.\n\nI also found him to be a helpful defender for the smaller Dunland enemies in Fords of the Isen (and presumably other scenarios). \n\nThat's about it.  He not useless, but more Isengard synergy would be good and I'm hoping we get some more Isengard stuff in this cycle. \n\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105710-lets-try-to-justify-a-card-orthanc-guard/?do=findComment&comment=1076063","commentId":1076063,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1399495643,"content":"He looks cool."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105710-lets-try-to-justify-a-card-orthanc-guard/?do=findComment&comment=1076259","commentId":1076259,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1399503275,"content":"We clearly will be getting more Isenguard support at some point.

No leadership ally has more than defence 2, and the other cards that have deference 2 all have cost 4 or 5. (The Dunidain character with secrecy is clearly better in a secrecy deck - since he also then is cost 2).\n\nSo in terms of wanting a chump blocker that might survive some attacks he's pretty good to be honest, even without the ability to ready - the ready ability allows him to occasionally be able to quest and be available to defend.\n\nAlso if we ever get a low damage enemy card with doom he would be perfect to quest vs that enemy. I think that as I mainly play trait decks rather than just sphere's I probably wouldn't use him that much as I prefer to stick to a theme (Gondor, Hobbit).\n\nHowever I would certainly consider him if I needed a cheap ally that could defend and didn't have tactics.\n\nEdited May 8, 2014 by Rapier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105710-lets-try-to-justify-a-card-orthanc-guard/?do=findComment&comment=1077181","commentId":1077181,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1399560748,"content":">  \n> \n> > My infamous logic concludes that your entire post is nonsese if you finish it with words that you do not care, because posting a post is a sign of caring in the first place.
