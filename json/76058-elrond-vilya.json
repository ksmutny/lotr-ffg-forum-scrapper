My understanding is that Elrond can summon allies of any sphere, with or without Vilya, and that Vilya gives him access to the Spirit sphere. But Tactics and Leadership events and attachments?\n\n \n\nEDIT: Ah, clarification: Vilya's special ability does not require a resource match. So with this, you can play Leadership and Tactics cards from the deck if you know they are coming.\n\nEdited July 21, 2013 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76058-elrond-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=828737","commentId":828737,"userName":"Morithain","timestamp":1375372361,"content":"Yea, playing His Royal Brokenness, Lord Elrond, the best strategy I've found is to get Vilya on the board ASAP.  He becomes a quest-crusher at that point.  It's pretty sweet."}]}
