What combination of ally and hero cards will you use though? Hobbit heroes and allies for the rest? The fighting heroes and hobbit allies? Only Aragorn and Frodo don't have allies yet and both of them swap out so you'll need one of them each alternating."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296523-concerning-hobbits/?do=findComment&comment=3724077","commentId":3724077,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1560969446,"content":"> 1 hour ago, stimpaksam said:\n> \n> When you're playing solo you start with two objective allies in the quests The Temple of the Deceived and The Drowned Ruins.

And you don't even have to flip it back as the heroes don't leave the game :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nThe Hobbits easily steal the shop in this article. Pippin is a two willpower TACTICS ally with two hitpoints that is always ready to attack when he has an attack value great than zero. For the low cost of two ressources. Insane! Really an Arwen level of an ally. I dig the artwork too.\nAbout the sameÂ goes for Merry. Two willpower isn't so unheard of in leadership, but two willpower with two hitpoints for onl two ressources will always be awesome. And he makes this big quests pushes to advance or win much easier. ust combine him with Faramir :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]Â (no not the new lore verison, as Faramir seems to be doomed to never outclass his core-set form)\nFrodos artwork is a little bit generic for me as this could be about any Hobbit on a pony. But he has a great effect. For one ressources (most leadership decks will have one to spare eventually) you get threat reduction (if it weren't for doomed you couldn't even loose the game this way) AND action advantage.\n\nDeck-building wise this expansion seems to be nuts :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296523-concerning-hobbits/?do=findComment&comment=3724101","commentId":3724101,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1560970792,"content":"> 20 minutes ago, Calvadur said:\n> \n> Desperateï»¿ Alliance could be really useful if you don't find the last one or two allies to reach the cap and and the other players \"borrow\" you a hero to fulfil the contract.

Discard some heroes, replace them with allies and when you have reached 9 characters, use Fortune or Fate or Houses of Healing to bring your hero back."}]}
