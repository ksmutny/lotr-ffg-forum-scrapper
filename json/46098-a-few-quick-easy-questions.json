From my experience, they take about 30, 45, and 60 minutes with respect to difficulty. That's if you make it the whole way through though!\n\n \n\n2) My play area is usually about 18x24 inches, but you could probably have it a little smaller. Basically the only set up time ishuffling the two decks.\n\n \n\n3) This box is basically chock full, IMO. For me, I bought two Core Sets, and all the cards from both fit in the tray in the middle. I put my counters etc, under one half of the tray, and my extra sleeves under the other. Essentially, I'm saying that everything fits neatly into the 12x12 box.\n\n \n\nHope that helps!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46098-a-few-quick-easy-questions/?do=findComment&comment=461930","commentId":461930,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1304267375,"content":"hi,\n\n \n\n1. as has been said depends on quest and how far through you get, but time goes pretty quick and it should with a good game\n\n \n\n2. i play solo and once all the initial sorting of the cards/ shuffling is done its pretty quick to set up and i dont need to change where im sitting to reach the card areas\n\n \n\n3. the box is pretty full, i mean theres a hell of a lot of cards in there, and plenty of tokens, also the two threat trackers\n\n \n\nthis is my first LCG and im not dissapointed"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46098-a-few-quick-easy-questions/?do=findComment&comment=461962","commentId":461962,"userName":"Berf","timestamp":1304272174,"content":"Thanks for your answers.\n\nThis game surely generates a lot of buzz!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46098-a-few-quick-easy-questions/?do=findComment&comment=461969","commentId":461969,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1304272472,"content":"Berf said:\n\nThanks for your answers.\n\nThis game surely generates a lot of buzz!\n\n\n\n \n\nAnything Lord of the Rings tends to do that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46098-a-few-quick-easy-questions/?do=findComment&comment=462199","commentId":462199,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1304321978,"content":"conykchameleon said:\n\n \n\n1) There are three quests in the Core Set.

Scenario 3 can be lost during setup: If the wrong hero ends up being the prisoner, you're doomed.\n\n \n\nAnyway, once you memorized the rules, the game rarely takes longer than 30 minutes, no matter which scenario you use."}]}
