Ability is spend 1 resource to remove a shadow attachment. He costs 7 fate to get in the first quest.\n\n \n\nKeep in mind at 39 threat on  that quest your allies are forcibly removed so either summon him ASAP or wait till after that happens as a free action to gain an ally.\n\n \n\nShadow attachments are ones the encounter deck gives the minions to buff them, or debuff your characters. (Not sure debuffs are in the game yet, but I thought I saw a slot for them on the characters.)\n\n \n\n*All numbers are pulled from my faulty memory so hopefully they are accurate."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282007-gloin-in-digital/?do=findComment&comment=3460118","commentId":3460118,"userName":"Veve7","timestamp":1536088175,"content":"Thank you!
