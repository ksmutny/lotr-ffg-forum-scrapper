I engege him (resolve archery on legolas) and defend his attack with glorfindel (ready because of light of valinor), no shadow, so 2 damages. Legolas and Hama kill the southron and legolas and blade of gondolin place 3 progress tokens on the library...so I have 1 osgiliath location and there aren't any other in play.........my first thought was...WOW...my second was.....MEEH...\n\nEdited September 3, 2013 by DevastazioneH88"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89706-first-attempt-at-assault-on-osgiliathunpredictable-result/?do=findComment&comment=856567","commentId":856567,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1378210787,"content":"this is a common thing with this quest- you can make it very easy for yourself, or very hard depending on choices. there is a thread somewhere of how you can win with boromir without a deck by choosing the location you can exhaust a hero to place 1 progress on\n\n \n\nof course i think what this quest is designed to do is give variability in difficulty....like choosing on a computer game you can alter to your needs.\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89706-first-attempt-at-assault-on-osgiliathunpredictable-result/?do=findComment&comment=856602","commentId":856602,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1378214825,"content":"> this is a common thing with this quest- you can make it very easy for yourself, or very hard depending on choices. there is a thread somewhere of how you can win with boromir without a deck by choosing the location you can exhaust a hero to place 1 progress on\n> \n>  \n> \n> of course i think what this quest is designed to do is give variability in difficulty....like choosing on a computer game you can alter to your needs.\n> \n> rich\n\nIm sorry but i solo mode this quest is too easy. Choosing different locations snd enemy in the begin make it a bit longer not more difficult in my opinion.\n\nBut in coop this quest is very difficult and cool"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89706-first-attempt-at-assault-on-osgiliathunpredictable-result/?do=findComment&comment=856612","commentId":856612,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1378215997,"content":"i have won it both and probably agree with you on that one glaurung. check out my thread related to choosing locations- i think you probably have a lot to say on it ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89706-first-attempt-at-assault-on-osgiliathunpredictable-result/?do=findComment&comment=858039","commentId":858039,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1378346217,"content":"> check out my thread related to choosing locations\n\nMind showing that thread to me?
