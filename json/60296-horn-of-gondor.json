Play it in conjunction with a Rohan deck and let the good times roll. Horn of Gondor really gets exponentially better in multi-player games."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60296-horn-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=593120","commentId":593120,"userName":"Morbid666","timestamp":1328984783,"content":"@starhawk77-I totally agree.

Though pretty hard to pull off due to having to have 3 sneak in hand and a gandalf.. so that is a 4 draw to get the combo engine running.. oh wait a 5 draw as you need horn as well... no wonder I haven't seen this.\n\nThis game needs more dig effects gandalf's search (but better) and Gildor b4 combos like this can really get off the ground as a planned strategy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60296-horn-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=593691","commentId":593691,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1329118788,"content":"While the Horn is great for big multi-player games, I think it is overrated for single player.  You have to lose at least three allies before it even begins to pay off, and you would often be better off with another ally or attachment in its stead."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60296-horn-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=595213","commentId":595213,"userName":"Bonus Card","timestamp":1329435916,"content":"The horn is not so bad even for single player.
