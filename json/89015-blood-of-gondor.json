Blood of Gondor is a pretty quick quest, in my experience, with only two quest stages. The main mechanic is \"hidden cards\" where cards from the encounter deck are placed in front of each player. Certain effects on the quest cards and encounter cards will make you flip over the hidden cards at certain points. If they are enemies, they immediately engage with you, but if they are locations or treacheries, then they are discarded. The quest simulates a big ambush, and thus most of the quest focuses on fast and furious fighting. It is not too difficult a quest as long as you bring combat capable decks to the table. It's not a bad quest by any means, but I have a feeling over the long term it'll be overshadowed by the other AtS quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89015-blood-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=847628","commentId":847628,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1377199992,"content":"Thanks Raven.  Did you play it solo or multi?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89015-blood-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=847683","commentId":847683,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1377202887,"content":"One thing that I will add is that it had some ally-hate, so I had a much better time of it with strong heroes combined with readying effects, rather than the typical \"army of allies\" strategy. Because of chaining shadow effects, A Burning Brand or Hasty Stroke are also recommended. Orc Ambusher, in particular is an interesting enemy: engagement threshold 10, 3 attack, 1 defense, 3 hit points. He has a forced effect that causes you to discard a non-objective ally after he engages, so you either need to spike him in the staging area, run light on allies (as I did), or have plenty of cannon fodder. The hidden mechanic can also lead to some lopsided games as you can get unlucky and suddenly have a mob of enemies engaging, all with chaining shadows, or smile as a bunch of nasty treacheries and locations are harmlessly discarded.

But I would agree it is sort of difficult, so if that is the only measurement of quality for some, then I think it is surely more difficult than Amon Din. Forest and Osgiliath are harder in general, I would say, but you can get lucky; though luck is in a way the greatest factor in the Fear (for which I quite dislike it), solo the first underworld card (hidden below the Fourth Star) will often determine the outcome; the interesting factor about it is that it can later get nasty with the Plot and Villan combining strength, but then again it is much about chance there.\n\n \n\nThe Forest scales terribly with more players, hard to believe how badly.\n\n \n\nAmon Din has beautiful locations. Osgiliath also. I think it is that one that is best, can be very hard (which is so needed for some players) and has interesting mechanics without being overly complicated - having so many different decks is really annoying in the Steward's Fear.\n\nEdited August 24, 2013 by Ana"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89015-blood-of-gondor/?do=findComment&comment=848920","commentId":848920,"userName":"Ithilien Ranger","timestamp":1377331027,"content":"My ranking for solo games would be:\n\n \n\n1.
