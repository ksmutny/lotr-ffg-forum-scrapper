Not a big deal if you have a good understanding of all the cards and spheres and how they all fit together but it's not ideal if your still learning. I would start constructing your own decks before you trying to play two-handed. Maybe if you're having trouble stick with the 40-card limit for a while but I wouldn't two-hand until your very confident on the structure of the game as well as how all your cards work and interact with eachother. \n\n \n\nIf you are looking for a place to start deck-building with a minimal cardpool, I like Leadership/Spirit. I don't know what cards you have access to but there's a lot of synergy right out of Core between Aragorn, Eowyn and Theodred (Celbrian Stone giving Aragorn a Spirit icon and Eowyn's Ability+Stand and Fight+Steward of Gondor jumps to mind with just Core cards). \n\n \n\nAnd yeah--everyone's right. Don't expect to solo Dol Guldur any time soon. That's difficult even if you use the entire current cardpool. \n\n \n\nI'm glad your having fun with the game. If you have any questions swing by and ask--and update us later on how you do with the other decks and Journey Down the Anduin :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2027082","commentId":2027082,"userName":"rdw5150","timestamp":1454380679,"content":"Thanks Jon..........\n\n \n\nI am  using the Lore deck now and got my ass kicked the first time.  That starting threat hurt.I do like the card drawing and healing ability of the deck. \n\n \n\nTime to try again. \n\n \n\nAs far as what cards I have, well, I went a little nuts and have a lot of the releases (**** rum and internet stores :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]:blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png] )   Though I had planned on trying to beat the first three quests with the cards in the core set (I did augment those with some e-bay cards).  Then adding all the Mirkwood cards and hitting those 6.\n\n \n\nPeace\n\n \n\nRoger"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2027268","commentId":2027268,"userName":"JohnGarrison1870","timestamp":1454391161,"content":"Hey Roger, glad you're enjoying it despite getting slapped around a bit!\n\n \n\nSorry if this is below you, but I might as well put it here for anyone else who it might help:\n\n \n\nI believe the designers created the core set and its quests with the following development/training for new players in mind:\n\n \n\n 1. The first quest is straightforward in design, and not too difficult. Players are encouraged to just use the pre-designed 30-card single-sphere decks. The purpose is to just learn the rules, get used to the flow of the game, and start to learn the various strengths and weaknesses of the different spheres.\n 2. The second quest is more difficult, and will likely require specific deck design choices in order to have a good chance of winning. This provides an opportunity for players to start experimenting with combining spheres, and crafting a deck with more particular effects and events in mind (how will I deal with the specific challenges I know are coming).\n 3. Finally, the third quest is intentionally interesting and unique in its design (trapped hero mechanic, different areas with different quest card rules, etc.) in order to both let the player know that some wild variety in quest design is possible (so they can be curious about buying more quests) and the very high difficulty will also encourage players to start gathering expansions so they can expand their card pool and better face the challenges ahead.\n\n \n\nSo, I would recommend trying your hand at creating some 2-sphere decks from the core set in order to take on the Anduin quest, before you dive too deeply into the cycle proper."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2027321","commentId":2027321,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1454397030,"content":"Yes, certainly some warm feelings opening the box all those years (almost 5! back).

Out of all the Core starter decks I think it has the highest number of “under-powered” cards (though there are definitely some gems).

Great stat line but painful threat cost and unless you build in Spirit (not a bad idea) you don’t have access to Unexpected Courage to stand him up so he can Quest and Attack.

You can make good mono-sphere decks but they are usually so focused that they will struggle in some aspect of the game. That’s fine in multi-player where, say, a Mono-Spirit deck can do all the Questing and cancellation and a Mono-Tactics deck can take on the enemies, but in solo it’s a struggle. Personally I think you have to go a fair way into the cardpool (probably Against the Shadow, at least) before mono-solo becomes really viable.\n\n \n\nMy advice—have fun. Build some decks when you feel ready (you will probably have to for Journey Down the Anduin). And don’t get too hung up if you can’t beat Dol Guldur—we’ve all been there.

My advice is start with the most well-rounded deck you’re comfortable with after Core and see what happens. The first AP will expand a bit on Objectives, then you’ll learn tactics for dealing with Big Bad enemies in the second AP, “this is why you should always be afraid of Treacheries” in the third, how to deal with location lock in the fourth, etc, etc, etc…by the end you should have a pretty decent all-purpose deck. Personally, I then re-ran through the Mirkwood APs and it was very satisfying to see all that hard deck-construction pay off as I put the lessons I learned into practice. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2028358","commentId":2028358,"userName":"JonofPDX","timestamp":1454436640,"content":"> Yes, certainly some warm feelings opening the box all those years (almost 5! back).

And Favor of the Lady's in Core as well. Plus you're figuring UC is going on Beravor for the draw and you'll need resources to play those cards.\n\n \n\nAnd remember, you'll be questing with Eowyn every turn and probably tossing a good number of cards for that so piling up resources on Eowyn to Stand and Fight allies is great. And once you get Steward out you can start using him to attack and defend if you don't need the extra willpower. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2029222","commentId":2029222,"userName":"Greymere","timestamp":1454458085,"content":"Using just a Core set with only one sphere is a pretty significant handicap, Spirit and Lore really lack for good attack options outside of Gandalf.  Tactics suffers for questing.  Leadership performs moderately well if you can manage to reduce your threat early enough with a Gandalf/Sneak Attack since it had good resource generation decent questing and the ability to ready Aragorn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2030210","commentId":2030210,"userName":"rdw5150","timestamp":1454507682,"content":"> Yeah—that Lore starter deck can be a tough one to crack.

Pushing through the quest as quick as possible and keeping your threat low (while sniping some enemies with Dunhere) is probably your best bet. Remember Eowyn's ability--1 extra willpower might not seem like much but it adds up. And if you can ditch an ally while you have Stand and Fight in your hand, you can still bring them back onto the board later. Unexpected Courage is one of the best cards in the game but in the Core Spirit deck it doesn't have any super fantastic targets...Eleanor's probably your best bet. \n\n \n\nHope you have fun and let us know how you do. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2043038","commentId":2043038,"userName":"rdw5150","timestamp":1455071973,"content":"The only reason I will use Spirit is to see how the deck plays out. \n\n \n\nI think I will do a leadership/lore or leadership/spirit deck first.\n\n \n\nThough the combat of tactics seems cool too.\n\n \n\nLike everyone has said, great game.  I can see where you would need to use all spheres at certain times....\n\n \n\nPeace\n\n \n\nRoger"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2045043","commentId":2045043,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1455138299,"content":"> The only reason I will use Spirit is to see how the deck plays out. \n> \n>  \n> \n> I think I will do a leadership/lore or leadership/spirit deck first.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Though the combat of tactics seems cool too.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Like everyone has said, great game.  I can see where you would need to use all spheres at certain times....\n> \n>  \n> \n> Peace\n> \n>  \n> \n> Roger\n\nYou are right about needing all spheres.

Not only did it make it more managable for me, but also pushed me to try some cards i may not otherwise have tried. Also, sometimes the card pack had some synergy with the included quest, so i liked that better too.\n\nFor me, i prefered the Mirkwood cycle to Dwarrowdelf that I just finished.

For a normal player, there's waste in even a single additional Core and it gets ridiculous with three Cores. I understand why they couldn't do a full playset of cards in the Core but they should have stuck to Singles so that we could buy 3 without waste...\n\n \n\nFor you, as you want to run multiple cardpools so you don't have to break down decks, it does make a little more sense to have multiple Cores...but I still think just breaking down decks or using a different sphere would be a better option. Still, there are benefits to be had and an extra Steward, Sneak Attack, Unexpected Courage or Northern Tracker are all very nice so if money isn't an issue..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201098-newbie-wins-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=2077852","commentId":2077852,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1456789773,"content":"I struggle to justify a third core but one day would like the full playset.\n\nThing is, the core x1 cards cost about £20 posted from eBay yet a full core Inc free postage is £25 so the x1 set isnt worth it you might as well get a full core with uggins of spares.\n\nI already have so many spares from my second core.\n\nFull playset be nice though."}]}
