But I think the real problem with saga expansions and campaign mode is their incompability with the other scenarios. If we had the old forest/barrow downs as a POD or as a regular pack AND we could also make them compatible with the saga expansions and play them as part of the campaign it would be awesome, but I don't think this will be possible.\n\n \n\nI have a question regarding An Evil Wound. In the preview they say that we will face the same pressure as Frodo did to put on the Ring at Weathertop, but that we're not bound to make the same mistakes if we can. However An Evil Wound is put on the ringbearer on setup to represent the Witch king's stab. So, it appears that in the end it doesn't matter if we're amazing players and play perfectly to avoid the risks of the Ring if Frodo still has to get stabbed no matter what? That kinda sucks. It should have been a burden card so we actually have the option of saving him from the stab."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=833001","commentId":833001,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1375837446,"content":"If he doesnt get stabbed than what would you have made the 3rd and final quest?  the whole thing kind of loses its point otherwise.  If the ring is used at weather top we probably will get a burden or some other harmful effect but having him avoid the stab altogether removes the context and importance of that final quest"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=833165","commentId":833165,"userName":"asfaloth","timestamp":1375858002,"content":">  \n> \n> > From these three adventures it appears that Tom & Goldberry have not found a home in the game.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Gildor Inglorion was met in the Old Forrest and he still made it into the game.

(I felt that each book could have supported 3 saga expansions to make a total of 9, instead of only 2).\n\nIt's not because I don't like what they've done, it's because with only limited core content (relative to the length of time I hope this game goes on for) leaving bits out seems bad.\n\nof course they could always release extra saga expansions in the future that fills in missing quests. (by making it an additional saga expansion it can still be designed to work with Frodo). So not getting it now doesn't mean never getting it - I hope they do the same thing with the missing Hobbit quest sections. (Thandril's realm for instance).\n\n \n\nI do hope we don't get 6 versions of Frodo as a saga hero (I felt like getting 2 copies of saga bilbo was a bit wasteful - although the second one fixed one of my issues with the treasure system). It depends if FFG try to claim that the saga expansions are all stand alone (When obviously they should design them instead to be sequential and expect people to play them in order). The hobbit boxes were designed to be stand alone - but it isn't really. I doubt that anyone bought the second saga box without owning or intending to own the first as well.\n\nWith the boons and burdens I feel like they really need to just flat out state that the sagas are designed to work in order, and that the experience of later saga expansions without the early parts won't be as good.

We'd get a really cool character to be a hero, and really go with the lore. Or what do you think?\n\n\n\nI really doubt they will create a separate faction for him, since we already have a separate ring-sphere for the Black Riders, and I anticipate that they will keep that faction going throughout the entire Ring-cycle sagas (FoTR, TTT, and RoTK). To create a 2nd separate sphere for Bombadil would simply be ponderous for the game.\n\nI could definitely see him as an ally, and it would seem to be a fitting spot for him based on his roles in the book. I agree that it would be hard to accurately recreate him and his \"power\" (undefined as Tolkein left that) in the game, but since he never directly engaged in combat in the books (and seemed to actively avoid it), my thoughts is that he should have a very potent non-combat ability, with no actual ability to directly engage or contribute to combat. Much like The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game, he should be invincible, but with no ability to be damaged or contribute damage. That part is easy enough to do, but what about will-power? He should have a high amount of willpower as well, but not so much that he instantly lets you beat every quest site by himself.... THAT's the hard part of how to convey him to me. Perhaps they could convey his strengths and abilities by either giving him an amazing attack/defense but with a text line that prevents him from attacking/defending, like so:\n\nTom Bombadil (unique neutral ally), cost - 6\n\nWillpower - 20\n\nAttack - 20\n\nDefense - 20\n\nHealth - 1,000,000,000\n\nLimit 1 copy of Tom Bombadil per deck.\n\nTom Bombadil cannot attack or defend. While he is in play, no enemies may engage any player, and his willpower is reduced by X for every enemy in play, where X is the number of players in the game (X can never be lower than 2). If Tom Bombadil's willpower is ever reduced to 0, remove him from the game. Whenever Tom Bombadil quests, reveal 1 additional card from the enocunter deck.\n\nI wasn't sure how much of a cost to put on a card like that, but really, that ability is good enough that he probably be the first 10-cost ally in the game. I had to add that last \"add encounter\" line to keep him from being a giant permanent escape card. Especially for a solo player, and any sort of sniper deck (aka Legolas/ranged/Yeow Bow/HOTB/etc/Dunhere), that could just keep enough enemies offf the board to keep Tom's ability indefinitely.\n\nLooking at it again, I'm not sure I really like that build. I had to add that last \"add encounter\" line to keep him from being a giant permanent escape card. His stat points are useless, and they just sit there as an acknowledgment of their usefulness. So now I'm trying to find a way to represent his powerful stats and NOT have them be useless (and in the process, not have him be a giant escape card that just sits there), as well as represent some of his power in the form of options to the players:\n\nTom Bombadil (unique nuetral ally), cost - 6\n\nWillpower - X\n\nAttack - X\n\nDefense - X\n\nHealth - ∞\n\nTom Bombadil cannot attack or defend. X is the number of players in the game.\n\nAction: Any player may pay 1 resource to raise X +1 (X may never be lower than 2) for the remainder of this round.\n\nAction: Discard Tom Bombadil to return X number of enemies engaged with any number of players back to the staging area.\n\nAction: Exahaust then Discard Tom Bombadil to deal X amount of damage divided among any number of enemies in play.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI think I like this version of him much better.  Very powerful, but VERY costly in terms of playing him, and also in terms of then using him.\n\nEdited August 8, 2013 by benhanses"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=834664","commentId":834664,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1376004684,"content":"As much as it pains me to refer to anything of Tolkien's as \"unimportant\", Tom Bombadil is about as close as it gets for me.

We haven't had any non people heroes so I don't think they would do that at this point? Also, don't think Gollum would be a hero at all as he's more a mixed bag, isn't he?

It makes sense because he single-handedly slew Bolg in the Battle of Five Armies so definitely plays a major part in the story. I'm not so sure about seeing Gollum as a hero, that kinda blurs the lines of what it would mean to be a hero. In terms of the story, Gollum is always an antagonist. Even when he is ingratiating himself to Frodo, it is only to gain his trust so that he can lead Frodo and Sam to Shelob's Lair in Cirith Ungol. He makes a lot more sense to me as an objective, or possibly an ally (with some rather severe limitations).\n\n \n\nWhether or not they ever print characters like Treebeard or Gwaihir/Landroval as heroes is a very important design question for this game. While these characters definitely had a large impact on the stories, they exist somewhat on the periphery. They are more like agents of power that members of the fellowship (Merry and Pippin for Treebeard, Gandalf in the case of the Eagles) ask for aid. While this seems thematically to place them squarely in the ally category, one of the great things about this game is providing the means to transcend the story. In both cases, these powerful entities are voluntarily bound to a certain region (Fangorn, and the Eyrie), but they both are persuaded, by members of the fellowship, to step outside of these self-imposed boundaries, to help in the War of the Ring. What if they had chosen to do so on other occasions?\n\n \n\nWhile I can see the designers choosing to only represent \"major\" characters as heroes, I would personally really enjoy having hero cards for the more peripheral characters. Being able to create alternate narratives is one the aspects of this game (along with the deep strategy) that really appeals to me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=834771","commentId":834771,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1376023416,"content":"I also think it's worth noting that in the art for Merry, he is depicted with what is clearly a Barrow-blade, so that shows at least that FFG is aware of them and their relevance in the story.

So sorry if I retread some ground.\n\n \n\nI tend to fall on the \"Bombadil fan\" end of the scale. I actually enjoy those chapters quite a bit. On the other hand, I fully back the decision to cut that content out of the Saga Expansion. This expansion is all about the Black Riders, and I think it's important to maintain the tension of being constantly hounded by Nazgul. Suddenly cutting away to have us deal with Old Man Willow or Barrow-wights would be fun, but would interrupt the thematic flow. In book form it works (in my opinion, I know others disagree!), but in game form with only a few scenarios, I think sticking to the Black Riders theme makes total sense.\n\n \n\nBombadil will surely come into the game. I think we'll get an Old Forest or Barrow-downs themed scenario as part of a cycle or expansion at some point. It's nearly a certainty. This is where Bombadil can show up.

In my most recent re-read of LOTR, I was struck by the relative fast pace of the story, again compared to some modern works, and that's including the chapters that can be viewed as extraneous. \n\n \n\n(Of course, I have said that the long dialogue of the Council of Elrond is one of my favorite parts of the whole work, so that should give you an idea of my taste.)\n\nEdited August 9, 2013 by Raven1015"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=835185","commentId":835185,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1376063281,"content":"Maybe we'll get an Old Forest/Barrow Downs POD adventure down the road with Tom and Goldberry as Objective Allies.  I hope so at any rate.\n\nEdited August 9, 2013 by Bullroarer Took"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=835242","commentId":835242,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1376067745,"content":"i am a bit on the side of not wanting pod packs. they are good for getting content that wouldnt be able to be released normally, but something like this should be in the main packs. i can understand bombadil isnt for everyone, but anyone who has ever interacted with the tolkien fan base should know he is a fan favourite, and i hope the designers recognise that (i will be surprised if they dont as its obvious caleb and the other designers are knowledgeable about tolkien)\n\nEdited August 9, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=835290","commentId":835290,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1376070332,"content":"While I would have liked it \"In the Box\" too, I DO like POD packs.  Being able to bust out an adventure without having to scrounge around for the appropriate cards is nice.  But we digress.  I was simply saying that it might be the best we are going to get."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=835864","commentId":835864,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1376117767,"content":"> so, the nazgul didn't expect any resistance (aragorn: \"there seem to only have been 5 of the enemy. why they were not all here, i don't know;  but i don't think they expected to be resisted\") - they thought they would surprise them at weathertop - and were afraid of the fire brands that aragorn was wielding. two of the nazgul halted when frodo took out his sword but the 3rd kept moving forward and stabbed frodo.\n> \n>  \n> \n> while it's true the weapons are what merry uses at the end - the weathertop encoutner wasn't really revolving around the weapons the hobbits got at the barrowdowns.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\n \n\n> to the comments on weathertop plotline: the  reason the nazgul didnt attack further is stated that they knew the company had about a fortnight's hard travelling between them and the ford. they knew the ford was the obvious direction hence an ambush was a good plan which would have worked were it not for glorfindel...who most certainly is powerful enough to take on the nazgul\n> \n> i dont see any plot mistakes there, apart from some poor leadership choices on behalf of the witchking, who should have realised help would be near so close to rivendell\n\n \n\nHmm, I know both Dain and Rich are huge Tolkien fans, but I swear I've read it somewhere that burrow-blades did play an important factor when Witch-King decided to delay the chase for the Hobbits.\n\n \n\nI went back to the source materials and the materials publisehd by Christopher Tolkien, but found nothing to back me up.\n\nAfter wondering if I was delusional, I went to internet as my last resource and found where I must've gotten the idea Burrow-Blades were important:\n\n \n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\"'Escaping a wound that would have been as deadly to him as the Mordor-knife [sic] to Frodo (as was proved in the end), he withdrew and hid for a while, out of doubt and fear both of Aragorn and especially of Frodo.'\n\n \n\nThe excerpt says that his fear of Frodo was a combination of several factors, including Frodo's ability to resist attack at all, his use of an \"enchanted sword\" (presumably gained after overcoming a Barrow-wight), and his use of the name Elbereth, \"a name of terror to the Nazgul\" that connected Frodo to the High Elves. Realizing for the first time that this mission to find the Ring \"was one of great peril to himself\", the Witch-king fled, until \"fear of Sauron, and the forces of Sauron's will\" drove him back to the hunt. (Unfinished Tales indicates that all versions of \"The Hunt for the Ring\" were written between the publication of FotR and the completion of RotK, so this passage does reflect Tolkien's belief while writing the story.)\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nThis is from a random website I found on a google so it does not have much credibility,\n\nbut their source seems to be the The Lord of the Rings: Reader's Companion, which is still not very credible as they get some stuff wrong, but the Reader's Companion is using unpublished portion of The Hunt for the Ring as its source, so the ultimate source is the man himself.\n\n \n\nSo yeah.... that's all I have to back myself up about the burrow-blades-are-essential-part-of-plot argument I started.\n\nI guess I just really wanted to see this card game staying as close to the book as possible.\n\nMaybe if Peter Jackson's movie didin't skip The Old forest, I wouldn't be as much outspoken about LotRLCG skipping The Old Forest, feels like part of that part of the book is somehow being forgotten almost.\n\n \n\nOn the sidenote, I do suppose we could always visit Old Forest as part of Adventure Pack Cycle or Print on Demand challenge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=835941","commentId":835941,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1376132171,"content":"which reader companion is that from? i am not going to mention a name here, but there is an author that is known throughout the tolkien world for 'elaborating' tolkien factcs with their own flavour. a quick search will bring up the name.....not that i am saying you are wrong ellareth, i am just interested to see if i can get my hands on this source first hand\n\nrich\n\nEdited August 10, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=836106","commentId":836106,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1376149718,"content":"> which reader companion is that from? i am not going to mention a name here, but there is an author that is known throughout the tolkien world for 'elaborating' tolkien factcs with their own flavour. a quick search will bring up the name.....not that i am saying you are wrong ellareth, i am just interested to see if i can get my hands on this source first hand\n> \n> rich\n\n \n\nYes, I have realized that my belifs are not-well founded after I checked my source as they are based on readers companion...
