I could be mistaken here though.\n\nPersonally, I don't mind moria being payable. The dwarves are my favorite part of tolkiens work, and the reason I picked up this game in the first place is because I heard rumor that the mines of moria would be released. While it does cross paths with cannon a bit, the mines are generally unexplored by tolkien, and think it could work fairly well, as it ties players to a location that they know enough about to get excited over it, but potentially that it doesn't completely break cannon.\n\nI do see a few problems that they crossed, one being the watcher's defeat.  I'd prefer his card  to explicitly say that you scare it off, rather than kill it. While it is true, only peter jackson straight up said the watcher in the water was a giant octopus, i do think that it treads a bit close to breaking tolkien's story by allowing a defeat of it.\n\nSecond, unless we win the game by getting murdered in 4B of the final cycle mission, I see a huge problem here too. If players win this story by defeating the balrog, then that makes no sense, and I don't buy that there are two balrogs down there for gandalf to find another one with the fellowship. So, maybe we don't ever truly fight the balrog, and just have to flee from it and escape again? if thats the case, then the story ends with the players going to Elrond… and telling him about durins bane…  wouldn't he have mentioned it during the council of elrond? You know, something like \"oh yeah, about 50 years ago as a prank I send these 3 idiots down to moria and they found a  level 99 demon in there, you probably want to avoid that\".\n\nThe game does tread all over the place… I mean, you have characters of all ages working together, doing things they couldn't possibly have (Bilbo just didn't have time to go down to moria, for example)… so, with a game like this, i'm fine with minor fudges of the story, because it comes down to being fun (I like playing an adventure with bilbo in moria), but there are key elements I'd prefer not to be crossed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66334-ok-time-to-predict-the-finale-who-are-we-getting-in-shadow-and-flame%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=647974","commentId":647974,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1340375099,"content":"if they keep doing cycles so near the trilogy storyline this cannot be helped- more freedom will be gained if/when they do areas such as evendim, forochel, the grey havens, rhun and so on as these dont feature- and in the case of places such as rhun we only ever hear of aragorn going there, and he never really speaks about it- even gandalf didnt go that far (perhaps a time for the blue wizards?) so the designers can do much more without crossing boundaries\n\ninfact these are areas i really hope they do- a quick look in the appendices gives a wealth of info- i mean imagine the snowmen of forochel? and searching for the long drowned palantir there? perhaps it got washed up and the witch king has sent servants to find it and we have to race to get it before them, only for the climax for it to be lost forever (staying in line with proper lore)…..nice storyline hint hint cough cough haha"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66334-ok-time-to-predict-the-finale-who-are-we-getting-in-shadow-and-flame%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=648005","commentId":648005,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1340377512,"content":"I just have to say I really enjoyed the discussion here.
