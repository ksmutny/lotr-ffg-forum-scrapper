I love the game, and I love the efforts of the LotR LCG plugin developers.  I just with the OCTGN devs would implement save games *before* all the other features.  They could making saving subscriber-only.  As long as they have it.  Right now OCTGN is seriously crippled by its lack of a save game.  Maybe not for the kids with gobs of free time (but no money), but definitely for people like me, with jobs and kids, and who are willing to pay for software which makes the most of the little free time we have."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128909-octgn-saving-or-alternative/?do=findComment&comment=1364429","commentId":1364429,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1418330550,"content":"Have you tried just not closing the game? If you're playing solo, I wonder if it'll disconnect and stop working if you leave the game alone for a long time or if you sleep your PC. If it doesn't, then you could just leave the game running until you get back to it.\n\n \n\nI'm a programmer and I'd happily try to implement the Save functionality, but I'm a web programmer and I don't understand C#, which is the primary language it's built in. Not to mention the fact that I have about as much time to try to get this implemented as you have to play the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128909-octgn-saving-or-alternative/?do=findComment&comment=1364615","commentId":1364615,"userName":"guest455987","timestamp":1418342227,"content":"It does disconnect after a while.   I'll +1 the OP.  I *really* wish OCTGN would be able to save, and I might not have subscribed for a year if I realized you couldn't save, and will not likely renew if it still can't save when my subscription ends.\n\nThe best alternative is Card Warden, if you have an iPad.  Much clunkier to get going with, but it's a nice implementation and I do enjoy being able to play on an iPad.  I roughly split my LOTR LCG play time between OCTGN and Card Warden.\n\n \n\nI'm hoping that FFG might be developing some kind of system like Card Warden, where you can play the game on a computer or tablet using sets of cards that you subscribe to.  It wouldn't implement the game for you, so they don't need to program a zillion different card functions... but like OCTGN or Card Warden it is a platform to be able to play.\n\nEdited December 11, 2014 by Grudunza"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128909-octgn-saving-or-alternative/?do=findComment&comment=1364644","commentId":1364644,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1418344656,"content":"FFG should make a digital version of LTR LCG already for crying out loud. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128909-octgn-saving-or-alternative/?do=findComment&comment=1364645","commentId":1364645,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1418344690,"content":"Yeah, one that tracks progress through scenarios.  That would be awesome."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/128909-octgn-saving-or-alternative/?do=findComment&comment=1364717","commentId":1364717,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1418353005,"content":"Use LackeyCCG.
