That strategy also reduces the risk that I will have a prolonged battle with the Nazgul (+orc guards, + whoever I am engaged with or whoever is revealed by the encounter deck) lasting more than one round in stage 3, which could result in a failed quest if your threat climbs through the roof because of the Dungeon Torch.\n\nEdited November 27, 2014 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127887-escape-from-dol-guldur-objectives-as-shadow-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1349306","commentId":1349306,"userName":"Crabble","timestamp":1417171962,"content":"You could also use additional restricted attachments to loose these objectives.

Much safer, in my opinion.  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"}]}
