I commit characters to the quest, including Cirdan (who does not exhaust), Spirit Legolas, and two allies. Since in the rulebook it says I can take actions at any time during this event, could I exhaust Cirdan to ready the two allies I committed to the quest, THEN trigger Legolas's response and ready Cirdan, or would it be too late?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/244169-legolas-cirdan-and-narya/?do=findComment&comment=2669500","commentId":2669500,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1488850272,"content":"Nice idea, but it doesn't quite work.\n\nNarya uses an Action, but Legolas's ability is a Response to questing.\n\nSo, after you perform the framework action of committing characters you have to resolve any Forced/Response effects that trigger off that before a new action can be commenced. So, if you wait until Narya's Action, you have missed the Response window for the commit and Legolas can't trigger.\n\nBut, questing is a green box, and this might work if Cirdan and Legolas are owned by different players. It doesn't say you can take actions between different players committing.  Player 1 could commit Cirdan, and then use Narya, the Player 2 could commit Legolas and trigger his ability on the now exhausted Cirdan.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/244169-legolas-cirdan-and-narya/?do=findComment&comment=2669596","commentId":2669596,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1488853750,"content":"Ah I see, I just read the FAQ entry that talks about simultaneous committing of characters to the quest. Thanks. So to truly complete the combo, I'd need to play a Late Adventurer, right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/244169-legolas-cirdan-and-narya/?do=findComment&comment=2669715","commentId":2669715,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1488858585,"content":"Oh wait, never mind.
