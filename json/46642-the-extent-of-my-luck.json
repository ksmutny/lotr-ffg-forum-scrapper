I was playing Passage Through Mirkwood, and managed to get to Beorn's Path.

None made it past the 1B stage of the Quest due to the enemies revealed by the encounter deck. In two of the games, I had to face two Hill Trolls, two games had the Marsh Adder out (one of those being a 2 Troll game), Chieftan Ufthak appeared twice, and then all four decks had to face a Dol Guldur Beastmaster, in addition to some lower level enemies. Poor Glorfindel succumbed as the last hero standing while facing: 2 Hill Trolls, the Marsh Adder, a Beastmaster, and a King Spider. He needs bigger Forest Snares, ones that scoop up enemies by the dozen like those commercial fishing boats.\n\nMeanwhile, locations and treachery cards that could have made the journey so much easier were happily revealed for no effect as Shadow cards. I'm telling you, Banks of the Anduin is a player card disguised as an encounter card. I will happily travel along the Banks every other turn if it keeps those critters away.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46642-the-extent-of-my-luck/?do=findComment&comment=467930","commentId":467930,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1305279542,"content":"The King Spider shouldn't be in the Anduin scenario.

Remember, though, you deal all shadow cards out at once, so he's only the shadow card for one attacker per round for 3-4 rounds.\n\nAnd to OP: That can't happen. The first part of the quest setup is drawing the random encounter card. The second part is searching for the Hill Troll, if one is not already in play. So drawing a Hill Troll from the deck in setup is the best possible result, as you won't end up starting with anything else. Now, if you draw a Hill Troll during your first turn's quest phase, then you are SOL.\n\nI think a lot of the problems people are having are the result of missing rules or card text."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46642-the-extent-of-my-luck/?do=findComment&comment=468068","commentId":468068,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1305295947,"content":"Cidervampire said:\n\nGot up to 14 progress tokens and having complete control of the game and then drew the Evil Storm which killed all of my characters in one go...\n\n\n\nSometing similar happened to me in one of my attempts at the third scenario:\n\nI ignored one of the orc guards that appear every turn of the third quest stage and the Shadow Card was: Hummerhorns!\n\nIt was particularly annoying since I was _sooo_ close to winning!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46642-the-extent-of-my-luck/?do=findComment&comment=468145","commentId":468145,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1305307406,"content":"CAlexander said:\n\nThat happened to me once as well.

We were dealing shadow cards per attack. So, you're supposed to deal to all engaged (to both players) at the same time?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46642-the-extent-of-my-luck/?do=findComment&comment=468149","commentId":468149,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1305307990,"content":"Yes, every engaged enemy gets it's own shadow card at the same time.
