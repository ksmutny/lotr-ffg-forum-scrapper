However, it'd be nice if the card could actually do something.\n\nI am really excited by the Errand-rider. I am hoping Gondor shall see more cards to create and distribute wealth. Now that I think about it, it would have probably been better if Steward of Gondor was only playable on a Gondor hero instead of giving the trait. Much complaining about the \"too powerful\" would have thus be prevented. Chance for the errata there perhaps?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74793-heirs-of-numenor-release-announcement/?do=findComment&comment=728129","commentId":728129,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1353954405,"content":"One thing I noticed:\n\nWhen they're talking about Against the Shadow at the end, they say that it has to do with the massing for war on both sides if the mountains of shadow (meaning the mountains that stand between Gondor and Mordor).\n\nAre we going into Mordor in Against the Shadow!?!\n\nCrazy cool."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74793-heirs-of-numenor-release-announcement/?do=findComment&comment=728132","commentId":728132,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1353955863,"content":" Yeah, wondered about that too.
