Exactly hits the mark.\n\nI love your decks on RingsDB, by the way, and am curious if other heavyweights (Seastan, et. al.) would like to opine on this subject.\n\nClearly, there are numerous new and seasoned players of this game that are lusting for product that FFG seemingly refuses to reprint.Â  The desire of these players is real, and it's ridiculous that dedicated gamers/customers are left to wait in ignorant anticipation for updates on a horribly unreliable \"Update\" page. And to then to introduce challenging decks on this site consisting of cards that are unattainable just inflames the frustration.Â  To follow up with new product based on the original is simply unacceptable.\n\nI've been a Tolkien card gamer for many yearsÂ  (own and play MECCG since 1995) and am in love with FFG's addition to the genre.Â  To have desirable product unavailable while seeing new, similar product introduced just chaffs my...\n\nI'd love to see an honest, frank response from this company on their future plans for this game, and whether or not they can/will satisfy their current loyal customers.

(I don't need anyone going off on me for my thoughts so save any bashing you may want to do for someone more pessimistic).Â Â I feel for all the folks that want to obtain the older products - but you do have to wonder when some items have been at the printer for like a year and a half.Â \n\nOn the flip side a huge number of items are now on the boat that were not last week.Â  A lot of stuff that was probably harder(?) to reprint than other items.Â Also,aÂ lot of FFG's time has been spent on new product recently that perhaps slows down the reprint processÂ  in some way I'm not able to fathom. Not sure about that but its a thought. Hopefully its catch-up time for all the LotR reprints.Â  I have my fingers crossed for all the people that wish to pick up the older material. (And for me to continue with the game). There is some great stuff in the older releases.Â Â  Regardless of how this reads I'm thinking positive thoughts for the reprint of the older material.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289025-journeys-in-middle-earth-board-game-announced/?do=findComment&comment=3590605","commentId":3590605,"userName":"Hannibal_pjv","timestamp":1547472382,"content":"Lotr Lcg is just fine!

Setup was quite quick for how many pieces are involved, which meant we got into the action right away. And the action was very tense and fast-paced! Also, while I was skeptical of having to use the accompanying app, it really worked seamlessly and added more than I thought to the thematic mood of the game (it has music and sound effects if you want them on). The app also dramatically streamlines a lot of the tedious bookkeeping that can sometimes bog down the card game, which lets players focus on the game rather than keeping track of a million separate effects and statuses.\n\nDuring our game, it felt the whole time that we were racing against the clock to complete the mission objectives, and there was real and constant tension between eliminating the enemies on the board and making progress toward the objectives. It definitely felt like we constantly had to make tough choices and determine how best to use our very limited resources.\n\nThere were some epic moments of success -- like when Legolas one-shotted two ambushing Brigands who had Beravor pinned down, freeing her to secure the penultimate objective or when Bilbo slipped his dagger under an Orc Captain's armor for the kill to save AragornÂ -- as well as failure, such as when Legolas finally succumbed to a pack of hungry Wargs just shy of reaching the final objective.\n\nI also really like the way that mission completion is handled. It's not a strict win/lose outcome, but rather there are gradations of success -- depending on how many objectives you complete -- that affect the next mission. Thus you don't generally waste an hour or two on a mission just to fail and have to run it over again before you can proceed to the next, AND choices you make in one mission have major effects on what happens in succeeding missions.\n\nSo, all in all, a very good experience and it seems like you get a really good value for the $100 price tag. I would definitely recommend!"}]}
