It's rated at a 7, but I completed it in just a few rounds. Kept bypassing quest cards to keep the Nameless Fear's stats down until I got Blocked by Shadow, then took a risk and didn't reveal a Treachery. Then I quested with everyone and got out pretty easily. I didn't expect it to be as easy as The Seventh Level (DL3), but after struggling at the East-Gate for so many rounds in Into The Pit (DL5), I definitely expected a big fight.\n\n \n\nOr maybe I did something wrong?\n\nEdited July 27, 2013 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87271-flight-from-moria/?do=findComment&comment=824275","commentId":824275,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1374957822,"content":"it is indeed easier, especially if you use boromir with the tools\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87271-flight-from-moria/?do=findComment&comment=824361","commentId":824361,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1374965565,"content":"Well if you keep doing the discard a card and if treachery you lose card, you will soon learn that you almost always get a treachery.  I always beat the quest by getting the tools from the one quest card and then spending 4 turns to dig my way out.
