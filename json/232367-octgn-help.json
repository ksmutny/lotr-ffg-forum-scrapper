Start a game, you should be able to see and join it from the other window (failing that you should get it by clicking \"Join unlisted\"). Voila, you have two windows in the same game. Then you can either repeatedly switch between windows to control your two decks, or pick one window and then after loading your other deck and taking a mulligan if you want, right click on each of that deck's heroes, hand, deck and discard pile and take control of them. Then you'll be controlling everything from the one window - in this case however you will have to manually draw cards for the second deck by dragging them from deck to hand - CTRL+N won't do it, and CTRL+D will only affect the deck you loaded in that window. Also if you do a random discard from hand it'll always go to the discard pile of that window's deck, regardless of which hand you were discarding it from."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232367-octgn-help/?do=findComment&comment=2457684","commentId":2457684,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1476479514,"content":"I should have tried it.
