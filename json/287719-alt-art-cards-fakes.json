I can't seem to find a definitive answer upon searching the internet.\n\n \n\nAny info would be appreciated!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287719-alt-art-cards-fakes/?do=findComment&comment=3565388","commentId":3565388,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1544656731,"content":"It could have been made using the Strange Eons plugin.

After the GenCon 2014 event they change it to the \"Scroll\" design. My guess is the Aragorn ones are real but not the Faramir one.

Down here are both official heroes that I own and either pulled from a Fellowship kit, or got handed from Caleb personally. There are a lot of copies of leadership Aragorn though, but those without the scroll are the official ones. Any other hero with that font was made with Strange Eons, where they used Aragorn's layout (without scroll). Still, non-official alt arts are nice to have on the table from time to time.\n\n20181213_183031[1230].jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_12/1996384720_20181213_1830311230.thumb.jpg.9406f32735401c08d9de9c5d95028d4c.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_12/1976371247_20181213_1830311230.jpg.86aab2c6317c5ba6456eb9313f105161.jpg]"}]}
