Guess that is a bit of a given with a sphere called tactics. I'm sure other decks would not fair well if you got an enemy heavy draw (Lore springs to mind), conversely.\n\nI think in solo play a dual sphere deck will be the way to go, and mono decks (especially tactics and lore) will only see much play in multiplayer games."}]}
