And it seems quite difficult to me, sometimes a bit tedious, trying to find enough locations, and often very tricky.\n\n \n\nI thought the consensus has been this is one of the easier quests, yet, some decks that have beat Battle of the Lake-Town have lost to this one repeatedly.\n\n \n\nWhat is specific to this quest, and I applaud to the designers for it, is that it defies many of the usual strategies. The fact that enemies, often with deadly engagement effects, jump at you every corner makes many a plan go astray.\n\n \n\nAlso, unlike the majority of the newer quests, and this is indeed most extreme with Drúadan Forest, Steward's Fear seems to be perhaps more difficult solo."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88381-who-said-it-was-easy/?do=findComment&comment=838535","commentId":838535,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1376398754,"content":"I hear you lleimmoen.

(Clues can make this easier) But City street can stall you, and it seems that it takes me at least 10-14 turns every time I play this quest.  It can throw problems at rush decks, but more fighting type decks and many others without a fair amount of questing, cant make it through the long search through the city.  While all this is happening you will get a plot that will make it even worse!  The Villain in combat wise is nothing, but it can combo to a pretty bad result with the plot sometimes.  Its a pretty tough quest but I've beat it 4/6 times with Flight to the Ford deck. (never played it with something different.) I did try a 3 player game against it and we won but it wasn't easy and it wasn't hard.  You know, that in between.  The thing that made it hard was all the darn locations.  By drawing usually 4 cards per turn from the encounter deck, (due to surge) it got pretty hard "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88381-who-said-it-was-easy/?do=findComment&comment=838583","commentId":838583,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1376401684,"content":"This is one of the harder quests.

But that is the only ground I had when saying it was easier in coop. It probably isn't, it is just easier to pack a few different mechanics into two decks rather than one.\n\n \n\nIt is on average surely the longest quest. My experience it takes normally about 5 to 6 rounds to win a quest in 2-player, and probably a round or two more in solo; but this one, as said above, is almost always over 10 rounds (unless you get killed)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88381-who-said-it-was-easy/?do=findComment&comment=838677","commentId":838677,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1376406108,"content":"Playing solo I thinks it's the most difficult quest of this cycle. The few times I've played multiplayer I've cleared it without a ton of trouble, but by myself I feel I either get bogged down with locations, zealous traitor to wipe out all my allies (or most of them anyway) and the plot almost always seems to be the worst one possible for the deck I'm playing"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88381-who-said-it-was-easy/?do=findComment&comment=838742","commentId":838742,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1376410183,"content":"Well, my deck is not so ally dependent and I actually craved for locations because they appeared so rare in my run.

The plot cards are what make this quest so challenging. I think so far for solo is the biggest challenge in these cycle."}]}
