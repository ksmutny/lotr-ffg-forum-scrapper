I certainly don't like quests where you have to wait for the encounter deck to spit out the Thing You Need, but a good balance makes a good quest (such as Peril in Perlargir).\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84326-what-do-you-like-and-want-to-see-more-of-fighting-or-adventure-quests/?do=findComment&comment=798921","commentId":798921,"userName":"Cunir","timestamp":1369484643,"content":"i'm more of an adventure quest person. i like the way they seem to be bringing in new mechanics for each quest. i think that is what keeps it interesting, otherwise it would just be like playing the same game everytime, over and over, but with different pictures on the cards.\n\none mechanic which i thought was really good, which i think they should bring back, was the one in \"massing at osgiliath\". they made it so the locations were all on one river bank or the other. and you couldn't travel to some of the locations until you crossed the river bank. that was the closest they've ever got to making the locations feel like real locations in a real place, i think, instead of just random ones out of the deck. they should do more of that kind of thing.\n\none idea i had which i thought might be quite good, which is the same kind of thing, is having a location off in the distance which you are travelling towards as quickly as possible, but dont actually get there until stage 2 of the quest, or whatever. and every time a certain kind of enemy came off of the encounter deck, it would just go under the location, out of play until you reached the location -- so they'd be building up their forces. so the more time you took to get to the location, the more time the enemies had to gather their strength. it would be like marching towards a hill, and seeing the enemy army grow and grow as time went by.\n\ncome to think of it… isnt there a quest in the khazad-dum box which is a bit like that? where the enemies gather behind a gate until you break it down? i like that kind of thing. locations can sometimes be the weakest part of this game, i think. and the more they can do to make them feel like actual places that you are heading towards, the better"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84326-what-do-you-like-and-want-to-see-more-of-fighting-or-adventure-quests/?do=findComment&comment=798931","commentId":798931,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1369488543,"content":"richsabre said:\n\n \n\na lot of people really wanted to see harad or rhun, and gondor is of course a great hit. what i really want to see though i more adventure quests.\n\nthough i understand the stewards fear is a good narrative quest (no spoilers please- im still waiting for it in the post :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) and of course black rider looks to be exactly what i want\n\nrich\n\n \n\n \n\ncan you define what you mean by \"adventure\" quest? dealing with and attacking enemies seems to be the largest component of the game (location exploring is largely a dull affair) so i'm not sure what differentiates the two?\n\ndo you mean a quest where, to win, you have to kill a \"boss\" enemy versus not?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84326-what-do-you-like-and-want-to-see-more-of-fighting-or-adventure-quests/?do=findComment&comment=798955","commentId":798955,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1369493796,"content":"@ Cunir- they're good ideas- and the location you are thinking of is the East Gate….very tough in 3 player when all those enemies are added to staging and you can engage\n\n@Dain- i think what i call an 'adventure quest' is something like peril in pelargir, or redhorn gate. something where there is a strong narrative focus. now one could probably say the same of all quests….and that i think is due to the merits of great designing…however i see quests such as 'conflict at the carrock' and shadow and flame less so\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84326-what-do-you-like-and-want-to-see-more-of-fighting-or-adventure-quests/?do=findComment&comment=798973","commentId":798973,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1369497158,"content":"richsabre said:\n\n@Dain- i think what i call an 'adventure quest' is something like peril in pelargir, or redhorn gate. something where there is a strong narrative focus. now one could probably say the same of all quests….and that i think is due to the merits of great designing…however i see quests such as 'conflict at the carrock' and shadow and flame less so\n\n\n\ngotcha. my favorite quest is Journey to Rhosgoel, which I suppose is more narrative than adventure, but as a primarily Tactics player, I certainly love smashing enemies.
