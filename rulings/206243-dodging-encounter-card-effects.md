What are some examples of when you've dodged an encounter card effect and you revel in your glory?

 

I think my favorite kind of dodge is when I decide to take a risky undefended attack and the shadow effect says "Do X to defending character".

I can't find any official comments or comparable cards that don't say "until the end of X," or "at the end of X."  But, I also don't see how Saruman/Wingfoot's wording would change the fact that their effects already triggered and are lasting.  Feel free to ask Caleb if you want an official response.

There's no need.  Caldara and Boromir make it fairly clear.
