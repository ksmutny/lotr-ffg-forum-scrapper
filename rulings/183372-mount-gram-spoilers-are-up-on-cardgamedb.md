that would be ideal but at the very least it seems like the nightmare production cycle has really kicked into high gear over the last year or so; having the voice of isengard decks just released...i still feel like that expansion isnt that old (although it has been like  year n a half...but it doesnt feel like it!)  

I caught up on obtaining a lot of the nightmare sets I was missing this weekend at GenCon but still feel intimidated taking them on...its a lot of quests to try...in that same vein i'm sure its a lot of work on Caleb and Matt to A) work on current cycle B) work on saga expansions C) work on nightmare quests D) provide relatively consistent article updates E) everything else they have to do.

I can think of at least one deck that will include her without victory display shenanigans. She is a low-threat cost Lore hero with the Silvan trait and 2 willpower. For that matter, her 2 defense means that she could wield A Burning Brand. The Silvan Trackers in that archetype will ensure that any damage she takes will be healed without trouble. All of these things seem useful to me. She is by no means a marquee hero, nor should she be. As Caleb mentioned in our Gen Con interview, the FFG-created heroes *should* fall into the support role. It would not make sense for them to outshine the iconic characters from the stories. As someone who likes to experiment with different and sometimes unorthodox decks, I always like seeing low-cost heroes with useful traits. She adds to the flexibility of overall hero and deck building pools. An 8-cost hero is allowed to just slot into a deck for sphere and trait and allow the other heroes to pull most of the weight, it is the nature of the 6-8 threat cost range. The idea that every hero has to somehow be the end-all and be-all in every deck strikes me as unnecessarily narrow.

 

As for the art, that is completely a subjective discussion. I will say that the land of Middle-earth was filled with a bounty of magical elements so it feels appropriate for Elves to have a magical appearance. One perspective on the art could be that it represents the way that Hobbits might perceive a beautiful elf, upon first meeting one. In any case, to each their own. There is plenty of hero card art that I would re-examine before I would ever criticize this particular card.

> Am I the only one who is not a fan of Rossiel? I mostly mean in terms of theme.

Nope. Not a fan too. And that comes from someone who is actually kind of a fanboy about everything Matt and Caleb have done with this game, that has never felt as thematic since they're in charge.

But I really don't get the Victory Display mechanic, in terms of theme... so Rossiel all the more.

That being said, the hero review by Ian at Tales From the Cards softened a bit my opinion. Also, I've not yet read her backstory, so I might understand the theme of "elvish magic" behind it. But for now, it feels too "mechanical" for me. Hope actually playing her will change my mind!

I like the art though.

Well, that's how Caleb and Matt are handling the game, so get used to it I say. Even before them what they've been doing is just building archetypes around certain cards or groups of cards. Some archetypes are more flexible, some aren't. The silvan deck has a definite core, as probably will the Dúnedain deck as well. Leadership Gondor has core cards, Outlands, Dwarves, allies leave play, Eagles, the list goes on. Even in decks that are more general-purpose and mix and match different races there's still some kind of core. In a Tactics Boromir deck you'll probably want to include Gondorian Shield, Secret Vigil, Quick Strike, etc or in an Lore deck you'll want Daeron's Runes for example. Mono-leadership Gondor pretty much builds itself, as well as Eagles. In the end the power level of heroes and its combinations amount to certain archetypes to be built upon them, either with core cards for the spheres or for its traits, but whereas in the past these archetypes were built over time with some cards thrown here or there for them, now Caleb and Matt just cut to the chase and give all the minimum necessary pieces for an archetype right away, which I really like. But even you proved you can flexibilize with an Outlands deck, and you can include Galadriel's Handmaiden in a non-Silvan deck. The same goes for Rossiel. Yes there are some must include cards for her but not only that is the case for almost every other deck in this game, but you can also make different variations of it. My personal plan is to make a more aggresive deck around her, just get her to 4/1/4 as quickly as possible and then smash face.

 

In short, my point is, criticizing Rossiel because there are core cards that you "just throw together" in a deck with her is really unfair, as that is the case with almost any archetype in this game.

Man, where did these forums go to?

 

From my point of view John was just pointing out that the victory display strategy is developed in a way that you can just put all cards saying "x" together and you've got a deck. 

Well, in this way I would agree, but it requires a bit more nuance if you ask me.

 

I don't see a reason to fire an army of Orcs on someone with world like : "don't like it, don't play it." "that's the way how things go". That's quite the fallacy and you know it. If Caleb and Matt would say such things, the game would have died long ago.

 

Please just keep things polite and constructive. John is entitled to voice his OPINION on the victorydisplaything and Rossiel as is anyone else.

 

Anyway, Rossiel is indeed tied to the victorydisplay but as my favorite Ecthelion, namely the Third, pointed out, there is a lot of room left for cards.

Nope, I'm looking at that and thinking it's clearly an effect of the lighting.

Actually Caleb said pretty much exactly that in the GenCon Grey Company interview, talking about Outlands.

Yeah its really not the lighting.....

See where the light is hitting her shoulder and it is actually making the green lighter and there is actually a bit of a cream/white colour going on as well whereas on her chest and neck where the light is not reflected and is blocked by her head and hair it is completely green and all one shade. The only spots where she is not just completely green are her brow and shoulder both of which are bathed in light giving those spots a look of white/cream mixed in with the green. All the parts of her that do not have light shining on them are completely green. No idea how you don't see that. Just look at her neck...
