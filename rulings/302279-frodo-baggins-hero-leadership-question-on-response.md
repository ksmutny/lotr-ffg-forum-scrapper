How do I have to understand the last sentence of that card? What happens when I quest successfully, but didn't spend the resource? Will I still reduce my threat?

The card reads:

Response: After Frodo commits to a quest, spend 1 resource from his resource pool to ready another questing unique character. If you quest successfully, reduce your threat by 1.
