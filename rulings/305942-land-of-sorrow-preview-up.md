As someone whose favorite archetype is Eagles, this is a splendid set!

Wow. Just when I think I can't be more excited for a pack after Saruman/Green wanderer,Â Three Hunters, The One Ring and the awesomeness they was the last cycle; they go and one up everything.

Â 

So much to unpack here but I'll throw in my two cents.

Love that it's Gwahir as the hero and our saved Eagle as an amazing ally. Thematically Gwahir being harder to use but also incredibly powerful is very appropriate, very excited to get this bird on the table with his flock. And I'm hoping there is a Tactics crown attachement for him that let's you dig for allies or bring them back from the discard.Â 

There are some other player cards...

Now the real meat of the article, the new contract, first off what a way to dramatically increase our hero count by making everyone into heroes! This is so cool, unique and will make for so many fun combinations. Here is my favourites:

The Sons of Elrond are now in all the spheres and are actually solid choices since most enemies are orcs and they open up a lot more options for pairings of the two.

Anborn (Lore), this is what Traps needed, being able to start with the most eco-friendly man in Middle-Earth theÂ recycling Dunedain is going to make traps shine.Â 

Gamling, just when you thought Rohan wasn't going to be boosted anymore than it was, here is the second most Eco-friendly human in the lore, who can now beginÂ reviving and reusing your allies round one. Let the combos commence.

Elfhelm (Spirit), in case you don't want to raise your threat ever again, here is your guy.

Firyal, she has become the greatest solo hero in the game. Amazing Willpower, especially for Lore, and that ability that puts Core Denethor to shame, she will be the star player in this new contract.

Likewise Jubyr will also be the star of defense and can easily take the title of best defender from Beregond and Erkenbrand. Who needs Burning Brand or Inner Strength when your hero can be immune to shadow effects from round one.

Arwen, great boost to the key aspect of defending right from round one.

Gimli, excellent all-arounder who can always quest but will be ready when you need him for combat.

Legolas, similarly to how his first hero version allows tactics to quest unorthodoxily, our new Tacticts hero version will be a card drawing machine which is what Tactics sorely needed. Very excited to get this elf on the table.

Gildor,Â move aside Stargazer and Gandalf hero,Â Elrond decks have a new best friend, being able to arrange two rounds worth of Vilya targets from the top 3 cards or your hand is going to be an amazing thematic pair up. Also excellent stats for the in-between rounds or with some readying. Another excellent Elven defender and target for burning brand.

Bilbo, similarly to the above, Bilbo will very thematically make your Gandalf hero decks shine and let you use him to his full Gandalf-The-White potential from the first phase.Â 

Haldir, kind of the Gwahir light, great for multiplayer games.

Rosie, the new star of the hobbits

Skinbark or beechbone are going to be destroying enemies alongside their Ent kin. You couldÂ even make a case for Leaflock finally since he is one of the cheaper Ents to make a hero and will get his full effect very quickly most times.

Galdor, will go with pretty much any Noldor (or spirit Legolas) you have plannedÂ 

Brock iron fist......... no hahaha

Wiglaf to be the third dale hero with his excellent readying ability making him into a quasi-Boromir.

Forlong, likewise to the above, he will be a staple in Outlands decks.

Pippin,Â becomes the best low-threat questing Tactics hero in the gameÂ with a great synergistic effect

Angbor,Â is now essentially a better Aragorn

Â 

And so many other options!Â I love that this contract boosted Harad into top tier hero status, and opened the door for so many more combinations of heroes out there. Excellent work Caleb and design team! Spot on!

By gum, you're right.Â  By rule, the encounter deck exists in step 2 already.Â  Mechanically, playing a guarded attachment then should work just fine -- though it has the potential to fetch a Guard that will be put out of play during scenario setup!

When contracts were introduced we were told they would enter play during step 2, but Caleb's ruling (linked upthread) requires it to happen after step 7.Â

I totally ignore Calebâ€™s rulling. It seems to me a hasty reply, and his head is totally in the Marvel Champion lcg now ðŸ˜Š

Donâ€™t be hasty

House rule: Lindor works.

Give the poor elf some love.
