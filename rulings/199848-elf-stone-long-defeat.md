If Elf-stone is attached to active location and Long-Defeat to current quest, and... players explore all (active location and quest , advancing to the next quest card), what happens? what is first? Can you draw 2 cards by Long Defeat and after put into play one of them (if it is ally)?

This doesn't exactly answer the question, but it does clarify some of the timing issues. I'd probably play that the quest is defeated and the location is explored at the same moment.

I think this answers it.  The location clearing and quest advancing happen at the same time, but it doesn't matter as the responses ALL wait until you have a moment to resolve them.

 

You advance to the next stage, complete any forced and when revealed of the next quest stage, and then you have both responses from the quest clearing and from the location clearing waiting...

 

Then First Player chooses what order to resolve them in.

 

So I think that is pretty official.  You can choose to resolve Long Defeat first, and then use an ally drawn from it's effect with Elf Stone to put it into play.  Or the other way, and use elf stone to enter Quick Beam into play, and the Long Defeat to heal it ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

> If the active location is explored and at the same time the players make enough progress to defeat the current quest, the rules require that the players immediately advance to the next stage. This rule puts priority on resolving effects tied to the current quest before resolving effects tied to the active location. As a result, players must resolve any effects that trigger from defeating the quest before resolving any effects that trigger from exploring the active location. Therefore, The Long Defeat must be resolved before Elf-stone can be resolved.

I have figured it out.  All this stuff is Caleb's meta-strategy.  Give us rulings that create more questions than answers, and we will eventually stop asking for rulings.

> Yes, at this point, doesn't matter how many rulings get reversed.  Give us a 90 page document and we'll figure it out ourselves.

So much this...  I love this game, and it's very challenging.

 

Every time I play since I bought this game I've learned a new thing I was doing wrong.

 

However - I feel I understand the general rules well, but then we get these questions and there aren't answers... constant messages to caleb and then the answers don't always match other similar scenarios...

 

I want a consistent system, a set of rules the game plays by, and the cards need to be written by those rules.

Ahahaha ! Caleb rules :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png]

 

So if next stage have a "When revealed effect", we need to resolve the "When revealed effect" before exploring the active location ?

 

Why so complicated answer ...

Curious, i never understood why text of 'Road to Rivendell', side 2B says '... if there is no active location,'. With Caleb answer it makes sense, otherway, never can happen it (so why it writes so?)

 

Without the Caleb's answer, in Cair andros, if you explore the last Cair Andros location as active, you would jump to, for example, 5b, and you could explore it before even resolving its 'when revealed' and win the game.

Then Caleb's answer makes sense
