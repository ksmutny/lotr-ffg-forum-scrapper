I followed with some interest the various threads on bad card design, and having been giving the topic some thought of my own this month. Looking through my collection, I came to the conclusion that several cards are such staples in the game that it's almost impossible to play without them. Here are the 5 biggest offenders, from least to worst:

 

5. Unexpected Courage - While not all that bad in of itself given that there's only one copy per core set, the ability to fairly easily procure 2 more copies (there are a lot of great reasons for having at least 2 core sets beyond this one card) has created a few powerful combos, to the point that characters like Beravor had to be issued errata. Before the errata, I was drawing 4-6 cards and still either questing, attacking, and/or blocking attacks, in some combination. Beravor aside, you still get the opportunity to abuse other characters like Denethor, who can look at the top card of the encounter deck, move it to the bottom, and look again. And even when you aren't using a character that has an action ability, performing two basic functions at virtually no cost over the course of the game is incredibly powerful. When compared to other things like Steed of the Rohan, Cram, or Spare Hood and Cloak, it's just too good. Just about every other method of readying a character has a continual price attached, or is a cheap cost event.

 

4. Arwen Undomiel - A 2 cost ally with 2 WP who can tame difficult attackers by either beefing up a low defense into something manageable or by setting up the best defender with a high defense and the ability to block all over the board, this is the only ally on the list. Granted she is unique, but the card really narrows design space in deckbuilding because it's just too important to include. Anytime a deck falls apart in one game without a certain card and then sails through without a single hiccup in the next game because of that card, well that's when you know it's a problem.

 

3. A Burning Brand - The last line of the discussion on Arwen sums it up fairly well. Anytime a deck falls apart in one game without a certain card and then sails through without a single hiccup in the next game because of that card, well that's when you know it's a problem.

 

2. Protector of Lorien - I like the design aspect to it, as it is simple and useful, but at the same time it's just an auto-win card. In a recent article, Caleb said he hoped the new Isengard set would challenge the popular "turtling" approach to the game, where players sit back and collect a ton of cards as they build up to the final stage of the encounter before gliding past with ease. (I'm paraphrasing.) Protector of Lorien is the gravy of the turtling game. Even incorporating the errata to limit the discard to 3 cards per phase, how many cards do you really intend to hold onto when discarding round after round gets you through the game that much faster? The other thing to realize is that in a last-ditch effort situation, you can just play 2 Protectors and then toss six cards to wrap up in 1 turn what might have taken 3-5 or even been a losing situation.

 

And the number 1 card is...

 

1. Light of Valinor - I'm sorry, but when I think about poor card design this is the card that comes to mind. It takes the worst hero in the game and makes him the best, so much so that it's considered poor deckbuilding not to use him in a spirit-centered design. I'm going to be honest. When I started using Glorfindel, I did not put Light of Valinor in my deck. It was an intentional choice. I wanted to challenge myself to overcome the drawback of my threat continually increasing. It limited how often I committed him to quest - even when he had Unexpected Courage on him - and his role was mainly to attack enemies that I engaged over the course of the game, until I needed his 3 willpower to get me over the hump of a particular stage. These days, I do use Light, but I don't really rely on it. I'm not afraid to quest with him without that on him, either. But I've seen other people sit back and keep him vertical until they draw the attachment. To me that's the equivalent of playing Gandalf to lower your threat by 5 and then discarding him without questing or fighting an enemy. Would you play an event card that costs 5 where the text read: Action - Reduce your threat by 5. ?? Because that's essentially what you are doing. The same is true for Glorfindel. Every round he doesn't do anything is a round where you could have started with a higher threat and accomplished more. If it takes 4-6 turns longer to get to the same result, then you should have used a 9-11 cost hero.

 

Honorable mentions

Asfaloth (It's forced the designers to increase the quest points on locations and made the game more difficult for other spheres/decks that don't have access to Asfaloth);

 

Gondorian Shield (Denethor with a 6 defense and the ability to cancel shadow cards each of the 3 times he blocks thanks to Arwen, A Burning Brand, Unexpected Courage and Behind Strong Walls is just golden);

 

Gandalf, the new one (More people should use him, but don't. It costs threat to keep him in play, but he can quest and attack, and the core one is really little more than a crutch these days)

 

So that's my opinion on the subject. I am certainly not advocating the errata or banning of cards, but I think it's important to understand what these handful of cards have done to overall design, both of new player cards as well as encounter deck concepts. We got Battle and Siege because of these cards, but we didn't get anything to help Lore and Spirit spheres play in the Battle/Siege realm (unless you go mono sphere, which is just a bad idea if you are a solo player like me).

> this debate also needs to be taken into context with the whole player base. there is a large amount of the player base who still find this game very difficult- and thats with all the above cards, often with more than 1 core set...so this is ability based. what one person can do with UC and Steward is very different to what another can do

I agree, a lot of people still struggle. But most of those IMO are "theme" players who prefer to have a losing deck that mimics the storyline rather than a strategically designed build that earns victory consistently. I am not knocking people who prefer that method, just stating the perception. It's difficult to take a complaint about the challenge level seriously from someone who insists on not usi g the staple cards that are required to win.

Speaking more generally, I disagree with the sentiment that a player can just ignore the powerful player cards. The designers don't ignore them when making new encounters. Look at Caleb's comment about Isengard for proof of that.

Lastly, I didn't ignore dwarves. I don't view them as gatekeeper cards tho. I have a dwarf deck, a pretty good one according to the Internet but the deck I built on my own plays faster and stronger with a greater percentage of wins.
