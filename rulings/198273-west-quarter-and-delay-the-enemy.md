If West Quarter is the active location and Delay the Enemy is the current quest, what do we do?

> Hi Nathan,

> Great question. Assault on Osgiliath was designed long before side quests were a part of the game, and while we tried to take existing scenarios into account when we created side quests there were bound to be a few odd interactions such as the one you found. In this instance, you should treat West Quarter as if it read: “While West Quarter is the active location, the main quest gains siege.”
