Hi all,

 

today I played a 2 player game in The Hunt for Gollum Nightmare and we can into the next situation. I played Ravens of the Mountain and we found the Ravenous Hawk.

I wondered what the outcome would be. I thought the following. We engage the ravenous hawk because we looked at it because of a card effect, and afterwards he returns to the top of the encounter deck because Ravens of the Mountains explicitely states that the card goes to the top of the encounter deck. Was this play correct or not?

 

Some explanation would be nice.

There is no more explanation than that... you might want to ask Caleb if you want a definitive answer.

I asled Caleb and this is the answer :

>  
> 
> If you look at Ravenous Hawk with Ravens of the Mountain, you will put it into play. Then you will place progress on the quest equal to its threat strength, and then you will put Ravenous Hawk back on top of the encounter deck.

Simply resolve each line one by one.
