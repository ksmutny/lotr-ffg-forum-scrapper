With all aspects of "player setup," including The One Ring, moved to "Setup 7.B" it is now very possible to discard that card due to encounter card effects during Setup 6 or Setup 7.A, or by choice with Hero Galdor's Ability.  If it's in the discard pile at Setup 7.B, does it's text still apply and it's setup ability take effect?

Actually for now both the ruling and the part in the booklet could still coexist if you put The One Ring in Play in Step 2 of the Setup as per its specific rules, then resolve its effect to search for a Master card in step 7B, as per general ruling about Setup effects of player cards.

I actually tried to ask Caleb a follow up about the recent ruling about the Contracts setup as to clarify situations like this, Thurindir and so forth. Let's see...

Caleb answered me by saying that his recent ruling ovverides any past ruling about Setup effects so right now it seems basically all Setup players effects are moved to Step 7 (after the scenario Setup). I guess the odd part out might be the rules booklet from A Shadow in The East so a safe option could be to ignore the booklet and put The One Ring in play in Step 7.

Would it kill Caleb to admit that protecting Guarded cards in step two isn't worth the grief?  I mean, nearly everyone is going to use Strider anyways!

So true. I've always agreed with him about every other rule change or card errata but this...come on.

I personally house rule that player cards with Setup  effects trigger during step 2 and The Grey Wanderer should read, "Setup: Search your deck for a non-Guarded attachment with a printed cost of 1..."

I believe he also did this to make the Messenger of the King contract less OP. There are some allies like Lindir that can make for some crazy starts.

Also it's not actually needed, since in Step 2 there is already an encounter deck, so Guarded cards would still work. If they are involved I guess it's more to avoid having them pull out stuff from the encounter deck that they shouldn't.
