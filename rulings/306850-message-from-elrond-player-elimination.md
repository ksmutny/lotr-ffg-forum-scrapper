If a player plays message from elrond and passes over a card, what happens that round if the player who passed the card gets eliminated? Is the card removed from the game? If so, that is a pretty sad result. Allies and attachments cannot remain in play with this card effect then and thus you cannot make a "before I'm eliminated" pass.

I got a ruling from Caleb once about the Forced effect on a Curious Brandybuck that triggered after its owner had been eliminated, but was under another player's control. The answer was, the Brandybuck is removed from the game. Message from Elrond has similar enough wording that it should be the same with its card.
