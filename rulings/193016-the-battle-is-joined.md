They talked about this question in the most recent Cardboard of the Rings podcast too.

 

Anybody remember the ruling about damage cancellation?  Caleb wrote something like you don't put a point of damage on the character, then remove it.  You just cancel it, so from a mechanics standpoint it never happened.

 

Similarly, Quick Ear 'cancels' the enemy card.  You don't reveal it and then unreveal it.  Treat it like it never happened... which means no Wingfoot.

I don't see why not. Choose Wingfoot first and once you've satisfied the conditions for the response, use Quick Ears response. Before Quick Ears is even on the table, Wingfoot has already been satisfied. There's no take backs. That's my opinion.

 

It would be nice if we had a Stack like Magic dictating the order of things so there's less confusion about these things. Anyone tried e-mailing Caleb and Matt about this?

For reference, here is the ruling I was referring to earlier.  Perhaps my interpretation is reaching a bit.  Quick Ear says "cancel an enemy card" and not "cancel the effects of an enemy card" (since you're getting rid of the whole card and not just its effects), which is something I do not think we have seen before.  So, not sure how this would interact with Wingfoot, and whether the card is still considered to have been revealed or not.  But here is the ruling:

 

"When a player uses a Response to cancel an effect, the result is that the canceled effect never resolves. For example, when a player uses A Test of Will to cancel the ‘when revealed’ effects of The Necromancer’s Reach, the players do not deal 1 damage to each character in play and then remove 1 damage from each character in play. Instead, no damage is dealt.
Similarly, if you use the Response effect on Raven-winged Helm to cancel the damage just dealt to Erkenbrand after triggering his Response effect, you do not place 1 damage on Erkenbrand and then remove it. Instead, the damage is not dealt at all. In which case, his cost has not been paid and you cannot resolve his effect.
Visually, it looks like this:
Damage is dealt by effect ——> Response effect cancels damage dealt ——> No damage is actually dealt
Cheers,
Caleb"

Caleb has said before, and I can see this being the case, that a lot of times the way the card is written seems pretty straight-forward. So I can see how one could argue that the reason Erkenbrand and Raven-Winged helm wouldn't work can be found on the card without having to ask the designer for a ruling, but I could see the other side as well. It's tough trying to keep everything perfectly worded :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Also, I knew when I first saw the Helm that it had to be too good to be true lol.

I went ahead and submitted this question to Caleb finally.  His reply is below, followed by the question that I submitted:

 

Caleb wrote:
"When a player card, such as The Door is Closed or Quick Ears, cancels an encounter card, play should proceed as if the canceled card were never revealed. That means if you cancel a Sorcery card with The Door is Closed, Thaurdir’s ability will not trigger. It also means that if you cancel an enemy card with Quick Ears, Wingfoot cannot trigger off of that enemy. 

Cheers,
Caleb"

 

My question was:

"Hi, Recently there have been a couple of Lore events that cancel cards, and they have some differences in wording compared to other cards. I'm adding emphasis below: The Door is Closed says "After an encounter card is revealed from the encounter deck, cancel ITS EFFECTS..." Quick Ears says "Exhaust a Dúnedain or Ranger hero to CANCEL AN ENEMY CARD JUST REVEALED from the encounter deck..." What gets canceled with these? Quick Ears has you cancel the "enemy card." If you play Quick Ears, can you still trigger the Response on Wingfoot (which requires an enemy to have been revealed, if you chose enemy)? Same question for The Door is Closed. This might interact with a previous ruling about canceling damage that was "just dealt" (previously ruled that if damage is canceled you can't trigger a response that keys off of damage being dealt). How about in a case like this: in The Battle of Carn Dum, Thaurdir has some nasty effects if a Sorcery-traited treachery card is revealed. If you use The Door is Closed, will they still occur? Or if you have a Goblin Archer from Khazad-dum in the staging area (deal 1 damage when an enemy is revealed), but you use Quick Ears? Sorry for the many examples, but thank you very much for your help!"

This doesn't answer the question to my satisfaction, because both responses (Wingfoot and Quick Ears) have the same trigger. So it seems like I should be able to use the Wingfoot response to ready the hero, THEN play Quick Ears. For that matter, I should be able to respond with Wingfoot and then exhaust some other character to pay for Quick Ears (to still benefit from the enemy for purposes of Wingfoot). They are both responses to the enemy being revealed, I am just choosing to use one before the other. I understand that Quick Ears makes it so that the enemy was never revealed, but that it not relevant when resolving the Wingfoot response because it (Quick Ears) hasn't happened yet. Surely cancellation does not also perform time travel to negate a previous response which as already resolved? Response resolution in this game becomes less intuitive to me all the time. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

Just to clarify, the readying from Wingfoot is not even a response - it is actually a passive that is constantly looking for an enemy to be revealed. The response on Wingfoot is the attached character committing to a quest. This then creates a passive effect which is checking for an enemy to be revealed. The FAQ states that passive effects happen before anything else (other than forced) so it definitely seems like you could wait for this passive effect to ready your Wingfoot-ed hero and then pay the cost for Quick Ears (which is itself a response). With two effects that have the same timing, the first player has always been able to choose the order - I don't see why this should be any different.

I believe this is where you are misunderstanding.  It does indeed perform time travel so I don't know why it wouldn't negate any passive, forced effects, or responses that could have triggered as a result of the event if it were not cancelled.  This is consistent with other rulings, I think.

 

1.  If you aren't allowed to time travel, then cancelling one point of damage that was dealt to a character would not "revive" it if were to cause the character to be defeated.  They have ruled that you in effect negate the damage as if it never happened.

 

2.  If you aren't allowed to time travel, then cancelling treacheries with A Test of Will would do very little if their effect was first applied. 

 

I am sure there are a number of other examples of this as well.  However, perhaps there are examples of the opposing view point (not sure).  I do think that Caleb's ruling could cause some issues though.  Say you have a card eventually that allows you to trigger an effect when a character is dealt damage.  Let's say this effect allows you to search your deck, then shuffle, and that you already knew the top 5 cards of your deck (due to Imladris or something).  Then you play Gondorian Discipline to cancel that damage.  Well now, in order to roll everything back you have to find those same 5 cards or whatever and place them back on top of your deck to negate the first card you played.  While my example is possible to revert, I am sure there are other situations that would cause you to not know how to legally resolve the circumstance.

I really do think it is poor wording and that cancellation cards are meant to trigger before the card being revealed does anything. Unfortunately, all the cancellation cards say after it was "just revealed" making it really strange.  A Test of Will came out in the Core set before they really had a system for wording things so we could just chock it up to saying that they didn't realize the consequences of saying "just revealed" and instead meant it to resolve before it has a chance to be revealed.   Perhaps a FAQ update is in order because based on Caleb's ruling it really seems the card is supposed to be canceled before it does anything. 

 

The awkward thing is that I still see no problem with Wingfoot resolving after you cancel a treachery's When Revealed effect with A Test of Will even if we accept that A Test of Will cancels the effects of a treachery before it is revealed.  Cancelling the effects of a treachery before it reveals does not stop it from being revealed right?  It seems that it does, though if you are not allowed to trigger Wingfoot.  But we also know that it doesn't...because keywords like Doomed and Surge would still affect you even if you had cancelled the When Revealed effects and the card must be revealed for those to happen.

 

I would think the resolution would be:

 

1. Cancel the When Revealed effects of the treachery with A Test of Will (before it is actually revealed)

2. Reveal the treachery and Wingfoot readies the attached hero since you named Treachery and its passive effect comes before any Forced effects (such as keywords)

3. Apply any relevant keywords such as Doomed/Surge

 

Edit: Apparently I misread Caleb's ruling.  It seems he is only referring to the entire card being cancelled and not other cancellation effects like A Test of Will.  Let me re-read some things... :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

So it seems based on Caleb's ruling the resolution of Quick Ears / The Door is Closed! is as follows (despite the text saying after it was revealed):

 

1. Look at the top card before you reveal it

2. Cancel the effects/card with Quick Ears / The Door is Closed! before it is actually revealed

3. Never reveal it and do not trigger any such effects that would trigger off it being revealed since the card itself was discarded or shuffled back into the encounter deck

 

I suppose they really just need to release something in the FAQ that indicates that cards that cancel effects should all have the text "as it is being revealed/played" or something to that effect...

 

This solves the problems the ruling makes.  It also solves the second issue you mentioned, Seastan.  Since in the case of The Door is Closed! the card is not yet revealed, and you discard it before it is revealed.  Granted, all of this assumes we change the wording on Quick Ears, The Door is Closed, Minas Tirith Lampwright, and A Test of Will (among others I think).

 

However, this interpretation would muddy the waters a bit with Counter-Spell.  I am not sure how that would work.

 

Edit: I suppose this interpretation also causes some problems.  If you never reveal the card, then shouldn't you still have to reveal one as required by the number of players in the game...lol.  They really should let us trigger responses first.

You are misunderstanding my point. There is no need for A Test of Will to "time travel" as it cancels the effect. I am not disputing that canceling an effect is treated like the effect never happened. My point was that the timing is muddled because the passive effect from Wingfoot should apply immediately (readying the hero), but that you still have a response window to play Quick Ears. If you do then choose to play Quick Ears it seems very weird that a passive effect which has already been resolved as a side effect of the original effect would also magically "unresolve" itself (e.g. you have to exhaust the hero you just readied). I understand why Caleb is ruling it this way, because in LCGs cancelation has always been absolute - but this creates a messy set of response rules. This means that Quick Ears not only cancels the revealed enemy (which is intuitive), but it also requires you to "unwind" any passive effects which also triggered from the enemy being revealed (e.g. Thalin, Ithilien Tracker, Wingfoot, etc.), which is decidedly less intuitive.

 

I am not even saying that this is the wrong ruling - but it concerns me that this game seems to become vastly more complex with time. Just to be clear, game complexity is not a purely hypothetical or pedantic argument. When I tried modeling the game rules in software, I quickly realized just how complex this game is. Looked at another way, this complexity is a blessing as it all but guarantees that this game will only exist in physical form.

Life would be simpler if it was well.. simplified!

 

Cancelling SHOULD be what Caleb said: "behave as if it was never there in the first place".

If the cards had only been of two types:

 

a) Cards that just pretend you never saw the card. NO CARD CAN EVER TRIGGER ON THE CARD THAT GOT CANCELLED. The end. Easy to explain - you never ever even saw it!

b) Cards that cancel clearly ONLY the When Revealed effect, and everything ELSE happens.

 

Oh well.

Yes, this was something that I brought up to Caleb way back when he clarified the timing of Thalin's passive effect. It seems odd to me that an enemy could die before it has even entered play and that damage can be assigned to it while the card is still in "limbo". The thing that makes this especially problematic is that "Immune to player card effects" only applies while a card is in play - which implies that Thalin could effect such enemies revealed from the encounter deck since they are not technically in play while his passive effect is damaging them.

 

This game is starting to accumulate some rather interesting rules cruft. It's fine once you understand the errata, and is especially benefitted by efforts like Seastan's above (which absolutely should be part of the rule back). The real challenge comes when trying to explain a particular ruling to new or more casual players. I remember when I was trying to explain to Mrs. Beorn one of the timing issues with Thalin and she looked at me like I was making the rules up. Not that I can blame her, as some of these corner cases feel almost arbitrary.

I am fairly certain Caleb said the crows goes into the deck.  With that said, I am not sure if it first goes to the discard pile and then the Eastern Crows trigger shuffling themselves into the encounter deck, or if the Eastern Crows immediately shuffles into the deck without ever going into the discard pile.

 

I think what you are remembering is that Eastern Crows does not trigger Surge if is defeated by Thalin.

 

Edit: Come to think of it...isn't Eastern Crows the entire reason the developers ruled that Thalin's ability damages enemies before they do stuff like Surge?  If Thalin didn't damage the Eastern Crows before Surge, you would create an infinite loop if Eastern Crows was the last card in the encounter deck.  So this card alone, is why they ruled the way they did regarding Thalin perhaps...

If you compiled all of this into one big rules query to Caleb/Matt -- say, Seastan cleaned up and finalized his guide to revealing and asked, "Does this cover it?" -- I like to imagine the response would just be a link to a new FFG press release about LotR LCG 2.0. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I have sent FFG a question regarding Toughness and Eastern Crows game text being active or not because I feel it has such a major impact on how we play that we need to know the answer.  Depending on the answer, I will follow up and ask about Immune to Player Card Effects, and various other effects.  I hope the decision will be consistent.

In the current guide, we do have Toughness/Peril (keywords) before Don't Be Hasty.  I assume the argument here is that Toughness/Peril are not "resolved" so Don't Be Hasty cannot activate before?  I only ask, because while currently I do not think it matters, suppose the hero you ready with Don't Be Hasty has a theoretical attachment "When this hero readies, deal 1 damage to an enemy".  This might allow you to damage the enemy, bypassing its Toughness.  My personal opinion is that Toughness/Peril do not "resolve" so Don't Be Hasty cannot trigger before it, but want to make sure such an argument has no unintended consequences.

 

Thanks for submitting the question. I sent Caleb 20 or so questions but I have a feeling I overwhelmed him  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

As for #2, I agree. Immunity, Peril, and Toughness are not keywords that "Resolve"
