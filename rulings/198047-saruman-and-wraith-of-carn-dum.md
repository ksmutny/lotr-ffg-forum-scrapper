If I play Saruman ally and target the Wraith of Carn Dum, do I need to trigger its effect?

The question also applies to Banks of the Anduin, Forbidden Descent, Weather Hills, and Abandoned Camp.

I got an answer from Caleb to my sword-thain question in another thread where the question is quite similar.

To trigger "leave play"-events the card must phyiscally moved out of the game. A "considered as out of play" does not move the card, so no, you can not trigger its forced effect.
