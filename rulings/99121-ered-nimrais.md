His text is the next one:

Response: After Ered Nimrais Prospector enters play, discard the top 3 cards of your deck. Then, choose and shuffle 1 card from your discard pile back into your deck.
 

A little question: if you dont have cards in your deck, can you anyway choose 1 card from you discard pile and put into your deck?

You provided two interesting examples, and I'm glad you did because they highlight the difference between immediate effects and lasting effects.
 
Immediate effects are effects that are fully resolved as soon as they are triggered, whereas lasting effects affect the game state for a specified amount of time. Because they always say something like "until the end of the phase" or "until the end of the round" lasting effects are easy to identify.
 
Let me use your examples to demonstrate:
 
Chaos in the Cavern : has an immediate effect (return all enemies to the staging area) that if it triggers creates a lasting effect (each Goblin gets +1 threat strength until the end of the phase). If there are no enemies engaged with players at the time Chaos is revealed, then it cannot trigger because no enemies are returned to the staging area. That means the "then" clause will not trigger and Goblins will not get +1 threat strength.
 
Treacherous Fog : works the opposite way. It creates a lasting effect (locations in the staging area gets +1 threat strength) that triggers an immediate effect (players with 35+ threat must discard 1 card). Since this lasting effect affect the game state, it will always resolve. Even if there are no locations in the staging area at the time Treacherous Fog is revealed, locations will still get +1 threat strength until the end of the phase. That means if a location is added to the staging area after Treacherous Fog is revealed, it will get +1 threat until the end of the phase. Because the lasting effect of Treacherous Fog always resolves, it also means the "then" clause will also always resolve.
 
So, if there are no locations when Treacherous Fog is revealed, it still resolves because it has successfully created a lasting effect. However, if there are no enemies engaged with players at the time Chaos in the Cavern is revealed, it cannot resolve its immediate effect and you should not resolve the "then" effect.
 
Cheers,
Caleb
 


----------------------------------------



The FAQ says...
 

(1.15) The word “then” If a card effect uses the word “then,” then the preceding effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent dependent effect to resolve.


So, this is new to me.. dose this now mean that effects also do not trigger if the then fails?

Treacherous Fog
When Revealed: Each location in the staging area gets +1 Threat Strength until the end of the phase. Then, each player with a threat of 35 or higher chooses and discards 1 card from his hand.

Chaos in the Cavern
When Revealed: All engaged enemies return to the staging area. Then, each Goblin enemy gets +1 [Threat] until the end of the phase.

These two, and many like it... if the first fails... dose the 2nd part not happen? Like with the Fog, if you have no locations in the staging area... is that a fail? With Chaos is there are no goblins engaged.. dose that fail?,,, and with those failing.. the part after the "THEN" also fails right? This can not be right!... right?

Hidden Threat, Sleeping Sentry, Ill Purpose, slick footing,. .. etc etc etc.. many cards have effects that can fizzle.. these can not all have the text after the then fail as well right?

I can see your point, booored.

 

But:

 

 

"Each location gets X" is  passive.

 

"Returnall Goblins to X" is active.

 

I think if Caleb had used the "active" and "passive" term, it would IMO be much clearer and more fitting.

 

 

And re: Spider's Web - I think there is a diffference between not being able to exhaust a hero and a hero already being exhausted. This action would only fail if the hero had an attachment that says "cannot be exhausted ever". I think it is very clear what the card's intention is*.

 

Another example: if you tell someone to sleep who is already sleeping, he didn't really fail to obey your command.

 

 

* okay, I already said this a couple of times, and then Caleb ruled it otherwise  <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]

Yeah, this is what I was afraid of.  After the ruling, people still have no agreement about now to interpret cards.  Even to the point of directly contradicting the ruling itself.  KennedyHawk, see booored's post with the official ruling on the previous page in this thread, which basically says the opposite of what you are saying -- if "All enemies return to the staging area" moves no enemies, the effect fails and the "then" clause will not resolve.  All because the enemy movement is not a "lasting effect."

 

specific quote from the ruling (for expediency): "if there are no enemies engaged with players at the time Chaos in the Cavern is revealed, it cannot resolve its immediate effect and you should not resolve the "then" effect" - Caleb

 

This is murky and probably an erroneous ruling, imo.

To me, this is a new rule, taken from the ruling by Caleb.

I’ve thought on it and analyzed it.

I’ll try to clarify it from the lengthy explanation given:

 

 

Quote Caleb:

"Immediate effects are effects that are fully resolved as soon as they are triggered, whereas lasting effects affect the game state for a specified amount of time. Because they always say something like "until the end of the phase" or "until the end of the round" lasting effects are easy to identify."

 

 

Quote FAQ:

(1.15) The word “then”

If a card effect uses the word “then,” then the preceding

effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent

dependent effect to resolve.

 

 

 

So in it’s core it says this:

 

-Immediate effect: if it FAILS you DON’T resolve the “THEN” part.

 

-Lasting effect: ALWAYS resolve the “THEN” part.

 

 

It’s not that hard after thinking on it a bit, and I’ll try to follow this new ruling.

Though now the “IF ABLE” text came up.

The way I see it, “IF ABLE” means it is has to be done WHEN YOU CAN.

If not, you should still RESOLVE the “THEN” part as “IF ABLE” means it’s conditional.

 

 

This is how I read it though….

No.. this is the point. As Noccus sumerised....

 



Quote Caleb:

"Immediate effects are effects that are fully resolved as soon as they are triggered, whereas lasting effects affect the game state for a specified amount of time. Because they always say something like "until the end of the phase" or "until the end of the round" lasting effects are easy to identify."

 



-Immediate effect: if it FAILS you DON’T resolve the “THEN” part.

-Lasting effect: ALWAYS resolve the “THEN” part.



The VERY example he uses proves you wrong

 



Quote Caleb:

Chaos in the Cavern : has an immediate effect (return all enemies to the staging area) that if it triggers creates a lasting effect (each Goblin gets +1 threat strength until the end of the phase). If there are no enemies engaged with players at the time Chaos is revealed, then it cannot trigger because no enemies are returned to the staging area. That means the "then" clause will not trigger and Goblins will not get +1 threat strength.



By your way of thinking this would resolve as it returns "0" goblins to the staging area. the text "return all enemies to the staging area" is nearly identical to "Return all goblins to the staging area"

 

The crux of this ruling is the terms IMMEDIATE and PERMANENT.

> The Spider's Web (Mirkwood Nighmare): When Revealed: The player with the highest threat exhaust all heroes he controls. Then, attach this card to one of that player's heroes...
> 
> ...if i have all my heroes exhausted (for example, commited), i mustn't attach that nasty card to anybody, isn't? Nice!!! (for example, if you see it is coming by Denethor, i will exhaust all my heroes before it is revealed)

 

On this I can say people will make mistakes.

Because the ruling makes it quite murky indeed:

 

FAQ:

"Q: If I can’t discard 3 resources from all of my heroes

due to Bitter Wind (KD 56), do I have to partially fulfill

the effect?

A: Yes, players should resolve as much of any

“discard” effect as they are able to."

 

Which means exhaust all available heroes.

None exhausted? Exhaust all. + resolve "then" = attach.

Some exhausted? Exhaust the rest. + resolve "then" = attach.

All exhausted? no exhausting = FAIL IMMEDIATE EFFECT! no resolving "then" = NO attaching.

 

As others stated, this new ruling is odd & murky. 

 

On second thought, maybe we should ask Caleb to rethink his ruling and just let the whole text resolve on every card?

After a bit of thinking I want this to rule to change.

Who's with me on asking Caleb to reconsider this ruling?

If we get people to sign this, we'll bring this thread to his attention, and ask for a re-ruling?
