# [Expecting Mischief Timing Question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85648-expecting-mischief-timing-question/)

So first up--sorry if this has already been answered. On phone so it's hard to check.

 

My question is simple--does expecting mischief trigger before or after an encounter cards "when revealed" effect? Also, does it trigger before keywords like "surge" or "doomed" like Thalin does (I assume not  based on the different language)?

 

Thanks in advance for the help!

UPDATE!

I contacted FF and Caleb dropped me a line to clear things up.

Official word is that as the effect comes into play BEFORE any encounter card is revealed it triggers before keywords and "when revealed" effects. If the enemy is destroyed, those effects never trigger.

Great, great news for this card. Now an auto-include for me in all 3 or 4 player games where I have any lore.

Now that I think about it though, I have another question--this time about its interaction w/ Thalin. As they are simultaneous effects could the first player chose to NOT trigger Expecting Mischief against a 1hp enemy by triggering Thalin's effect first an killing it? Would that allow Expecting Mischief to trigger on the next enemy revealed or would it simply not trigger?

Hmmmm...
