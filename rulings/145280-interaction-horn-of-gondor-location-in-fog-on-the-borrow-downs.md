# [Interaction: Horn of Gondor + Location in Fog on the Borrow-Downs](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/145280-interaction-horn-of-gondor-location-in-fog-on-the-borrow-downs/)

There is a location in the quest Fog on the Borrow-Downs that I don't know the english name of. In German it is called "Uraltes Hügelgrab".

It takes allies from play and puts them face down under the location.

When the location gets explored, then they get returned to hand.

 

Question now is: Does this interact with Horn of Gondor, and if it does, when?

I see three scenarios here:

1. You get the ressources when they get faced down, as they now leave play.

2. You get the ressources when they get returned to hand, as they did not leave play, but just where faced down.

3. You don't get ressources at all: Because when they get faced down, they don't leave play. And when they get returned to hand, they are no Allies anymore, just some facedown cards that get returned.

 

What do you think? Or is there a definit answer in the FAQ already?

I'm pretty sure this doesn't count as leaving play, based on a comparison with the first quest of The Lost Realm:

Iarion [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Iarion-TLR] causes you to lose the game if he leaves play.

Rescue Iarion [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Rescue-Iarion-TLR] takes Iarion and puts him facedown under it.

 

Since obviously the designers intended this sidequest to be part of the quest, not simply make you lose the moment it's revealed, we can conclude that putting a card facedown does not inherently mean that card has left play.

 

This does seem somewhat inconsistent though, so I'd ask Caleb to be sure. Might be a rules clarification or errata is needed somewhere to make everything make sense.
