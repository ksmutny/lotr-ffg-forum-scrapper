I read an old thread on this forum about overpowered decks. One poster said that it was easy to fix dwarves by just banning Dain, but that it was harder to fix Outlands. His suggestion was to ban the Anfalas Herdman, so that all outland allies remained squishy with one single hit point.

 

I think there is a better way: don't allow Outlands bonuses to stack. In other words, Knight of the Swan only gives Outlands allies +1 attack, regardless of whether you have one or all three in play. If you have all four types of allies in play, Outland allies get +1 willpower, +1 attack, +1 defense and +1 hit point.

 

This is a big nerf, but the Outlands deck should still be competitive. It is fairly easy to get one of each ally in play, and max out the bonus. A 2 cost ally with stats 2, 2, 2, 2 is still a really good ally.

 

1 cost Outland allies max stats: 1, 1, 1, 2.

2 cost Outland allies max stats: 2, 2, 2, 2.

3 cost Forlong (which refreshes every phase) max stats: 2, 2, 2, 4.

Hirluin the Fair max stats: 2, 2, 2, 5.

I'm not sure if anyone else has listened to the podcast where Caleb describes the purpose of Outlands. There were a fair number of people playing the game that sent in complaints saying they legitimately did not like to build decks and just wanted to play. So with Outlands you can just put every card that says "Outlands" into one stack and call it a deck, and it will be strong and simple to play. Great to give to new players to the group as well, as they can feel strong and may be willing to play more and perhaps try more intricate decks like Silvan or Gandalf.

 

With that in mind, Outlands is pretty much where it should be and a nerf would go against the philosophy that it was built upon.
