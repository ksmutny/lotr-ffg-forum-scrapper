Ok, just played my first two games with core set :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Loved it.

 

I played the passage through Mirkwood twice and both times used the leadership deck with Aragorn, Theodred and Gloin heroes. I wanted to get the feel of the game rules and mechanics for my first tries and so didnt want to mix things up with different quests or decks.

 

Really enjoyed it and one both times (yes I know its a starter quest) and didnt lose any heroes.

 

First game I made some early poor choices and both Gloin and Theodred took a chunk of damage as I didnt have any allies in play yet so they soaked on defensive moves. Rallied somewhat and pushed through to finally take the Beorn path on the last stage. I had managed to get the Aragorn pendant thingy attached to him to boost questing and so did a mad dash questing run to get loads of points on there to finish, while holding off a beastmaster with allies. A nasty little revealed treachery card did one damage to a load of characters (exhausted ones I think) which left Theodred on one remaining health, but he held on. Quest point were gained and game won :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Second game, same setup. This time I got a few allies out to soak some damage and kept heroes fresh for attacks and started much stronger. Also managed to get Aragorn pendant thingy again which helped a lot. This time, the random pick on part 3 came up as the other quest and I had 2 of 3 heroes exhausted, but I still decided to go for speed and at the quest text searched and found Ungoliant Spawn and put straight into play. On the combat phase I had enough tokens to play a Gondor Banner to up my attack (but not defense as no Gondor characters) for the round. Ungoliant Spawn came in against one of my lowly allies who soaked the damage and crumbled to nothing.  My remaining hero had his attack buffed so he did a good strike on the spider but not enough to take all that health down. Next turn, no sense in questing so everybody was ready against Ungolint Spawn. I had another gondor banner to play and so down it went sending a buff around the party. The spider received another lowly ally as its defender and the poor sole simply perished. I then exhaused every remaining card as attackers, all buffed and did enough damage to take the spider down, which was good as next turn my threat would have increased to a level that there was an orcish card sat in staging waiting to join the fray, that would not have helped. All heroes did still have some damage this game, but not near as much as the last.

 

Overall, I had great fun!!

It involved a lot of leafing through the rulebook trying to get things right and remember rules, but that is to be expected in a new game. Generally I felt the rules played really well especially as a solo player

 

I was very happy with the games, and am very much looking forward to getting to the point where I know the rules well enough to mix in a lot of advance cards, later quests and some considered deck building. While it did need some rule-thinking, it ran very smooth for a first attempt and I am really looking forward to the game getting better and better.

 

My next plan for a game session will be to try a different starter deck with passage through Mirkwood, and go straight through into journey down the anduin. That way, I stick with the same easy first encounter, but spice it with a new deck, then jump into a new adventure with that same deck afterwards. Very much looking forward to it.

 

Thought it would be nice to put a post up about this first experience and also to say thank you to all those people on the forum who have given me advice over the last two weeks in my new foray into this game. It helped me with the choice to buy the game, heped me with choices over first purchases and accessories such as sleeves, carry cases, playmats etc. All advice has been appreciated and the results of this afternoons play are that it was all worth it.

Thank you very much.

On with the adventuring!!

As another newbie, I'm rooting for you alexbobspoons! I'm still in Dwarrowdelf and I'm a little nervous about reaching HoN based on its fearsome reputation. It sounds like there were some serious balance problems with the design of that cycle. It is reassuring to know that Caleb managed to strike a better balance with the sagas and subsequent cycles.
