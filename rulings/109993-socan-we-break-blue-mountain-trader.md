Anyone else think this card must be broken in some yet-to-be-discovered way ?
 

The closest I can get is the following :

 

Pass to player with horn of gondor equipped.

He gives you a resource and passes trader back.

You discard it which triggers the horn.

 

Use stand and fight to get it back again ? Repeat ?

 

Admittedly this isn't quite there yet (it's zero balancing up to the stand and fight part, after which you are one resource down), but something along these lines ?

 

Do your best !

I talked to Caleb. It's not.

Well, it's not like there are a lot more other topic that adress the "move ressource" ruling with official answer from Caleb :

 

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1044315/harbor-master-and-errand-rider [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1044315/harbor-master-and-errand-rider] is one of them.

 

Or you can use the search function at the top of the forum.

 

That being said, stop spreading false rumor, it has been denied early when the ally was spoiled.

 

I was thinking about posting a large post about blue mountain trader, like I did for desesperate alliance (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1033236/desperate-alliance-underestimate-combo-card [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1033236/desperate-alliance-underestimate-combo-card]) because there is a lot of things possible with him !

Blood of Gondor, Gondorian Fire, Lay of Nimrodel, Hirluin, Elrond, Desesperate Alliance, Steed of the March, Ellandan, Elrohir, Parting Gifts, Gaining Strengh, Boromir II, Visionary Leadership, Gloin I, Aragorn I, Balin, Hail of Stone, and my special Nor Am I a Stranger/Mutual Accord/Sword of Morthond where you can add Ever My Heart Rise, Ring Mail, Dwarrowdelf Axe.

That's should be most of them.

 

 

EDIT : Oh, I see why there is so much post for this nonsense now : http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1196970/resolved-1000-defense-harbor-master [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1196970/resolved-1000-defense-harbor-master] with yet anothers official response from Caleb...

No offense to Caleb (He's still the man), but this answer is a stretch at best.  It feels like it's straight out of left field.  Oh well, I'll add that to the list and roll with it.  Might I recommend a LotR LCG dictionary to be published alongside the FAQ?  Harbor Master is crying silently over this one too.  He almost had his big break...
