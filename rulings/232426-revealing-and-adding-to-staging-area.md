I believe I have this right, but if when an encounter card is revealed, it's not part of the staging area, correct?

 

First time playing "The Siege of Gondor" and the quest card says Ship locations in the staging area are immune to player card effects. I've revealed a Ship location, but I assume I can play Strider's Path on it to make it the active location because I don't believe it's part of the staging area yet.

Caleb's response to my email is Strider's Path doesn't work in this instant. He wrote...

 

After an enemy or location is revealed, it is added to the staging area. Since Strider’s Path triggers “After a location is revealed…” that means the location would be in the staging area when you play it. As a result, a Ship location would be immune to its effect, preventing you from targeting the Ship location with Strider’s Path.

 

 

Seems very off to me (and I've replied asking for more clarification with other instances) but unless he says different, you'll want to alter your doc.

 

As much as I love this game, I hate all the hoops  the FAQ and corner cases jump thru to prevent certain card combos. It gets discouraging and can drive newbies away. His response seems to imply that "The Door is Closed" shouldn't work in this case either, which seems doubly wrong to me. I thought that card could work on cards that are "Immune to player card effects" because the encounter card hasn't entered the game yet. Or am I wrong about that?
