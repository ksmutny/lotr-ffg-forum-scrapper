Hi. A couple of quick questions about threat elimination for a player with a "must not leave play" character (e.g. Bilbo Baggins in the Hobbit Saga quests).

 

(1) If the first player is eliminated on threat, does the character move to the new first player's control when the token is passed on, or is he eliminated (and all players losing at that point). 

 

(2) Is the situation any different with two key characters (e.g. Sahir and Na'asiyah allies in the Dreamchaser cycle), one with the first player, and one for the last?

> With this thread and the one about EotMM we now know that the cards etc. under a player's control are removed from the game, not discarded. I hope they add that to the official FAQ and errata.

 

Honestly, since sappidus said that Caleb answered in "like 10 minutes", I wouldn't put too much importance on his choice of phrasing. I don't think he meant to contradict the official rules, which on page 22 say that the eliminated player's cards are played in "their owners' discard piles". If he had said "removed from play", then his ruling would have had the exact same effect on what he was ruling (objective allies that cause the players to lose when they leave play), but he wouldn't have been contradicting the rulebook.

 

I think Caleb simply wrote in haste, and did not intend to make a ruling that changes the core rulebook in a 10-minute response.

I cannot say what designer intent is, but a ruling that an eliminated player's cards* are removed from the game seems pretty kosher to me.

If you want to parse Caleb's words with lawyerlike/religious intensity, though, he did not *precisely* say that in his response to my Stand and Fight question...

> Great question. The answer is no, because you cannot search the discard pile of a player who is not a part of the game. Once a player is eliminated from the game, he is no longer part of it.

This is a pretty clean answer with respect to cards that player controlled that he didn't own, e.g., attachments from others. (This is why I asterisked "cards" above, as DukeWellington's summary of a potential Core rules revision in his post is slightly inaccurate in that regard.) Edited September 24, 2016 by sappidus

If I'd been aware of that ruling ("Once a player is eliminated from the game, he is no longer part of it"), I probably wouldn't have written what I did about Caleb's writing in haste, because it's consistent with that ruling.

 

So, to sum up, mostly for my own benefit so that others can check if I got anything wrong:

 

1) When a player is eliminated, all the cards he controls get put into their owner's discard piles. If someone else had previously played an Unexpected Courage on him, it goes into its owner's discard pile, not his. If he played a Steward of Gondor on someone else, he doesn't control it, so it stays in the game. But if it later gets discarded for any reason, it goes into his out-of-the-game discard pile and is no longer retrievable by any means.

 

2) At that time, any "leaving play" effects can be triggered on that player's cards, as per Nate's ruling on the EotMM thread: "A card "leaves play" any time it moves from an in-play state to an out of play state (hand, deck, discard pile, removed from game)." (Emphasis mine).

 

3) If that player controlled "vital" heroes or objective allies, who follow the first player token but cause the players to lose the game if they leave play, they leave play before the first player token passes, so the players lose. Do not let the first player threat out during the turn when they're holding the Fellowship ally.

 

Do I have that right?
