My friends and I just finished playing the scenario Flies and Spiders (in the 2nd Hobbit saga expansion) and we have two questions:

 

1. The rules insert says that an unconcious character cannot trigger abilities, and from the FAQ, triggered abilities are defined as "Triggered abilities are abilities on cards that have a bold trigger word such as Action or Response. These abilities are only applied when they are triggered."

I have the new Gandalf (OHaUH 10) in play, which has the card text "Forced: At the end of the refresh phase, discard Gandalf from play...", who becomes unconcious.

Does his Forced Response still trigger at the end of the refresh phase?  We played it as it would not trigger.

 

2. Before we go to Stage 2, an Ancient Mathom (SoM 56, "After the attached location is explored, the first player draws 3 cards") is played on a Location in the staging area.  Then we go to Stage 2, and separate the first player to Stage 3 and the others go to Stage 4, which has the Location with the Ancient Mathom.

On subsequent turn, the Location with the Ancient Mathom is explored, can the first player draws 3 cards?  We don't think so because the first player is not with that staging area, and the rules insert says that "Players cannot affect other players (or cards controlled by players) that do not share a common staging area. This means that you cannot lower a player’s threat, play an attachment on one of his characters, etc., unless that player shares a staging area with you."; although, incidentally in our case, the Ancient Mathom is previously played by the now first player.

What do you think?

I've got the reply from Caleb:

Hi Angus,
Good question. Gandalf's Forced effect is a triggered ability, so if he is made unconscious his Forced effect will not trigger and he will not be discarded at the end of the refresh phase.
Cheers,
Caleb
