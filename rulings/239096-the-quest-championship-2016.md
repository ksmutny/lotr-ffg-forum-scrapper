Thank you to Thanatopsis for hosting another great Hero Championship this year! I enjoyed participating and watching the results come in.

 

In the past years we've often followed it with other championships, and this year I wanted to start one myself.

 

Here is the 2016 Quest Championship!

 

It will work differently than the Hero Championship, because I've decided to make the first round a Swiss-style Tournament.

 

There will be 7 rounds of matchups, where you will vote on 43 pairings of the 86 quests. There will be no elimination throughout the 7 rounds, so you will always have 43 matches to vote on. The nice thing about this is that after it's done, we should have a complete ranking of the all the quests in the game.

 

After the Swiss tournament, I will take the top 16 quests and we will have an elimination-style tournament to crown the ultimate quest of 2016!

 

Check out http://challonge.com/lotrquest2016 [http://challonge.com/lotrquest2016] to vote!

Note: You are not required to vote in every matchup. If a matchup contains a quest you've never played, you can abstain from voting on it if you wish.

 

The Swiss rounds will be quick, with only 2 days for each round:

Rounds will end at Noon EST (UTC-5) on the following dates:

Round 1: Jan 10

Round 2: Jan 12

Round 3: Jan 14

Round 4: Jan 16

Round 5: Jan 18

Round 6: Jan 20

Round 7: Jan 22

 

The Elimination rounds will be longer, with 3 days for each round:

Rounds will end at Noon EST (UTC-5) on the following dates:

Top 16: Jan 25

Top 8: Jan 28

Top 4: Jan 31

Finals: Feb 3

 

Enjoy, and thanks for voting!

Meanwhile, in Roseville, Minnesota, Caleb Grace and Matt Newman begin furiously taking notes. "Why didn't we think to collect this kind of data before?" one of them mutters.
