Hi all,

 

I've read some threads on this discussion but it was not clear to me, so therefore this new topic with some more related questions.

 

Made a new deck lately in which I pull of the Song of Mocking alongside with Treebeard hero. Main motivations for doing this is keeping Treebeard alive and some heroes for benefiting on some damage (Gloin, Gimli).

 

Question 1, If you use Treebeard his action while Song of Mocking is active on him, does he still get the Willpower and Attack boost?

 

Answer 1, Since Treebeard never got any damage dealt, he cannot receive the boost.

 

 

Question 2, Because the Action starts, with  "deal 1 damage to Treebeard", I was wondering if I could actually trigger this action. Since it is impossible to deal any damage to Treebeard (because of the song), can I actually trigger this action to transfer the damage to Gloin?

 

Answer 2, No Clue

 

Question 3, Suppose the answer to Question 2 is "Yes", The Action clearly says "Deal 1 damage to Treebeard to give him [boost]". Since you are not giving him the boost, does this damage dealt still count toward the "limit 5 times per phase" ?

 

Answer 3, I guess so.

 

It's not entirely clear, because by playing the action you immediately deal the damage, but by song of mocking the damage is assigned to another hero. Also sending this to the developers, answers soon I hope.

Reply from Caleb,

I’m writing back to correct my previous answer to your rules question regarding Treebeard and Song of Mocking. I’m afraid I didn’t read Song of Mocking closely enough the first time. Song of Mocking is a replacement effect because it uses the word “instead.” Instead of putting damage on Treebeard, you put damage on the hero with Song of Mocking attached. As a result, you never actually damage Treebeard, which means you never paid the cost for his effect. As a result, you cannot use Song of Mocking to redirect the damage for Treebeard’s effect.

I’m sorry I answered that incorrectly the first time.

Cheers,

Caleb

Still a method for getting damage on Gloin or Gimli at will, but not nearly as good. I find the ruling makes sense to me, but Caleb's focus on the word "instead" doesn't. Even if Song of Mocking said "After damage has been dealt to another hero, cancel that damage and deal an equal amount of damage to a hero with the Song attached" it still wouldn't work because the damage got cancelled, as we see with the Erkenbrand/Wing helm ruling. They are basically saying with all these "Deal X damage to" effects that if you don't visibly see damage counters on the card after you're done, it doesn't work. It's a fair ruling, but I think ruling the opposite way would have also been fair and at the same time opened up more card combination possibilities. I love it when new cards make old, unused cards suddenly useful, but I guess today is not the day.

With all due respect, that answer makes absolutely no sense. The only thing that answer adds to the conversation is confusion.

I contacted Caleb once more to get this clear.

 

Question 1, If you use Treebeard his action while Song of Mocking is active on him, does he still get the Willpower and Attack boost?

 

Question 2, Because the Action starts, with  "deal 1 damage to Treebeard", I was wondering if I could actually trigger this action. Since it is impossible to deal any damage to Treebeard (because of Song of Mocking), can I actually trigger this action to transfer the damage to Gloin?

 

> I’m sorry for the confusion. You are correct that Song of Mocking does not use the word “instead” - I can’t explain why I thought that it did.

> 
> Question #1 - Treebeard does not get his willpower or attack bonus from his Action effect unless damage is actually placed on him.
> 
> Question #2 - You can trigger the action (up to 5 times) and redirect the damage to Gloin with Song of Mocking.
> 
> The way this works is that you trigger Treebeard’s Action, but when you place the damage Song of Mocking redirects it to Gloin. Which means it is never placed on Treebeard, and his effect does not resolve. In essence, you trigger Treebeard’s effect and then cancel it by placing 1 damage on Gloin instead.
