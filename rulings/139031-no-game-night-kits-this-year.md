Has anyone heard if they are doing Game Night Kits this year for LOTR? At this point in 2014 there was already news of the first kit, but this year they haven't said a word.

I believe that they will be announced later in the Spring. Also, Caleb has specifically mentioned that there will be something special at GenCon this year. No word yet on what it might be, but it most likely will be something that other players get as well (just like the GenCon decks).
