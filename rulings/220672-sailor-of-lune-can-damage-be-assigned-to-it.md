# [Sailor of Lune - can damage be assigned to it?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220672-sailor-of-lune-can-damage-be-assigned-to-it/)

After a play-through of Flight from Moria tonight with my Noldor deck, I want to make sure I'm interpreting the Sailor of Lune's "cannot take damage" clause correctly.

 

If my Sailor of Lune is committed to the quest and I have an Event card in my discard pile, he gains: "+1 Willpower and cannot be damaged while committed to the quest". If I get hit with a card like Undisturbed Bones (When Revealed: Each player must deal X damage to an ally he controls. X is the number of allies he controls.), can I assign the damage to the Sailor of Lune and in turn have the Sailor take no damage? Or am I simply not allowed to assign the damage to the Sailor and thus forced to assign it to another ally?

> You can only assign Frodo 2 points of archery, as I recall, that's where the ruling I was talking about came from. Well, specifically it was getting more complicated by introducing Song of Mocking as well (So you can assign 2 to Frodo then you have to stop, but then you can assign 5 to a different hero and use Song of Mocking to redirect to Frodo, and since after assigning the damage is all dealt simultaneously it doesn't violate Frodo's once per phase limit. Assuming I'm remembering correctly)

 

Here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121857-archery-and-frodo/?hl=%2Barchery+%2Bfrodo] it is.

It must be divided among characters you control until either there is no damage left to assign or no characters left to assign it to. The damage is applied simultaneously, so you can assign damage to more than 1 Silvan Refugee because their Forced effect will not trigger until after all the damage has been assigned.

I received a response from Caleb regarding various damage questions:

 

If Sailor of Lune's effect is currently active due to the top card of your discard pile being an event can she be the target of the following effects while committed to the quest:

 

> 1) Dol Guldur Beastmaster
> 
> 2) Low on Provisions (just says "assigns")
> 
> 3) Dunland Raider (says "must deal")
> 
> 4) Goblin Taskmaster (says "deals", but does not say "must deal")
> 
> 5) If Take Cover! is revealed while Sailor of Lune cannot be damaged and is exhausted, must you choose the second option on Take Cover!?

 

 

> Hi Chris,
> The word ‘cannot’ is an absolute, so you cannot choose to assign or deal damage to Sailor of Lune while the top card of your discard pile is an event.
> Cheers,

I asked for clarification on his initial response, especially regarding examples 1) and 5) as I thought it still wasn't clear and I received the following response

 

> Hi Chris,
> Take Cover! - This card does not specifically target the Sailor of Lune but rather ‘each exhausted character’ and as a result you can choose the first option and the Sailor of Lune’s ability will prevent the damage.
>  
> Dol Guldur Orcs - This enemy’s ‘when revealed’ effect first asks you to target a character committed to the quest, so Sailor of Lune can be a valid target if it is questing. Then, it attempts to deal 2 damage to that character. Sailor of Lune’s ability will prevent the damage.
