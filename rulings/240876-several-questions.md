1) What happens if I reveal Call of the Ring [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Call-of-the-Ring-TLoS] and all Nazgûl enemies are already in play? Can I whiff and find cero Nazgûl enemies, or if that's the case then I'm forced to exhaust the One Ring and reveal an encounter card?

 

"When Revealed: The first player must choose: either search the encounter deck, discard pile, and victory display for a Nazgul enemy and add it to the staging area, or exhaust The OneRing [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?Trait=Ring.] and reveal the top card of the encounter deck." 

 

2) What happens if I optionally engage an enemy and I use Roheryn [http://ringsdb.com/find?q=roheryn] to attack that enemy asap, but the enemy has a forced effect when engaged? For example, Haradrim Soldier [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Haradrim-Soldier-TLoS], who makes an immediate attack when engaged. Which effect resolves first? 

 

"Response: After you optionally engage an enemy, exhaust Roheryn and attached hero to declare attached hero as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against that enemy."

 

"Forced: After Haradrim Soldier engages you, it makes an immediate attack."

 

3) With Peace, and Thought [http://ringsdb.com/find?q=peace%2C+and+thought], can I exhaust heroes from other players to draw 5 cards?

 

"Refresh Action: Exhaust 2 heroes to draw 5 cards."

 

4) I still can't understand side quests' rules completely:

- If I'm right, a side quest can only be chosen as the current quest only at the beginning of the questing phase, and remains so until the end of that quest phase, after which the main quest "comes back" to be the current quest. Yet, the effects of side quests are always active regardless of whether side quests are the current quest or not (as long as these side quests are in the staging area, of course). Am I correct so far?

- My main question regarding side quests is: what happens with the main quest when a side quest becomes the current quest? Do the effects of the main quest remain active (despite not being the current quest) during that period, or should they be ignored? I specially got confused playing Helm's Deep, because of the Defense keyword. What happens here, and in general?

I though so too because Roheryn was designed to prevent enemy attacks but still that situation could go either way so I send in the rule question describing and linking this thread here and Caleb responded:

> When you optionally engage a Haradrim Soldier as a player that controls a character with Roheryn equipped you must, per FAQ, resolve the Forced-Effect of the Soldier before you resolve the Response of Roheryn. So what happens?
> 
> a) The Forced-Effect of the Haradrim Soldier is fully resolved when you have initiated the attack, dealt a shadowcard and would choose a defender. At that moment you could trigger Roheryns response and (with enough attackpower) kill the attacking enemy.
> 
> b) The Forced-Effect of the Haradrim Soldier is fully resolved when the complete attack is done (dealing a shadowcard, declaring defender, reveal shadowcard, assign damage) and after that you have the option to trigger Roheryns Response.

> Option a) could potentially avoid a full attack of that soldier while option b) would potentially kill the defending character. Thanks for your help!

> In the situation you describe, you would resolve it as follows:
> - The Haradrim Soldier engages you triggering its Forced effect.
> - Deal the Haradrim Soldier a shadow card.
> - You may now trigger Roheryn’s Response effect to interrupt the Haradrim Soldier’s attack with an attack of your own.
> - If the attack destroys the Haradrim Soldier, then its attack is canceled because the attacking enemy is not there anymore.
> - If the attack does not destroy the Haradrim Soldier, then continue to resolve its attack once yours has resolved.
> Note that you can also achieve this type of outcome by playing Quick Strike during an action window of an enemy’s attack, or by putting Gandalf into play with Sneak Attack and dealing 4 damage to the Haradrim Soldier.

So there you have it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
