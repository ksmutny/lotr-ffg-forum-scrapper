When playing the fellowship event, we had a difference of opinion on the timing of the Host of Angmar.  Stage 1f of the quest says:

Forced: At the beginning of the round (before the resource phase), place 1 resource here.  Then, if there are 4 resources here, advance to stage 2.

Stage 2f says;

Forced: At the beginning of the round, and 1 set aside Host of Angmar (from any state's set aside area) to this staging area.

I felt this would happen one after the other, but some other players felt the start of turn would have past before you move on to 2f. Thefore you would not see a Host til your second turn there.  I'm running an epic multiplayer game on Saturday, and I'm hoping to get some confirmation on how this works.
