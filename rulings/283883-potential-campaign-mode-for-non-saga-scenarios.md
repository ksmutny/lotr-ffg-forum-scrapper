# [Potential Campaign Mode for non-Saga scenarios?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283883-potential-campaign-mode-for-non-saga-scenarios/)

I got really excited with the discussion in the other thread about what future features/ideas we would like to see in the game. Someone mentioned a new campaign mode and after digging around I found this quote by Caleb:

How do you think this could be implemented? Maybe add a kit/box of sorts to the existing line-up that connects scenarios? Or build a new set of expansions that have a tighter narrative like the Arkham Horror LCG? Personally I would love something like that, especially if we can gain loot and other boons moving forward. Other ideas?
