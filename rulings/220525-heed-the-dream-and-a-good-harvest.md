Just a rule question. Can you use A Good Harvest to pay the resources in other sphere cards (like Heed the Dream, but any really) of which you have no resource icon? Seems a bit ambiguous to me.

> If I use Gandalf's ability to play Mithrandir's Advice off the top of my deck, do I get to consider Gandalf to have a printed lore icon when resolving the action on the card? In other words, when does the phrase "when playing a card this way" stop working? Is it when I've finished paying the cost of the card, or is it when I finish resolving the text on the card?

I thought having him retain the icons while resolving the card could lead to some shenanigans when playing Quick Strike. i.e Gandalf would have the printed icons through all the steps of combat. But I asked Caleb about this and he said it wouldn't work.
