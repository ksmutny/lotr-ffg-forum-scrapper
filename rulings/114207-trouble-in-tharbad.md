I have played this quest 3 times so far (all victories) when i saw the cards for the first time i thought that it will be a running quest (high will power, questing, questing and questing some more) fortunately it wasn't. So my impressions. First of all it has a very unique and fresh feel to it. The 4 difficulty of FFG is very close to reality it is definitely not hard and it is a little above easy. Lastly this is a quest that will make many people revisit (or try for the first time) secrecy.

I like to read your thoughts and you opinion about it. I personally liked it, i find it to be a really fresh, unique and loose experience.

Hmm, so the attack is directed at Nalir but if you have other defenders you can actually defend with those? Wow, that sounds very interesting and creative. Props to Caleb and Matt for coming up with an actually interesting escort mission. So at first we had Arwen who contributed but was in no real danger (and if she was, you were dead already), and now I had thought that they had gone to the other extreme, that Nalir was absolutely vulnerable to attacks made directly to him. But know that I know that you can defend him with other characters, the quest becomes so much more interesting!

Hmmmm that is a tricky one.

It reads "The first player EITHER removes 1 time counter or each spy enemy gets -20 engagement and +1 attack" so with that wording it seems like you can choose EITHER effect whether or not any spy enemies are in play.

Also you technically can resolve the second option as you can give each spy enemy in staging -20 engagement and +1 attack there just aren't any actual spy enemies in play to give these effects to.

This thread comes to a similar conclusion and Caleb ruled that with Followed by Night even if no enemies are in play you can choose the second option:

It does use the word ALL enemies instead of EACH however...

 

Also look at this thread: http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/114412-must-either-back/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/114412-must-either-back/]

If it was MUST either x or y then you would have to do x and only do y if you cannot do x. Considering you can always remove a time counter in this quest this wouldn't really even make sense so I'm pretty **** sure thanks to these two threads from the past that you can choose either option even if there are no spy enemies in play =)
