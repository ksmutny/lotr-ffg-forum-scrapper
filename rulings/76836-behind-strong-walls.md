# [Behind Strong Walls](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/)

## 1 [rexhaha on January 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=743590)

After Gondorian Spearman (or any defending character) killed the attacking enemy with his response (or Goblin Cleaver), is he still considered a defending character to use Behind Strong Walls?

I can't see anywhere in the rulebook saying missing attacking enemy will immediately end the attack.

Hi Folks,

I did not want to open a new thread ... after a the question if you can play Behind Strong Walls on a defending Gondor-character which is not exhausted my first thought was no. But others say yes .. so i asked Caleb:

> Quote

> Hi Jan,
> You cannot play an event if it has no legal target. In this case, the legal target must be an exhausted defending Gondor character. Otherwise you cannot ready it.
> The second part of the effect depends on the first part being resolved because it begins with ‘that character’ and that refers to the character who was readied.
> Cheers,

That answer feels good for me, but for about 2 years i asked a similiar question refering to Elwing's Flight [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=2009550], so i asked him again about the differences:

> Quote
> 
> Hi Jan,
> The difference between Elwing’s Flight and Behind Strong Walls is that the ready effect and stat boost are part of the same effect in Elwing’s Flight whereas they are two separate effects on Behind Strong Walls. In order to have a legal target for Elwing’s Flight, you only need a questing character to receive the +1 WP, whereas the way Behind Strong Walls is worded requires that you need an exhausted Gondor defender.
> Cheers,
> Caleb

Ok .. i'm fine with this ruling and guessed it before asking. But one hour later i received a new email from Caleb:

> Quote
> 
> Hi Jan,
> We had a long discussion in the department about your rules question. The long and short of it is that I was basing my ruling off the idea that Behind Strong Walls is targeting an exhausted Gondor defender, but the other guys in the department pointed out that “ready” is the effect and “defending Gondor character” is the target. Basically, it’s written backwards from how I typically write my effects, so I was having a hard time seeing it that way. In any case, I need to revise my previous ruling about Behind Strong Walls. The answer is: “Yes, you can play Behind Strong Walls to give a ready Gondor defender +1 DEF because its only targeting requirement is that the defending character has the Gondor trait.” Sorry for the confusion.
> Cheers,
> Caleb

So .. in the end .. you can play Behind Strong Walls on a defending Gondor-character which is not exhausted... :-(

Seriously stretching here, but Flame of Anor is mildly different in that it explicitly is a COST -> EFFECT wording in its first sentence where you cannot fulfill the EFFECT (in the case of a ready Istari). Behind Strong Walls is being parsed by Caleb here more like hero Sam's Response, where the target of the effect, a defending Gondor character, is undergoing two separate effects: 1. readying, 2. +1 DEF.

Hmm. I think you should not be able to "ready" a ready character. That character must refer to  the character you just readied, which will be no one; therefore leaving no legal target.

I don't see the difference here between FoA and BSW. They both have costs (pay one resource; pay one resource, add to the victory display, and discard the top card) that are payed for to trigger an effect (ready a defending Gondor character, that character gets + defense; ready an Istari, that character gets + attack). In both cases though, I do think the target character must be exhausted (BSW clearly refers to "that character," whereas Sam has two different effects triggering off the engagement).

I can see how Sam and Elwing's Flight (and Lembas) work differently and don't require the target character to be exhausted, though. Thoughts?

The disconnect here may be that, for FoA, you are correct—"that character" refers to the Istari that was readied by the first part of the effect, and the ruling agrees with the general principle that indeed you cannot ready a character that is not exhausted.

But, per Caleb's last ruling above, for BSW, "that character" merely refers to a defending Gondor character. It is as if he is parsing it like the card was written as follows:

> Quote
> 
> Action: Choose a defending Gondor character. Ready that character. That character gains +1 [defense] until the end of the round.

i.e., that it's really two separate effects occurring sort of in parallel.

Why precisely FoA is not treated the same way is, I think we can all agree, rather confusing, but my presumption is that it's the specific "[cost] to [effect]" wording of its 1st sentence. I'd be curious to see how Caleb would respond if pressed on this point.

That's the problem .. Flame of Arnor has the additional costs which makes the "to" important. And so your Istari character has to be exhausted.
I think, i will link Caleb this thread, so he can read it.. and decide.

So .. here is my follow up conversation with Caleb:

> Hi Jan,
> A good number of the rules questions that I get have to do with the intention of a card vs its actual language. I agree with you that the intention of BSW is that you ready the defending character, that is why my initial answer was that the defending character must be exhausted to be a legal target. However, as I examined the language closer with my coworkers, it became clear that the language on the card does not target an ‘exhausted’ defending Gondor character - just a defending Gondor character. Therefore, it is not a requirement that they be exhausted.
> It’s not a surprise to me that I made a past ruling for Flame of Anor that conflicts with my current BSW ruling because it was only after the recent conversation I mentioned that I realized these events do not explicitly target exhausted characters. So I must reverse my FoA ruling as well to say that you can play it on a ready Istari character.

But BSW and FoA don’t use the word ‘then', so readying the target character is not a condition that must be fulfilled in order to trigger the second part of the effect.

Not all of these work. It's not that Caleb ruled that you can ready a ready character; his ruling is about targeting and the applicability of a second sentence using "that character" in compound effects.

Thus, each of your examples that purely ready—e.g., Boromir, Cram, ally Glorfindel—cannot be used as you say, since they have no effect other than to ready some character. Spare Hood shouldn't be valid either, as its second sentence starts with "Then".

In other words, you can't pay the costs to do something if there would be no effect OTHER than the cost payment.

It would indeed be a boost to Narya, Tale of Tinuviel, Taste It Again!, and Boomed & Trumpeted compared to how I'd been playing them, though.

Caleb's explanation above just mentions that Behind Strong Walls can target a ready Gondor character because it doesn't explicitly state that the character needs to be exhausted.  He repeated that point when discussing Flame of Anor, but didn't mention a secondary effect as requisite for that point to remain true.  So currently it seems that you can do all of the things I typed above.  

If your deck is empty, I wonder can you play Mithrandir's Advice?  Same idea here, paying a cost for no effect.

(whoops, you're right, no Cram on allies, but Spare Hood & Cloak and Born Aloft are 0-point attachments that would also work, should we ever see a Dale ally that is returned to hand)

I disagree on your interpretation of Caleb's words, but I'm sending in a specific query to see if you can ready a ready character in lieu of other effects.

> My ruling regarding Behind Strong Walls and Flame of Anor was not to say that you can ready character who is already ready. The ruling I gave was that neither of those cards explicitly target an exhausted character. Both of those cards have additional effects that can be resolved even if the target character is not exhausted. BSW gives +1 DEF and Flame of Anor gives an attack boost. Therefore, both cards have the potential to affect the board even if the target character is not readied.

> If a card’s only effect is to ready a character, then you cannot play it on a ready character because it will not affect the board. So if Boromir is ready,  you cannot raise your threat by 1 to ready him because it has no effect. Similarly, you cannot play Ever Vigilant to ready an ally who is ready because again it has no effect.

Technically, Caleb is NOT saying you can "ready a ready character".  He's just saying that if an action/response affecting a character *includes* readying, you can still do it to a ready character if it does something *else* that affects the character.  BSW doesn't ready a ready Gondor defender, but it still can be played to give a Gondor defender +1 defense.

In fact, Caleb explicitly said If a card’s only effect is to ready a character, then you cannot play it on a ready character because it will not affect the board, which is close to saying you cannot ready a ready character.

This whole set of rulings is in keeping with a previous partial-fulfillment ruling:

(Please note that I am linking only the explicit ruling, not my commentary in that post [which was subsequently shown to be incorrect]. I still don't get the Daeron's Runes ruling lower in that thread and what it means for the semantics of "then", though it is irrelevant to our current discussion.)

## 14 [GrandSpleen on February 16, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76836-behind-strong-walls/?do=findComment&comment=3216324)

No, you can't (Caleb's quoted ruling a few posts above this one makes it clear).
