Heroes Erkenbrand and both ents have an ability which deals damage. The Shirt prevents dealt damage and it's not written that the damage has to be from an attack.

So, is there an official ruling on this? Otherwise Treebeard is a solid 7/8/3/5, Quickbeam can ready roughly twice as much, Erkenbrand gets as good as the un-erata'd Burning Brand was!

Assigned one by one but dealt simultaneously, so (for example) if you have three Silvan Refugees in play, you can spread three archery points amongst them.  Thread here has that example in ruling by Caleb, though the words "one by one" are not used by him:

Are you referring to the sentence that has players divvying up archery damage until there is none left to assign?
