Hey, this is courtesy of the CotR Discord... LordRorthorn there asked a question of Caleb which got an answer that I thought deserved recording for posterity. I reproduce the exchange here with LordRorthorn's blessing.

 



> Hi I have a rules question regarding placing progress on locations and quests that was raised during a game of Thing In The Depths. The first quest stage cannot have any progress placed on it until Helm Of The Stormcaller is in the victory display. If Helm Of THe Stormcaller is the active location, and enough progress is made to clear this location, can excess progress be placed on the quest? Basically, is the active location placed in the victory display as soon as all the progress is placed on it, allowing excess progress to go to the quest, or is all progress placed as one action and then the location is explored/added to the victory display.

And the official response:

 



> The way the core rules describe placing progress from questing successfully is: “Note that if there is an active location, progress tokens are place don that location until it is explored, and the remainder are then placed on the current quest.” Once Helm of the Stormcaller leaves play, you are no longer prevented from placing the remaining progress on stage 1B

While I think that this is how most of us have been playing the quest, there's something odd about this that I can't quite put my finger on. The discussion here -- https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199848-elf-stone-long-defeat/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199848-elf-stone-long-defeat/]-- was about a somewhat different issue of timing re: locations vs. quest cards, but I have a hard time holding both of the rulings in my head at once. Perhaps others have a better framework understanding than I.
