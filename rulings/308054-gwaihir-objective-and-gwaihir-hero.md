If I am running Gwahir Hero and playing Mountain of Fire, and the Gwaihir Objective Ally is revealed from the Encounter Deck, do I have to discard my Gwaihir Hero if the First Player opts to use the When Revealed option that immediately discards the Objective-Ally Gwaihir from play?

I am only saying that uniqueness clashes should be avoided. Caleb designed the black gate/Mt Doom with Gwaihir as an objective ally and this is part of the quest. So I don't think the hero Gwaihir is meant to be played here, because Caleb designed the quest with him as an ally, and one that is meant to be part of the quest. Bringing that particular hero is clashing with a part of the quests mechanics.

I am not trolling EBerling, I am simply saying that if uniqueness clashes were applied in every game, then Gwaihir is not a legitimate option, but only for Black Gate/Mt Doom. He is free game in any other quest though.
