"Feint" and "thicket of spears" will stop an ememy or multiple enimies from attacking "this phase." Does this mean that these events are not resolved and are not discarded until the end of the combat phase?

The reason this is important is it will determine if Hama can attack and get the played feint or spears card back from the discard that phase. I'm assuming because these cards say "this phase" they do not completely resolve until the end of the phase.and therefore Hama would have to wait until the next turn to attack and get it back. This would require a hand with at least 2 feints and/or thickets to stop an attack or multiple attacks every turn.

It is possible that game and quest mechanics (if not now in the future) will allow enimies to attack in the combat phase but in a different step. After the declare attackers step for example. Hypothetically If they ever make a card that has a shadow effect or enemy with a forced effect that reads: "attacking enemy makes a second attack after the 'declare attackers' step then cards like feint and thicket of spears would need to be in play and not completely resolved and descarded until the end of phase. 

Therefore unless someone has something else to offer I'm assuming hama cannont retrieve a feint just played in the action window before declare defenders and attackers in the same round.

i sent an offical rules request for you…….

caleb got back to me in seconds….thanks! here it is

Hi Rich,
Unless an event card says otherwise, it should be discarded as soon as it is played. That would allow Hama to retrieve a Feint just used to prevent an enemy from attacking.
Cheers,
Caleb
