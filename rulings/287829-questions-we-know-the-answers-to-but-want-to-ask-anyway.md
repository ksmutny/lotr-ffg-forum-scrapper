Sometimes we know that just because something isn't explicitly laid out in rules, it's pretty clear what is allowed and not allowed. I figured this might make for some fun laughs but also dig a little deeper into our understanding of the language of the game and point out some important key details.

I'll get us started.

1. If you are playing in Saga mode, and you promote a unique ally to hero using sword thaine or prince imrahils ability, can you add that hero to your pool without incurring the +1 threat penalty?

2. Is the quest phase the only time the encounter deck gets reset unless explicitly told to reset the encounter deck by a card?

3. Does master ironsmith allow you to play guarded cards without guarding? What if the card was guarded, attached, unattached and discarded somehow, and then master ironsmiths ability triggers and you choose the guarded card?

 

Any other game-breaking questions and situations are welcome!

Unfortunately we've had rulings recently which clarify that there isn't a way to 'cheat' guarded cards into play.  The dwarf card 'Well-Equipped' allows you to attach a card to a dwarf in play.  I guess what happens is that the card will enter play attached to the dwarf (?) but then you'll have to get a guarded card, remove your attachment from the dwarf, and attach it to the guard.

In the case of Sting, you would immediately take control of it.

Well, as long as there is no viable card for guarding in the deck, you will get it for fre.

@Rouxxor [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/308704-rouxxor/] are you referring to the travel cost question?

The situation I wrote about, “Travel: Discard until...” was hypothetical, I’m not sure if any card exists like that. Maybe one exists which says “Travel: Shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck and discard until...”.   If that happened, and you still couldn’t find the type of card you were lookjng for, I think maybe you would just travel to the location for “free” (other than the “cost” of discarding cards from the deck). That’s opposite from what I said earlier , I’m not that sure about it.  But the recent ruling about Sting makes me think that way. 

If you play Sting and there is no enemy in the encounter deck, the rules tell you infinitely reshuffle the deck and infinitely discard cards.  Caleb rules that you would do the effect as completely as you could: discard til deck is empty, reshuffle, then discard til empty again. At that point you are sure that there is no matching card type. So, you stop reshuffling and attach Sting to your character. So maybe a travel effect worded in this way would work similarly. 

I don’t think you would reshuffle the encounter deck for that effect though, since it’s during the travel phase. Only if the card actually tells you to do so.
