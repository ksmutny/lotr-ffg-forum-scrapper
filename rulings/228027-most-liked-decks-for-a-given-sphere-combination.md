Using the ringdb "Hall of Fame", these are the highest listed with deck title (with type in bracket if it isn't obvious from the name or heroes) for each combination.  That doesn't mean they're necessarily the most powerful, however.  For a given sphere combination, what heroes/archtype do you think would be the most powerful?

 

Using the abbreviations D - leadership, L - lore, S - spirit, T - tactics

 

DDD LeBoromir, LeDenethor, LeFaramir (Family of Leaders)

DDL LeDenethor, Hirluin, Erestor (The Rapid Charge of Outlands!)

DDS Amarthiul, Elfhelm, SpEowyn (Rohan, meet Dunedain)

DDT LeDenethor, Sam, TaBoromir (Now it's time for... Deorwine) [sword-thain Deorwine, build him up]

DLS Dain, Bifur, Oin (Quad Sphere Dwarf Deck *COTR deckbox*)

DLT Sam, LoPippin, TaMerry (Stings Like a Bee) [hobbit secrecy]

DST LeDenethor, Arwen, TaAragorn (The Grudge) [TaAragorn superhero]

LLL Mirlonde, LoPippin, Rossiel (Become the Forest *CotR deckbox*)

LLD LoAragorn, Damrod, Amarthiul (Dunedain Trappers)

LLS Mirlonde, Rossiel, Galadriel (Victory-a Secret)

LLT --none listed--

> I think the hypothetical most powerful deck would be a deck that has the highest expecting winning percentage against the set of all nightmare quests.  It would take a lot of playing to get even one outing against each quest, though, and probably vastly more to establish a statistically significant difference between two powerful deck.

> It's a good point about the sphere distributions probably not being the best way to look at the problem.  Supposing TaBoromir was part of every "most powerful" tactics configuration, the optimal Boromir deck should have only one sphere combination.

I just cannot help but weigh in here in regards to the "best" or in my honest opinion "broken" player decks we now get from time to time. "I suspect that many of us would be more happy playing a deck that won 75% of the time than one that won 100% of the time, even though the latter deck is definitely more powerful" 

To me this honestly could not be more correct or spot on and I feel like this new generation of decks that are more or less unbeatable are actually somewhat damaging to our amazing game. 

 

Now I expect this to be a fairly unpopular opinion so I understand that I will probably get some negative feedback but that is totally fair enough as this is purely just my opinion and in no way am I trying to present any of this as fact. 

 

Ok let me explain where I am coming from. First off this game is meant to be tough. Even when using a powerful deck (as opposed to a "broken" one) you are not meant to have a 100% or even 90% win rate. Especially when playing more difficult quests. Now it is a solo or co-op game not competitive so obviously people can use whatever deck they want and can handicap themselves or make the game easier as they see fit or use house rules or whatever. Yes we as players can ignore these "broken" decks that sort of borderline cannot lose games (or will only lose against the absolute worst scenario and even then only on occasion).
 
The issue is that the designers can't ignore these decks and have to make new encounter cards and quests based off all the various player decks out there including these ones.....
Nightmare is close to unplayable now unless you use a deck like the one 13Nerv recently posted with Caldara (or one of Seastans unbeatable decks) that allows you to gain incredible amounts of power extremely quickly and by using complex combos that the developers might not have even realised would be possible. I honestly don't think that the developers realised that Caldara would essentially become the tie strongest hero in the game alongside Boromir after they released Elven Light, Arwen, Glorfindel ally and Prince Imrahil ally. I'm sure they wanted to give her some more love/power but the level she is now at is just ridiculous..... especially for an FFG created character that doesn't exist in the source material.... how much better she is than almost every single other hero in the game now is beyond idiotic.... she is a random noble from Gondor that has averagestats, an ability that is meant to be great but with a serious drawback and now she is pretty much hands down the tie most powerful hero.
 
So now nightmare quests and certain other quests (like Dread Realm and Carn Dum) are made with decks like this in mind. Now I know that they don't design the quest specifically so it is still a challenge for decks like these, I know they have to take ALL player decks and strategies into consideration (thematic, weaker decks, stronger decks, "broken" decks, secrecy decks etc) but these decks definitely play a factor and most definitely influence the difficulty and mechanics of future quests to a certain extent. For all those people who don't want to play this sort of deck ever (which honestly I reckon is probably the vast majority of the community) or don't want to have to deck build for every quest ever this just sort of screws us.

Now on top of this the player cards we get these days are definitely no where near as strong as cards we used to get and are FAR MORE based on combos, traits, sphere bleed etc than direct and obvious power or use. This just furthers the gap between decent decks and unbeatable decks. Either use broken combos OR strong cards that in reality are completely mediocre compared to the broken combos. There is just no comparison. 

Now I know that we are meant to find the interactions so that player cards work together to create a strong and reliable player deck but I find these days too many people are discovering game breaking interactions and combos that don't just make cards great but make them next to unbeatable in the right combination. 

 
I used to play nightmare quests and absolutely loved them. The first two cycles were AMAZING. Quests that were usually a walk in the park like Seventh Level became actual challenges. They sort of rose to the same sort of level as actual difficult quests like Return to Mirkwood or Shadow and Flame. Then we get nightmare Heirs of Numenor and the following cycle....

 

Now Heirs and the following cycle are already a hard set of quests so the nightmare quests were always going to be insane but some of them in that cycle (im looking at you amon din and druadan forest!) just became next to impossible.... don't get me wrong I like a challenge and am not opposed to frequent losses but at the same time I want to actually stand a chance of winning and as well as that I don't want to lose on the second or third turn... I want an epic loss halfway through the game or a few turns away from success. This game takes A LOT of setup especially playing two handed with the real cards and having to shuffle the encounter deck, BOTH player decks, reset threat dials etc after only playing a couple of rounds multiple times in a row is just awful and extremely frustrating. I feel like newer nightmare quests  are only truly viable and playable by those using the absolute highest echelon of deck at this point. To be fair I haven't played nightmare in a while and only have to the end of the Ring Maker cycle. Pretty much the entire Ring Maker cycle Nightmare though was just too punishing for me and after a crazy amount of attempts (I'm talking about a LOT of games here) I was able to beat a single quest or maybe 2 out of the cycle and those were ones that are normally among the easier quests of the cycle anyway... Now I don't run the best decks ever but they are pretty goddamn decent and are under constant scrutiny and evaluation. I also come from a MtG background so am well versed in deck building and its finer points.

I really feel like no deck should be able to beat every single nightmare quest over several cycles without any chance of loss or with a near 100% win rate.

They can't make nightmare even harder than it is to stop broken decks achieving this however because if they did normal decks would not stand any chance whatsoever and I already feel like that is the case with certain quests.... I feel like this is a catch 22 that cannot really be rectified at this point.. 
 
Now don't get me wrong I think it is really impressive and being able to find these killer combos obviously shows that these players are very intelligent and are able to figure out these combinations that are so powerful/unbeatable that the rest of us cannot. To me personally however these sorts of decks and mentality are bad for the game rather than good for it. Almost everything is held up to or compared against these sort of decks now... and nothing else comes even close to their power level. 
It is just far too much of a divide between a really strong deck and a more or less unbeatable one. 
If any quest is generally considered too tough for the community its like "oh well use one of Seastan's decks and you'll be alright". I also want to make it clear I don't blame anyone that makes these decks for this situation. The responsibility is on the designers for either not playtesting cards enough or being aware but not caring if this was the case.

I used to be SO AGAINST errata but these days I am actually super for it. I wish blood AND fire both got errata and honestly I think Caleb's ruling of Prince Imrahil working as an extra hero for Caldara's ability is the single worst rules decision/answer we have EVER received and we have had some weird ones. (I still love you though Caleb! Never stop making the worlds greatest game! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ).

 

I know this sort of just appears like and sounds like "oh no the game and nightmare specifically is getting harder and my particular decks aren't as good anymore boo hoo" but honestly that is not the case. The simple fact I constantly update my decks with new player cards and am still able to consistently beat the majority of quests proves that this is not the case. It is only a select few quests and nightmare quests that I feel the issue lies in and am just worried this will get worse. Hell even super difficult saga quests are fine because a) you can collect some truly powerful boons along the way b) you can avoid most burdens, c) you have an extra hero in play (fellowship sphere, who can also help pay for neutral cards like Gandalf may I add!) and d) they are representing some of the most thrilling, intense and potentially catastrophic events from the source material so it makes sense for them to be hard. I know that it is only a select few quests that this is affecting but I really want to beat tougher quests without running an unbeatable deck and I want to be able to play nightmare again!

 

I also don't really understand the point of playing decks that COMPLETELY trivialise the game. To me there isn't really any point playing the game if there is 0% or even less than 5% chance you are going to lose. What exactly are you achieving by bludgeoning the encounter deck over the head so hard that it will never beat you no matter what it does? 
Obviously it must be really cool (and a very proud moment) to create a deck that works that well and is so abusable like that and once again kudos to those that do but after that first game why ever play that quest with that particular deck ever again...? I know that to some the game and each quest are just a puzzle that needs solving and once solved can be won without fail if you use the correct "solution" but I feel like there are far more people that don't want to "solve the puzzle" every time and instead want to grasp victory from the jaws of defeat, have thrillingly close wins and/or demolish the quest but ONLY once they get going and overcome the initial hurdles rather than before they even start the first quest phase. Also I feel like the majority of players want to be able to play a quest with the same deck and have fairly different results and a different level of challenge each time rather than it being more or less the same every time you play it. 
 
To sum up I feel like these broken decks that so few players use are affecting the difficulty and mechanics that we get/will get in certain quests especially nightmare releases. As well as this the difference in strength between normal power decks and these uberdecks is just far too much. They barely even compare.. 
Nightmare is just unplayable for me at this point and now I feel like I have wasted a fair bit of money trying to keep up to date with Nightmare products but because I love the art and mechanics so much and am fairly obsessed with this game I don't see myself not buying them anymore either... 

AGAIN one last time I understand that you can choose to just not play with these decks or make the game easier but I feel like there is a very large group of the community that do not want to use broken decks and want to use normal ones but also do not want to get absolutely crushed without any chance by certain quests or ANYTHING nightmare and also do not want to be forced to play easy mode (I refuse to do this and am getting so sick of this being the main go to answer when a quest is too hard for a deck/decks that honestly should at least stand a chance but do not, "have you tried easy mode?" NO, NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY EASY MODE!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]). 

Essentially I just want Nightmare quests to be at an achievable level again..... and hope we never see another quest like Carn Dum again.. the majority of players do not use these broken/uber decks so please don't give us quests that more or less require we use them... 
 
Or perhaps I am completely out of touch at this point and the majority of people both use and love these new types of decks...?
 
I just feel like player card power creep has more or less stopped and we now instead have a few more or less unbeatable combos that people have discovered but encounter card power creep has not stopped at all and has instead ramped up.. but not for all quests.. only for certain ones and for all nightmare quests so we now get quests that are either extremely hard or quite easy but few in the middle and player decks that are either average/strong or next to unbeatable with nothing in the middle.

I hope this all made sense...
