Hi all. Do you like broken decks, infinite loops and completely dominating games of Lord of the Rings LCG? Then you are in the right place! Because we're talking about the most busted combo since the Zigil Miner deck. In fact, in my opinion this is way worse than the Zigil Miner deck but I'll let you judge for yourself.


 


Now, to start off, I did not find this combo. That well-deserved credit, as far as I know, goes to alogos on the BGG forums (alogos3 here). Give him geekgold if you see him on BGG. He posted about an infinite loop and said: "If you want to access this dark and forbidden knowledge that ruins the game, PM me." Curious, I sent a PM and got a legit reply. After laughing a bit, sharing the combo with my friend (The Janitor on here) and us joking about hilarious ways to abuse it, and reading comments like this: "There is no five card combo that breaks a game. Sorry, building up a five card combo takes too much effort in and of itself, particularly in a game like this." we decided we wanted to try it out. This is then simply the deck I built around the combo.


 


Anyway, let's get to it:


 


The Deck


 


Beravor


Bilbo Baggins


Thalin


 


Erebor Hammersmith 3x


Master of Lore 3x


Master of the Forge 3x


Gleowine 3x


Miner of the Iron Hills 2x


Longbeard Map-Maker


Warden of Healing


Haldir of Lorien


Gildor Inglorion


Gandalf 3x


 


Legacy of Durin 3x


Horn of Gondor 3x


Born Aloft 3x


Steward of Gondor


Song of Kings


Song of Travel


 


Daeron's Runes 3x


Peace, and Thought 3x


Lorien's Wealth 3x


Will of the West 2x


Wealth of Gondor 2x


Parting Gifts


Out of the Wild


Blade Mastery 2x

The Breakdown of Parts


 


Heroes


 


Beravor-For drawing.


Bilbo Baggins-For drawing. Start yourself as player one.


Thalin-You need a dwarf hero, and Tactics color for the combo. Thalin is also less threat than Gimli, which is better to hopefully keep enemies off of you early.


 


To be clear, our games are almost exclusively two or three player games. That's where this deck and combo works the best. The other players' jobs are basically to stall until you lock into the combo. I was sending Bilbo and Thalin questing every turn (for a whopping help of two! Oh and Thalin's ability.) but that was basically it. It was up to my friends to quest, defend, attack, etc. although all they really have to do is make it a few turns, stopping things from getting so bad that you lose in those first few turns or that attacks or things get through to this deck. Any of these three heroes dying will severely damage the probability of getting the combo up, in play and done quickly. I'll let my friend post up his deck if he wants to, but his main parts to help do these companion deck tasks were: a Spirit/Tactics deck with Eowyn, Eleanor and Hama (hopefully with Feint early). Beregond was also involved in the three player games to sentinel block for me.


 


The Combo


 


Erebor Hammersmith 3x


Master of Lore 3x


Legacy of Durin 3x


Horn of Gondor 3x


Born Aloft 3x


 


So, if it's not obvious to you what you need to do: Get out Legacy of Durin on Thalin and Horn of Gondor on Beravor as quick as possible. My friends' decks also ran copies of these two attachments to help us get them up faster. Then play Master of Lore and name "Lore Allies" to cost one cheaper. Now you can play Erebor Hammersmith for one, draw a card from Durin's Legacy, play Born Aloft on Hammersmith, use Born Aloft to send Hammersmith back to hand, gain a resource from Horn of Gondor, and repeat. Hammersmith gets you the Born Aloft back from the top of your discard pile, so, you can do this infinitely to immediately draw your entire draw deck once you hit the combo in your planning phase.


 


Drawing Cards Stuff


 


Master of the Forge 3x-Really awesome since three of the cards in the combo are attachments.


Gleowine 3x


Gildor Inglorion


Gandalf 3x


Daeron's Runes 3x


Peace, and Thought 3x-Ridiculous card.


Lorien's Wealth 3x


 


Beravor is two more cards for you each turn. This may seem like a lot of cards dedicated to drawing but I wouldn't change that at all. It doesn't matter how many slots are for this, it is the single most important thing. All you have to do is find those five cards, so we need to draw away. Peace and Thought is insane. There's games where you'll draw your 6 card starting hand, mulligan if it's not good, draw 2 more cards from start of turn and Bilbo and 2 more from Beravor, and then if one of those 10 is a Peace and Thought, have drawn 15 cards on turn 1. So, to that guy who said "There is no five card combo that breaks a game." and "building up a five card combo takes too much effort in and of itself, particularly in a game like this." you would be wrong. VERY wrong. Not only is this VERY doable but on average we were hitting the combo on about turn three and have even pulled it off as early as turn two. About the only thing that might stop you from doing it that quick often is resources but even that there are ways to help. Hopefully you get Horn of Gondor up early. Or a friend finds one of his Steward of Gondors to play on you. My friend also ran Miruvors to give me an extra resource quickly some games, plus you might be able to use your two extra Born Alofts (after you draw your whole deck) on your friend's allies to trigger Horn of Gondor a couple extra times. Also if your friends find their copies of Legacy of Durin or Horn of Gondor to play on you that will save you some. Try to save as many resources as you can but obviously work to find the combo. Mulligan at the start if you don't have at least two of the combo pieces. 


 


Infinite Resources Tricks


 


Song of Kings


Steward of Gondor


Wealth of Gondor 2x


Parting Gifts




Song of Travel


Will of the West 2x



 


Now that you've drawn your whole deck, here's where things really go off the rails. Once you draw your whole deck, hopefully you have enough resources to play Song of Kings on Beravor, who then can pay for Steward of Gondor, to make her Gondor trait. Or maybe your friend found his Steward of Gondors to play on you. Now you can play Wealth of Gondor 2x on her to gain two resources, then pay one to play Song of Travel on her and one for Will of the West to shuffle the 2x Wealth of Gondors back into your deck. Pause to do your Hammersmith/Born Aloft bounce trick twice more to get the Wealths back, play them both again, repeat for a net gain of one resource each time. Repeat until you have infinite resources on Beravor. Now play Parting Gifts to move infinite resources to another hero on the table, Will of the West, Hammersmith/Born Aloft, repeat until every hero on the table has infinite resources. Now find your Lorien's Wealths again and loop those infinitely as well on the other players so that they can also all draw their whole decks. Depending on turn order the other players may or may not be able to play all of their characters and attachments like you but if not they'll be joining all of yours next turn.


 


Other Ridiculousness


 


Longbeard Map-Maker- Um, him plus infinite resources pretty much takes care of questing…


Haldir of Lorien-Ranged/sentinel plus Blade Mastery trick in Combat Phase covers an attack/defend for an emergency on your friends if the turn order on the combo turn made them not be able to get their allies out just yet.


Warden of Healing-Infinite heals to everyone.


Out of the Wild-This is just ridiculous. Infinite plays of this equals almost nothing left in the Encounter deck. Some quests it leaves nothing or like only a couple cards…


Blade Mastery 2x-you can play this infinitely on every character in play in the Combat Phase, soo attack and defense are covered. Also useful for the Siege/Battle Heirs of Numenor quests.


 


Now everyone has their whole deck in their hand and has infinite resources. You can now do basically anything you want. Aside from the last couple of tricks here, there's a BUNCH more stuff you can do and loop infinitely, I just let my friend include these other tricks to lighten the deck load. You'll have to loop Will of the Wests/Lorien's Wealths on the other deck so that they can keep doing their stuff infinitely as well. Some of the best: obviously The Galadhrim's Greeting to reduce everyone's threats to 0. The Riddermark's Finest to clear every location in play. Hail of Stones/Grim Resolve or similar damage tricks to clear every enemy in the staging area. Tactics Boromir/Fortune or Fate to kill every enemy NOT in the staging area. Fortune or Fate to get all heroes back that died in stalling for you. What's almost funny is you'll find a lot of stuff isn't even necessary. I mean, do you even need to kill every enemy in play with events when you have basically infinite attack/defense characters? Do you even need more than a few allies now that you have infinite events to do basically everything?  It's really your choice which tricks to include and which ones become simply arbitrary.


 


Miner of the Iron HIlls 2x- This guy just is for if some of those stupid attachment treacheries make it onto any characters. Also they are other cheap dwarves you can use with Durin's Legacy in an emergency for a couple extra card draws if you're having trouble finding the main combo cards.


 


~~~


 


So there it is. If everything went well, on about turn three you drew your whole deck, gave every player's heroes infinite resources, let all players draw their whole deck, dropped everyone's threats to 0, eliminated all locations and enemies in (at least) the staging area, eliminated almost the entire Encounter deck, played every one of your allies and attachments (and depending on turn order, your friend's allies/attachments), plus other tricks.


 


Obviously there might be some games where you don't hit the combo and then everything goes to hell. But it hasn't happened yet. And as long as you don't actually lose the game, you can always pull all the way back once you do hit the combo. Your scores will be ridiculous too, and are only limited by the +10 points per round rules. Our best scores right now are a 13 on Into the Pit and a -3 on BATTLE FOR LAKE-TOWN. With the new scoring system even. I didn't even know you could enter a negative score but the quest log lets you and even says "use negative numbers if needed". *Shrug*. There's a few quests that could still be problematic but almost all of them you will destroy. Ironically, the Battle for Lake-town, the hardest quest available, is probably the best one for scores with this because of all the victory points. You just have to hopefully not hit like the 'attack everyone' Smaug or other bad stuff early in that quest.


 


I'm not quite sure how this will do solo. It probably depends on the quest. Obviously it will be harder, especially for early resources and blocking, but maybe still doable on many quests as long as you can survive. I'm not sure what I would cut to fit some of the other infinite loop trick cards though. Hilariously you don't even have to quest very hard (or at all!) as long as you find the combo before you hit 50 threat.


 


My main motivation for posting this, honestly, is to just bring awareness to the combo and to FFG. I kind of hate errata but obviously something here needs fixed. I'd hate to start going to those new game store events in January when the game night kits come out only to see this combo everywhere. It would kind of put a damper on the premiere of game night events right off the bat, in my opinion.


 


What part should they even fix though? Legacy of Durin? Master of Lore since he seems like something that could be abused later on as well? Wealth of Gondor, though I think you could then still maybe do an infinite resource loop then with 3x errata'ed Zigil Miners, Lure of Moria and Will of the West once your deck is out. What also scares me is that certain other parts of this might end up being broken on their own without the combo. Mainly Wealth of Gondor. Like, you can easily draw through 15 cards on turn 1 with a Peace and Though and if you hit a second Peace and Thought in those 15, you could be through 23 cards by turn 2 without playing any other drawing cards or Daeron's Runes or other players playing drawing cards on you. 23 cards! That's almost half your deck. And this is post-Beravor errata. If we can get through our deck any faster with future cards, Wealth of Gondor 2x/Will of the West infinite resources trick will be ridiculous on it's own and you won't even need the Hammersmith parts.


 


Sorry if I over explained some stuff here. I really just wanted to make sure everyone, veteran or apprentice alike, was fully aware of what this deck is capable of. I'm honestly surprised more people aren't talking about this yet.


 


Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts. I'm sure some of you might even see ways to improve the deck and make it even more stupid, hah. Maybe my friend will post his deck as well, so you can at least see our version of a companion stall deck.


 


Enjoy!

Yes, I remember when Decipher announced that rule.  It made sense.  So did giving eratta to Far-Seeing Eyes to make it unique, which I think was announced at about the same time.  The "Rule of 4" just felt a little clunky, since you had to keep track of how many cards you had drawn that phase.  Thankfully, 4 is a rather small number, so it wasn't that big of a deal.

I still prefer a hand cap, since you don't have to keep track of anything in the past.  You only have to count the cards in your hand at the exact moment you activate a draw ability and see if you are allowed to draw.



Yes the good old times of Decipher……….I remember first Lotr world cup in Essen 2002. I was there with my country team……Good time!

Anyway hand cap is the good decision i agree with you. Sometimes is also geting weird when i play with my friend who love to play lore and Beravur and in the middle of the game he had more cards in his hand then in his player deck. And then he say : i can cancel this treachery let me check i should to have a Test of will somewhere here and it take a 10 second to just look to his hand. And after he play dwarfen tomb to get Test if will back to his hand. And from this moment i start to feel crazy boring cose i understand game is won 100% and is only matter of time and from this moment a game is just burden. NON change it! Now is not same every thing much more hard and i love it! Really waiting and like the idea of the new nightmare sets for the old quests to make them replayable with strong current decks.

Will see what Caleb will do now with all this issues.
