Just saw all the cards on HallofBeorn and am dying to see how the quests are, Journey in the Dark looks brutal. Anybody who has played these quests tell me your initial opinions just to tide me over till I get the expansion haha thanks.

I want to play the quest like other quests i don't want to alter my deck to finish the Balrog off. I just can't get around his monstrous defense, it would be no problem at all if he weren't Immune to player card effects, there's just no way that i can get enough attacking power to kill him. He doesn't lose his immunity to card effects when i sacrifice a Hero on the bridge does he?

This sounds very familiar! I started out with Glorfindel, Aragorn & Gandalf and also was not able to put enough damage on the Balrog. Direct damage effects would have been nice but Caleb ruled that the Balrog does not lose its immunity to player card effects after sacrificing a hero.

 

After two weeks of trying out different things now and then, I finally had my breakthrough yesterday with Gimli as the main attacker. If you collect 3 copies of Khazad, Khazad! and get a Citadel Plate plus enough damage on him, he is a true killing machine. The successful victory over a Balrog actually made me wonder why some people on this forum think he was outdated and useless. I posted my complete deck here: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1256656/mostly-thematic-approach-defeat-balrog [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1256656/mostly-thematic-approach-defeat-balrog] (there are some allies in it that make it somewhat unthematic but they are not meant to participate in combat, so maybe you will be fine with that as well :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]).

Gimil is still a great choice if you really just need to hulk someone up to take on a big baddie. He's also great against Smaug, for example.

Would be a really cool and thematic option. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I thought the Balrog only looses his indestructible keyword after you explore the bridge, but that he is still immune against player card effects...?!?

 

ETA: Just read the thread a bit further and realized that Caleb already confirmed that it's not possible.
