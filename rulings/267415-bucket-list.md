Things are pretty quiet around here, so what are some things we'd like to see in the next cycle/before the game ends (news flash, not happening for awhile!)? Here's mine in no particular order.

1. another hero Sam

2. more support for Leadership/Tactics Noldor

3. more Istari, Palantiri, etc.

4. Scouring of the Shire PoD

5. stonger, big Gondor allies

6. FFG deck-boxes

7. nightmare versions of Gen Con/Fellowship Event quests:P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

What say ye?

That seems to be FFG's (maybe partially Asmodee's?) biggest problem: lack of enthusiasm and activity (pertaining to the community) for their games. Their promotion, organized play, and news releases have usually seemed half-hearted to me. They often end up redoing games (Star Wars, AGoT, Netrunner). -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png] That said, Caleb and Matt are the happy exception, and I think FFG is a good company on the whole.

Maybe we're speaking too soon. After all, we've got a whole cycle ahead that has the chance to give us everything on our lists. At any rate, if you developers are reading this, you guys are doing great! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Well, you can already start forgetting about that. Apparently Caleb thought that for the Harad cycle orcs and wargs were more important than, you know, stuff specific to Harad.

Really?
