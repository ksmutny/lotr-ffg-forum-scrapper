Considering the trait and theme, it would be great if we had at least some minor resource acceleration so Harbor Master can have some new life blown into him. Or he was a dud and should've been part of the discard mechanic. Time will tell. Matt and Caleb keep coming up with such awesome ideas, so I have every faith in this. So much to look forward to now!

This.

 

Oh man what a theme! Just got one word: fantastic.

 

Love the boat mechanic and how it works different from traveling by foot.

 

Caleb, Matt & team have outdone themselves this time.

Does anyone know if parts of Númenor are still above sea level in the lore or whether Matt and Caleb are taking some liberties? I know some places in Beleriand remain in the Third Age, but I had the impression Númenor was completely underwater. It's an awesome idea either way - I guess they won't throw in actual Númenoreans as allies or heroes, but there's plenty of opportunity for events and attachments that refer back to their lost civilisation.
