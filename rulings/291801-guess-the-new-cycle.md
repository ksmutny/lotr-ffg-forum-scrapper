With the last adventure of this cycle announced, I hope the new cycle announcement cannot be so far off. And given the promise both Thorin Stonehelm and Gildor Inglorion will be released, I assume there shall be another cycle.

So, the fun times, what are the predictions? As I said elsewhere, I guess, or hope mostly, the two blue wizzards will be in the big box, though they may not be able to name them Alatar and Pallando (I hope I got those right). And perhaps we shall visit the East since we have been to the South already. It seems like the last place to go before retracing our steps...

I have more wishes but I will save them for the discussion (should there be any); one however I will say now: please, let us have Tom Bombadil! The encounter player card seems a perfect fit for him, with a player card (a song, Hey Tom Bombadillo, perhaps) to place it into the encounter deck.

I love how so many people now speak of new Istari and palantiri. I remember when it was mostly me. Maybe Caleb will listen now!

I think if the deluxe is set in the shire it could open up some different type of quests for Caleb. I’m picturing something that breaks the mold - like a quest around Bilbo trying to get to The Green Dragon Inn while trying to avoid the Sackville-Baggins.

Then my Rohan deck, led by Eomer, murders the Sackville-Baggins’.
