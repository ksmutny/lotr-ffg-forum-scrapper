Simple question: can songs (battle, kings, wisdom and travel) save a hero from the damage of The Master's Malice (HoN 60) ? Or is 'gaining a ressource icon' not the same as 'belonging to a sphere of influence' ?

 

For example, let's say I have a spirit hero with a song of battle attached to him. When I choose tactics for the 'The Master's Malice' effect does that spirit hero takes 3 damage or not ?

You have added the word "printed" yourself -- it doesn't appear in the passage you have quoted.  Shouldn't do that, as the word "printed" is used in a very specific way when it appears in the rules.

 

Alogos is correct, this was clarified by Caleb awhile back:

 

"That's a good question. Since the resource icon indicates which sphere a hero belongs to, if a hero gains an additional resource icon from a card effect, then the hero will belong to that sphere as well. That will allow you to combo cards like Good Meal with the song cards.

Cheers,

Caleb"

 

And that's in this thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/84466-sphere-match/?hl=%2Bgood+%2Bmeal].
