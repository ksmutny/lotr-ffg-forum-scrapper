I have been playing this game since the core set released, and am of  the opinion that the single biggest mistake the designers of this game have made is the "Steward of Gondor" card. I've been thinking about this for a long time, but the thought "bubbled back up" the other day while listening to the COTR podcast guys speculate about the potential need to errata "Blood of Gondor" and "Gondorian Fire". It amazed me that nobody seemed to recognize that the root of the problem underneath these two, and many other resource generated effect cards... is SOG. I've also noted that a lot of the more well known community deck builders, like Seastan and Ataruslash, seem to be hooked on it like it's cocaine, and  barely have the ability to make a deck without it. This isn't a slam on them, but rather a slam on a card design that makes 1 card so central to virtually every power deck ever built.

From the very beginning I've struggled with this card. It's offensive to one's sense of theme to constantly have to justify how Amarthiul, or Celeborn is suddenly the Steward of Gondor. It only took me a few plays before I became bored with including it in every deck, as it's so up-front overpowered and has no subtlety to it at all. It almost takes an entire consideration element, resource generation/management, out of the game once it hits the table. 

 I feel that I have been forced to play it as the lynchpin behind so many decks all of these years, that I almost can't stand to play it anymore... and yet I still feel pressured to because all of the newest scenarios released seem to assume a SOG driven resource power curve. It's part of the reason why they have struggled to bring the "Gondor" themed trait to maturity... because the biggest distinct perk that the Gondor archetype has (resource generation and hero defense) is applicable to everybody thanks to one OP card (along with a free Gondor trait to boot!). It is so blatantly powerful, that it changes the game, sort of similar to how a black hole warps gravity within it's vicinity... to where it in and of itself is an integral mechanic of the game an not just a card.

The sad thing is, it would be the world's easiest card to errata and fix ALL of these problems. One simply has to replace "gains Gondor trait" with "play on a hero with the Gondor trait". Boom. It fixes the thematic problem, it somewhat mitigates the power problem (now you atleast have to play "In service of the Steward" before abusing it in every power deck you make), AND it actually gives the Gondor archetype something to build around as a distinct contribution to deck building. Suddenly not just every deck can make use of nearly infinite resources and "Gondorian Shields". These actually become special things that require the Gondor archetype as atleast a sub-theme.

It's incredible how they won't touch the obvious offender, and yet they'll completely nerf an otherwise interesting card like "Master of Lore" in an attempt to stop one obscure combo that only people interested in exploiting and breaking the game are going to play anyway... and not even the most offensive card in this combo!

Curious to the thoughts of other long time players? I really think deck building would be far more interesting and balanced if SOG were errata'd.

> I'll admit that it requires a little themeblindness to have SOG in my Sam deck, however I think limiting it to only gondor takes away one of its most thematic uses. When Aragorn arrives in Minas Tirith he gets the resources of gondor and becomes "one of them".

This is precisely why we have "In Service of the Steward". In fact, this card is a living illustration of what this game is missing as far as a defined "Gondor" trait. This would normally be a heavy sought after card if it was actually required to give heroes a Gondor synergy as well as play SOG. No other trait splasher (Elf-Friend, Nor am I a Stranger, etc.) is 0 cost while having an ability that represents the best of it's trait synergy. 

Honestly, this thread has influenced my view on SOG. I get the arguments of how it might be necessary in solo play against the hardest scenarios, how it's less effective with more players, that there are more good resource generating options every cycle to atleast decrease the absolute dependence on it, and how a card like this might be necessary in a Core box deck for new players. I still think that they could have toned down it's OP'ness a "little" bit.... a good suggestion being coming into play exhausted....but I get the "pro" arguments.

I've come to realize that I could probably live with it's power as long as nobody who uses it ever complains about the game being too easy. (seriously, every time somebody complains about the game being too easy, I go and look at their decks and see SOG with all the same power cards! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

I think now the part that really offends me the most is the "attached character gains Gondor trait" part. Even just deleting this line from the card altogether would be a vast improvement....as it would still give away Gondor's best resource generator to all archetypes but it wouldn't give away the Gondor synergy for free (i.e. Gondorian Shield, Wealth of Gondor, etc). Dain in a dwarf deck or Elrohir in a ninja deck would cease being the epitome of the Gondor archetype.

I mean, what was the thought process behind it? 

"Man, this card is not game breaking OP'ed enough, lets allow it to give away the Gondor synergy for free to give it a boost"? Honestly, as experimental as this game design was, they probably had no clue what it was going to look like in reaching maturity, and should probably be forgiven this. That's sort of how "first of their type" designs work.... lot's of inevitable design mistakes and learning points.

Actually, I have a theory that the designers secretly agree with most of what I've been saying. I think that somewhere around the HoN deluxe, when Caleb and Matt were taking over and trying to develop a Gondor synergy, somebody took a second look at the core cards and thought "oh.......crap". I think they realized how the design of SOG cramped their Gondor (and resource generation) design space, but decided to roll with it anyway since it was already so integral to the game at that point... and they have been fighting it ever since. 

In COTR's 100th episode, the designers were asked if there were any cards they regretted, and it was pretty obvious from the answer that there was. Of course, they didn't talk about it as is only professional, but what they "didn't" say really said it all.

I have no doubt what card is at the top of their list, and I have full confidence that when the LOTR LCG 2.0 reboot hits, any SOG equivalent will be a lot more toned down and balanced from the outset. However, if my theory is correct, that also means that it is highly unlikely that they will ever errata it at this point in the game.... even if they secretly agree with me. They will continue to try to boost the Gondor trait, continue to find other creative means of resource generation to help "soften the blow" of SOG on the meta.

 

To me, it's very obvious that Leadership Denethor was designed "specifically" to be the target of SOG... and thus tie it back in to Gondor decks in the meta. By releasing an extremely powerful Gondor hero that is the perfect target for SOG, they practically ensure that people show up to groups with Denethor decks that tie up SOG. It's actually probably the most brilliant move that they could have made to correct the meta without outright errata.

OK, I'll amend Horn to "niche card" instead of coaster.  If you chump-block as a strategy (or share a table with someone who does) it's a good card.  If you're playing a direct damage quest that's likely to destroy (not discard!) characters, it's a good card.  If neither applies, it's not worth the 1-cost or the restricted slot for a card that may never generate resources.  I dropped Horn out of my tactics deck when I replaced Winged Guardian with Defender of Rammas.

 

I'll also concede that Horn of Gondor was an essential part of the loop (though not the *only* essential part) that led to the unfortunate Master of Lore nerf.  Horn of Gondor was not errata-ed at that time, even though an exhaustion cost for Horn of Gondor would have solved the problem while still retaining its original function.

 

Speaking of original function, I'm not sure I buy the line that the nerf returns HoG to its "intended" function.  Horn of Gondor's "leave play" ability was particularly valuable to three archtypes -- Eagles, Rohan, and Silvan.  Silvan have *lots* of tools to exploit leaves play, and even without the Horn are plenty powerful.  Rohan and Eagles aren't on anyone's overpowered list, and many of the key cards for both came out in the *first cycle*.  Eagles are expensive, and I'm sure the designers *fully intended* for Horn of Gondor to recover some of the costs from those disappearing Eagles.

 

In 2016 when announcing the errata, Caleb Grace writes: 

 

Horn of Gondor has an important place in The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, particularly in the Core Setexperience. The Tactics player is usually expected to engage enemies and defend their attacks in order to defeat them, but this often means that their allies are destroyed by those enemy attacks. Therefore, it is important to the Tactics player to have a way of gaining resources in order to play more allies to replace those losses. Horn of Gondor provides those resources by giving the attached hero a resource whenever a character leaves play. However, because its Response triggers “After a character leaves play…” instead of “After a character is destroyed…” it left its ability open to all types of abuses. The design team has corrected this by changing Horn of Gondor to read:“Response: After a character is destroyed, add 1 resource to attached hero’s pool.” We believe this errata balances the Horn of Gondor in the game while preserving its original intended use.

 

But back in 2013, a second breakfast by Caleb Grace appears here:

 

https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/3/19/second-breakfast/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/3/19/second-breakfast/]

 

It's a spirit/tactics deck with 2x Horn of Gondor, and he recommends Horn of Gondor as one of five cards he uses for his mulligan decision, since it's his only source of resources.  Is that because of it's "original intended use?"

 

Potential chump blockers:

2x Gondorian Spearman

3x Envoy of Pelargir

 

Anti-chump defense:

2x Arwen Undomiel

3x Defender of Rammas

3x Great Yew Bow

3x Hands Upon the Bow

3x Feint

3x Light in the Dark

 

Leaves play:

3x Gandalf

3x Escort from Edoras

 

Seems to me the "intended use" relies on the original wording in this case, and likely many others.
