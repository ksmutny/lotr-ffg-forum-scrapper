It has not been officially stated in an FAQ or publication, but Caleb mentioned this to me (and others) at Gen Con. I'm sure it will be covered in the next FAQ and you should feel fully comfortable playing it this way, as the intention is to be able to freely change your heroes and it was mistakenly left off the campaign card.

May I?

 

I asked Caleb about Poisonous Councils a while ago, and here is the answer he gave me:

 

> When playing campaign mode, boons that you have earned are considered part of your deck before you even set up the game. So it is possible to draw boons in your opening hand.
> Burden cards with both encounter and player card backs are considered part of the encounter deck and do not get shuffled in until you build the encounter deck (which comes after building your player deck and choosing your heroes). So it is not possible to draw a burden card with a player back into your opening hand.
