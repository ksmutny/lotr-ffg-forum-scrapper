Hello everyone on the forums!

It's been a while since I've dropped an announcement here, but I figured I wanted to cast as wide a net as possible for community comment. The White Tower blog has started up another new project, in collaboration with the Card Talk podcast.

By way of introduction, the project started with me meditating on some of the underpowered cards in the game from the Core Set and early cycles (sparked by a segment or three from Cardboard of the Rings), and wondering what it would take to make them a competitive choice when compared to the full modern card pool. From there, it has grown entirely out of control into a full-blown project to examine every card from the early life of the game, evaluate whether or not the card needs to be boosted in order to put it on even ground in the modern meta, and then offer adjusted versions of those cards. Along the way, if we meet any particularly egregiously overpowered or meta-warping cards, we'll be toning them down just a little bit as well.

We'll be doing a series of blog posts with accompanying YouTube videos going through each of these cards, in bite size chunks of around 8-12 cards per post/video.

The first one is already up: Core Set Leadership Cards [https://thewhitetower.wordpress.com/2019/07/05/ancient-mathoms-core-set-leadership/]

While the Tactics cards are already finalized, and the video has already been recorded (to be posted Friday), we are still inviting community comment on the Spirit cards from the Core Set.

I think so. It is one of the very few resource acceleration cards in Lore, and I like that. I feel like a case could be made theme-wise either way, but I'm going to go with the option that result in the smaller change to the card. We actually haven't changed the sphere of any card we've touched yet, and for this project, that might be a little bit too far. (If you'd like to play with it as neutral though, I'd love to hear a play report and see how it goes!)

Sure. Top 10 is probably a better call. Searching the whole deck might step on the Rivendell Minstrel's toes (and I'd love keep her and Love of Tales relevant in a song deck). But 10 is a good middle ground, I think. If it searched the whole deck, I'd agree that it would have to be a song not in play. But with just the top 10, I'm ok with finding another copy of Love of tales with the enters play response.

------------------------------------------------

It's been a week since the last set of Ancient Mathoms cards dropped, and I think between all the feedback, we've gotten to a good place with them. Of course, only playtesting will reveal that for sure, but we've gotten as far as theorycrafting can get.

So, of course, that means that it's time to wrap up Season 2 of the Ancient Mathoms project with the cards from the Foundations of Stone and Shadow and Flame APs!

We are reaching the end of our (very short) nerf list for the Ancient Mathoms project. After this, there's only 2 cards left, and probably everyone can guess what they are! (Actually, I think that it's upthread, so I'll just note it here - Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire)

But before that, there are 3 more cards from this cycle to get the nerf.

Spirit Glorfindel, of course, is the poster child for overpowered heroes. 5 threat for 3 willpower and 3 attack is incredible. However, the real problem with Glorfindel is not his low threat - his negative ability balances that out. The problem is that he came in a pack with an attachment that allows you to completely negate the negative ability with no downside. Our solution is to not let the ability be turned off. He's still ridiculously good, but you have to deal with his ability instead of just playing Light of Valinor and forgetting about it.

Asfaloth is an extremely powerful card. Repeatable 2 progress on any location is an incredible ability - in fact, Caleb has mentioned in an interview that he feels it's more overpowered than the Northern Tracker, because it can clear a 4-quest point location in a single round (using Asfaloth a second time in the refresh phase). We have 2 options to tone it down. The first is to drop it down to just a single progress - taking the non-Glorfindel ability and making it universal. To compensate, we give the attached hero +1 willpower.

The other option is to keep the 2 progress and spread it across multiple locations.

Finally, the king of overpowered cards. Vilya. There's a good reason that Vilya decks are the most powerful in the game - free cards regardless of cost can build up a board state incredibly rapidly. The problem is that there isn't a good nerf available without completely rewriting the card. Our solution was to make it cost a resource when you put the card into play - it at least makes it cost a little more when you put that 5-cost ally into play. Still totally worth it for 1 resource, but now you have to weigh keeping the resource on Elrond to use it.

Now lets get on to the main attractions - cards newly minted to give them fresh relevance in the modern card pool.

First up, the Lore attachment Healing Herbs. Exhausting a hero is not worth it to get one-time healing, even if it is to full. (Except perhaps in an emergency). We added an ability to exhaust the card to heal 1 point of damage. For a free card, it's still quite good, even if it's not in the same class as warden of healing or daughter of the nimrodel (our version, of course).

Next is the Trollshaw Scout. We gave him a willpower, boosted his attack to 3, and gave him the ability to attack while exhausted, paralleling the Watcher of the Bruinen (and the later Lindon Navigator).

We Are Not Idle got hit hard with the nerf bat. We pulled back a little on that - letting you exhaust any character but limiting the total amount to 3 resources. We also limited the card draw to triggering if you actually exhaust a character, to pull back from the auto-include outside of Dwarf decks just for the thinning.

Next are 2 events that got our standard secrecy treatment. Both were waaay overcosted outside of secrecy, but decent inside secrecy. We brought the cost down enough to hopefully make them worth playing (at least situationally) outside of secrecy. The real question is if the effects are worth it even for free. But I think they are.

Finally, we have Heavy Stroke. It's...not a good card. You have to do 4 damage through an enemy's defense to make it better than Khazad Khazad, and there are very few enemies with more than 7 hit points. And really, to be more cost-effective than Khazad Khazad, you need to be doing much more than that. But it only works on a single Dwarf character, and since the nerf of the Erebor Battle Master there aren't any Dwarfs that can even get up to enough attack to make it even close to worth it, and even fewer enemies where it makes sense to use the event anyways. So we moved a different direction, more like Firefoot instead. Dealing damage to another enemy engaged with you is a much better use of the resource, and fills a niche that currently is only filled by Firefoot. It's probably a more powerful effect than Firefoot, but it's not repeatable, so I'm ok with that.

So - what do y'all think?

There are 3 cards from the cycle that we didn't touch but that might be worth touching. Path of Need is really expensive, but really powerful. Longbeard Elder is a fine 3 cost for 2 willpower and 2 hit points, with an interesting ability (that gets really good with scrying). And the Erebor Battle Master is still good value at 3 cost (for 5 attack - 6 when boosted by Dain!), but might be overshadowed in a Dain deck just by swarming cheaper allies (like Veteran Axehand). Like I said - what do y'all think? Do any of these 3 need extra help, or do they all have enough of a place in decks on their own?
