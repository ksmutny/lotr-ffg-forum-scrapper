# [How is Loragorn and Desperate Alliance valid?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103825-how-is-loragorn-and-desperate-alliance-valid/)

I was playing yesterday and someone did this 'trick' to lower both our threats to the starting level. I immediately took issue with him until he pointed out how the devs have ruled that this is valid.

 

What the hell is wrong with them? This is beyond stupid and ruins quests like Conflict at Carrock etc. How can you let them use Loargon to reset everyones threat like that. It should be once per game! Now you just pass him around and ignore threat for everyone.

 

I hope this is like the whole fiasco about attaching cards like Ancient Mathom to locations that are immune to card effects. One email from Caleb says its kosher (with a laughable explanation) that was then appropriately overturned in a FAQ. 

 

Once again please overturn this stupidity.

I fully expect this to get overruled in a future FAQ once it's proven how broken this can be. And it'll only get worse as more cards enter the game to allow these kind of shenanigans. A single card should not allow a fundamental pillar of the game (threat) to be a non-issue. I have to hope that the designers just didn't realize how the card would be exploited (like Beravor and Zigil Miner) and revise the rules.

 

How does everyone else feel about this combo? Have you played in really close game only to have threat become a non-issue using these tricks. I've seen this a few times now and I didn't find it very fun. It really felt like we were gaming the system and totally ruined my sense of immersion and narrative. In fact, I think it felt like cheating. Yuck.

 

I'm also hoping they bring in a hand limit. I've played a few multiplayer games lately where the other player drew their entire deck. It totally ruined the game for me. I know that the new AP cycle has hand size hate, but that's just a Dunland gimmick and they can't do that every cycle going forward. With so much card draw and so many ways to recycle events, a hand limit is necessary to create tension. Having your entire deck in your hand is fun at first until you realize just how trivial (and uninteresting) the game becomes at that point.

 

I really respect Caleb and Matthew and think they are doing wonderful things for this game, but there are some serious problems that need to be fixed properly (via errata and a new FAQ) and not through compensation using the encounter deck.

> I feel pretty ok about the Aragorn combo and the drawing your whole deck combos mostly because I haven't actually tried them and don't intend to, just doesn't seem fun so I don't see the point in bothering. It's a co-op game, if drawing your whole hand ruins the experience for you or resetting everyone's threat, simply don't do it. Although I know people still take issue with it but that's how I personally feel when playing

This comment only applies to if you play solo. I wasn't asking about that.

You can't stop others from making legal plays, no matter how broken they are. Since this is a co-op game most people are going to pay with others. Right now, Caleb's assinine ruling has pretty much forced me to avoid playing group games.

If it didn't bug me so much, there's some rulings I'd love to ignore. I can't remember if it was Caleb or someone else, but the explanation on how surge still takes effect if you cancel the card drove me nuts.

thank you everyone - Caleb please listen - change this ruling!

I've always wondered about how you define "starting threat" in the situation where you have an extra hero.  Seems like Caleb and co. could say that Aragorn's 12 threat is included when you reset to your starting threat.  So a 30 threat deck would only be able to reset to 42 if you use this combo.  It twists the definition of "starting" a little bit, but at least you don't have to flip-flop or make exceptions to the per player, per game ruling.

Your starting threat is your starting threat, not the starting threat you would have if you had loragorn...

Well, maybe Caleb though it was working that way so he though it was not over broken...

 

Interisting question when you control mirlonde, if someone make an official question, please include this in your question.

Alright. I'm sorry. It's just the constant comments about don't do it if you don't want to don't apply to those of us who play the game it was meant to be played.

The game is a co-op game - it isn't a two handed solo game. That's something people made up. It actually violates the table talk rule so is technical illegal. But to each his own.

I can't control in a 4 player game is the other guys do this. It totally ruined a game we played as no one included threat reduction and basically used this to murder the board to death.

The ruling as it stands just seems stupid. Aragorn has an ability that should be once per game. And we know caleb has gone back on his work more times then Gollum. Do you remember the whole locations immune to player card effects fiasco?or in blood of gondor where it seems that you should have a choice as to what to do with turning over hidden cards or taking a new one, but he says you do?

I just don't see how this makes any sense and others seem to agree. It should be changed to once per game. Just waiting for them to smarten up again and do it.

The ruling comes from Landraval which was FAQ'd to be once per game per player. As a result once per game now means (once per game per player) as this is an FAQ on what the wording means (and not an Errata on Landraval).

To get the solution you want (if you feel this is a broken combo) You should suggest to Caleb or another developer that once per game should be once per game (irrespective of players) and ask for Landraval to be errated to once per game per player.

This 'would' be valuable to clear up as it would enable them to make cards in future which are either once per game (truly amazing effects) and once per game per player (effects that are amazing but need to scale with players to effect the game equally viably in bigger and smaller games).

On the other hand practically every effect they would want to make would be once per game per player really - since most cards need to scale with more players. So it may be better to just Errata Lore Aragorn perhaps too: One use per game, once this effect is used treat this text as blank. Or something like that.

 

Edit: For the record I completely see the importance of having it addressed in an FAQ or rules and understand why you don't want to accept "just don't use it if you don't like it". However It has in fact been addressed in the FAQ (under Landraval and by Caleb directly) - it's just you don't like the decision.
