If active location has the search trait and you explore it in quest phase by resolving quest step and you reveal Mugash, what happens?

If you read the Response, what do you think? You must pass to stage 3 after? Questing successfully was past? Do you need to wait for next round to return to win the quest and trigger this response? Or it is immediate and you can pass 3b directly?

Here's the official ruling from Caleb: 

 

The Forced effect on stage 2b triggers after “questing successfully” which actually occurs before any progress is placed. Placing progress is only done after determining whether or not the players have quested successfully. That’s why it goes on to say “cancel all progress that would be placed on this stage…” (emphasis added). Since the Searches X keyword only triggers when a location is explored (and that only happens after placing progress on it), it is not possible to bring Mugash into play and advance to stage 3a in the same quest phase (unless you use a player card effect to explore a location before resolving the quest).
