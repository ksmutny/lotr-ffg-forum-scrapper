So how is this game going?

 

I have basically been out for a while. I have felt that there is so much content now, I couldn't ever play them all. So I sorta stopped.

 

Still I keep an eye on it and was just wondering what you guys think of the game at the moment. I am only uptodate until the Shadow Cycle.

Long story short, Caleb Grace and Matt Newman (Feonix) took over the design after the Against the Shadow cycle, and they seem to focus quest design on innovation and decision making rather than raw difficulty (although many of the new quests are the hardest the game has ever had). Player card wise, cards are a lot more balanced and they are more focused on expanding the synergies "horizontally", which means traits and abilities rely more on creative mechanics that encourage decision making and thought, each trait having distinct strengths and weaknesses rather than mindless global buffs like early Dwarves and Outlands. My personal opinion is that the game is better than ever.
