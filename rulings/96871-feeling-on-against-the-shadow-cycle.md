I suck at this game...I suck REAL bad, like can barely beat Passage Through Mirkwood bad and end up killed by Spiders and Locations. I have given this game up THREE TIMES!!! Sold and Traded away because I don't have time to "deck-build". I'm here for the story and narrative. Core Set through Dwerrowdelf didn't do enough for me to keep playing, so I gave up.

 

then...came easy mode. Awesome! Finally! I just want to form thematic teams of heroes, not justify in my game brain why Denethor and Eowyn and Aragorn would be traveling together. Well...I still suck at this game even on easy mode. But, I can see myself winning soon with a couple of adjustments.

 

That all being said, the other thing that brought me back was the potential of the cycle in reference! When I saw a whole page of Story/flavor Text, I thought, YES! This is what I'm talking about! Then, I picked up an opened a AP for this cycle and boom! More story on the back for after you win the AP!!! I felt this kicked ass and am now still ready to keep going.

 

Was the narrative and story entries appreciated by LotR players??

 

Do you think Voice if Isengard will continue this trend or do you think it will revert back to Shadows of Mirkwood Style?? If so, I may be moving toward the door again.

 

Thanks!

Caleb (the current lead designer for the game) has explicitly said that they want to really push the narrative aspect of the game for future cycles, so I think it's pretty safe to say that the ATS trend will continue with VOI and the Ring-maker.
