Hello all,

I have recently bought the Hobbit UHaOH saga expansion. With that comes Dori which reads: "After a hero is assigned any amount of damage, exhaust Dori to place that damage on Dori instead".

Question is simple: can I still trigger Gloins (the hero Core Set version) response when I use Dori? I think yes, because it says 'when a hero IS assigned' so it is already 'suffers'.

Thanks for answers in advance!
