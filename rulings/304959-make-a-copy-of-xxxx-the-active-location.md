The stage one setup instructions on the new Wrath and Ruin quest include the text: mak a copy of Makeshift Fortification the active location.

Sounds really simple, but as we all know simple instructions can be misunderstood and that can throw a game. 

So does this mean

A) If a player picked it to put in the staging area:

1. You make that copy the active location

2. You leave that copy and take one from the encounter deck

3  either option as the players choice. 

B) the players didn't put a copy in the staging area

1 . You search the encounter deck and put one in play

2. Nothing happens as one wasnt put into play
