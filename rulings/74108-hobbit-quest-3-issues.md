Apologies if there is already a thread for this, if there is then someone just link me to it. I'm also posting this without the cards or rules handy, so sorry for any mistakes…

 

We are having great difficulty with the third Quest from the OHaUH Hobbit box, so much so that we're not sure we're interpretting the rules properly.  Let me see if we have this right…
You cannot move on to the third part of the Quest until you correctly answer 9 Riddles, all of which involve randomly discarding cards from the top of your deck.  If you incorrectly guess at what card will be discarded, Gollum does 1 damage to Bilbo, who cannot be healed.  So we have to correctly guess 9 times before we make 3 wrong guesses or else Bilbo dies…
How are we supposed to beat this, short of rebuilding our decks to increase our chances of guessing what will be discarded?  We have a 4-player party using mostly mixed-sphere decks; it would be bad enough if the Riddles only required us to guess 1 thing about the card (sphere, type, etc) but some of them require you to guess multiple attributes correctly, like both the cost and sphere.  wtf!

How is anyone beating this other than dumb luck and playing it over and over?  I really hope somone just tells me we are doing it completely wrong; its the most frustrating experience I've had with this game since the "escape test" Quest when Gollum got shuffled back into the encounter deck.

About the Treasure quest, aren't you annoyed by the way the Purse and the Key work? Basically, if you see them before the Trolls arrive, there's no way you can loot them. How frustrating is that? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] My friends and I homeruled that those objectives are attached to the Trolls when they appear.



This situation has been clarified by Caleb Grace of FFG. If the objectives are revealed before the trolls are in play, the Key/Purse are discarded. This gives you a chance to acquire them when the encounter deck is reshuffled.
