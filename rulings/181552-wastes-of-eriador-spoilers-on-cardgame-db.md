Was doing some deckbuilding and found all the cards in the deck builder over there. Enjoy

You know, in all of those threads I haven't seen an official response that really addresses the issue.  I'll send a question to Caleb to put this thing to rest.

That is not how costs work in this game. Dealing the damage is a cost, if you paid the cost then you can cancel the shadow. The fact that a response is then triggered to cancel the damage does not mean that you did not pay the cost. We should wait for a response for Caleb, but I am positive that the Helm works with Erkenbrand.

You guys may well be right - I forgot that the discussion re: Treebeard/Erkenbrand was to do with transferring the damage via Song of Mocking rather than cancelling it outright. That clearly doesn't work as the damage is never dealt, but it may well be that cancelling the damage does. I'd want to hear it from Caleb before declaring myself certain on this point though.

Wow. I am excited for these cards. This looks to be a great AP. They don't seem overpowered, just mechanically interesting. Caleb and Matt are once again on point!    :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The official answer is in.  You CANNOT use damage cancellation with Erkenbrand.

 

> Hi Jim,
> When a player uses a Response to cancel an effect, the result is that the canceled effect never resolves. For example, when a player uses A Test of Will to cancel the ‘when revealed’ effects of The Necromancer’s Reach, the players do not deal 1 damage to each character in play and then remove 1 damage from each character in play. Instead, no damage is dealt.
> Similarly, if you use the Response effect on Raven-winged Helm to cancel the damage just dealt to Erkenbrand after triggering his Response effect, you do not place 1 damage on Erkenbrand and then remove it. Instead, the damage is not dealt at all. In which case, his cost has not been paid and you cannot resolve his effect.
> Visually, it looks like this:
> Damage is dealt by effect ——> Response effect cancels damage dealt ——> No damage is actually dealt

Eh, whatever, I will not follow this ridiculous ruling anyway. And I will not be surprised if it gets changed in the future, like that stuff with Forest Snare being attached to Nameless Thing as a part of it's effect and and actuallty taking effect (i.e. preventing it from attacking).

hmm... I guess that ruling makes sense. You cancel an effect, it will never apply (maybe we need a "Stack" like Magic has to avoid timing confusion?)

 

It's just the words "damage just dealt" that I have a problem with. The Test of Will/Necromancer's Reach example makes sense, no damage will be applied in this case. But damage cancellation cards all say "cancel x damage just dealt". You have to deal the damage first, which kind of contradicts the "cancel" effect. Almost seems like a funky, restrictive "healing" than actual damage prevention. Or does "damage just dealt" means it's damage assigned, but not officially applied just yet? Either way, it's convoluted... >_>

 

Maybe they should errata these few cards to say "Cancel x damage". That's it.

We can add "annoyance" to my reactions.  No where in the massive packaging does it give the conditions required to meet Valour.  The pack does say that the Core Set and The Lost Realm are required, but it doesn't say you need an internet connection.

 

I'm sure the adventure and cards inside are good to great from what I've seen so far.  It's a shame that Caleb and Matt's hard work are ruined this way.

I knew what the rule is, but since I hadn't found the rules sheet it annoyed me that it wasn't in the package.

I think it's great encounter cards can benefit you. It opens up so many deck design strategies. Essentially every deck or set of decks of 50 you build are to tackle one puzzle. Each piece you include is in some way a counter to get an edge on the puzzle. Using Thalin in a quest with 1 HP enemies is no different than designing a strategy to control the encounter deck or making the encounter cards work for you. It's another way of negating or limiting the opposing puzzle as much as possible. Caleb and Matt talked at gen con how they want to game to keep expanding horizontally without too much vertical power creep. Mission accomplished. I think the most recent quests in this last cycle are some the best quests by far. They are challenging in the right way. Like a "play true to you strategy and hope for the best with some bad luck possible" instead of massive bombs of "game over" cards. This last Ettenmoors quest is one of my favorites ever. When I lose on that or the Eriador Wargs it's still fun. When I lost on Hobbit boxes, or to some extent Andros I just didn't want to play anymore.

 

Yet even if you don't want to tailor the deck build, every quest so far in the 5th cycle has been totally approachable with a classic power card deck. You can throw together 2 typical spirit questing and tactics locking decks that folks have been using since the first two cycles and approach all these new quests with hope of victory.
