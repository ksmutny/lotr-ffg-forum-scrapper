# [Lonely Mountain 2B and Smaug the Golden Question (Forced Effect timing)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83067-lonely-mountain-2b-and-smaug-the-golden-question-forced-effect-timing/)

## 1 [arandhawa on April 28, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83067-lonely-mountain-2b-and-smaug-the-golden-question-forced-effect-timing/?do=findComment&comment=789841)

I'm currently on quest 2B of the Lonely Mountain quest on the Hobbit: On the Doorstep and I have 5 progress tokens on Smaug the Golden. I then quest successfully and trigger the first Forced effect on quest 2B. This requires me to place a 6th progress token on Smaug the Golden, make a burgle attempt and if successful take a treasure under the Lonely Mountain and then move to Stage 3 if I want.

My question is.. After immediately placing the 6th token on Smaug the Golden do I

1)  immediately resolve his Forced effect (where after putting the 6th progress token on him I advance to stage 4A) and THEN finish up the rest of the first forced effect on 2B(make a burgle attempt,etc.)? If I do this and move to Stage 4A does that invalidate stage 2B's remaining effect since it's out of play?

or

2)do I finish the forced effect on Quest 2B (which after placing the 6th token on Smaug the Golden I would make a Burgle attempt and if successful take a treasure card under Lonely mountain and advance to stage 3) and then deal with Smaug the Golden's Forced effect of having placed the 6th progress token? If I do this second option wouldn't that invalidate Smaug the Golden's Forced Effect since by moving to Stage 3 I put him out of play and bring in Smaug the Magnificent?

 

Any help would be appreciated.

 

Thanks!

I have asked to Caleb for this question that we faced last night:

The answer is:

"Hi,

When you resolve the Forced effect on stage 2B, you resolve it sentence by sentence. The first sentence instructs you to place 1 progress on Smaug. If that is the 6th progress on Smaug, then Smaug’s Forced effect kicks in and redirects you to stage 4A, removing stage 2B from play. Since stage 2B’s text is no longer active, you do not resolve the next sentence on it. Instead, you must resolve the ‘when revealed’ effects on stage 4A.

Therefore, when you place the 6th progress on Smaug at stage 2B, you do not make a burgle attempt, instead you advance to stage 4A. You must defeat stage 4B in order to return to stage 2B.

I hope you’re enjoying The Lonely Mountain!

Cheers,

Caleb"

Hope this helps

Thanks for that, Emilius... even though I find that ruling extremely frustrating, and I now wish that I had remained blissfully ignorant of it.

 

I have great respect for Caleb (as a designer, and also due to his accessibility to the community), but it REALLY annoys me when developers provide responses that are inconsistent with the official FAQs, doubly so when an expansion's rules insert could/should have addressed ambiguous situations (and if I recall correctly, there are several significant ones in the Hobbit sets).

 

According to the FAQ:

 

(1.24) Questing Successfully 

Questing successfully and the physical placement of progress tokens are two separate game occurrences that happen in sequence during the Quest Resolution step. As soon as the players determine that the total committed Willpower is greater than the total Threat in the staging area, they are considered to have quested successfully. Any Forced or passive effects initiated by questing successfully resolve before physically placing progress tokens. 

Example: Tom has just successfully quested during stage 1B of The Hunt Begins (SoM 11), and he will be placing enough progress to advance to the next stage. However, he must first resolve the Forced effect (which resolves immediately upon the occurence of “questing succesfully”) before placing progress tokens on the quest.

 

Also:

 

(1.02) Simultaneous Effect Timing If two or more conflicting effects would occur simultaneously, the first player decides the order in which the effects resolve.

 

It seems pretty clear to me that the wording of FAQ 1.24 indicates that a Forced effect must be resolved fully before any tokens are placed on a quest card (and/or, in this case, on Smaug the Golden)... it says nothing of resolving Forced effects "sentence by sentence" (across Forced effects that span two different cards), which just feels like a ruling issued on the fly nearly 3 years after the Hobbit saga expansions were released. And, if one accepts that both my interpretation and that of Caleb are valid/consistent with the rules and FAQ (and that the differing interpretations effectively create conflicting effects that would occur simultaneously), then FAQ 1.02 ultimately should prevail and allow the first player to decide in what order to resolve the Forced effects on stage 2B and Smaug the Golden. If the developers had intended otherwise, then IMO, they should have made that explicit in the scenario rules insert.

 

I think I'm especially bitter because of how hard I fought to burgle all the treasures and escape successfully against all odds, in a manner that I (and other players on these boards) agreed was legitimate... only to have that win invalidated by what feels to me like an ad hoc ruling. Yes, it's only a game and I shouldn't take it seriously, and yes, I can ignore the answer from the devs... but these kinds of inconsistencies and shifting rules just drive me nuts, and deflate one's sense of accomplishment after the fact...

 

How many times do we have to win in this game only to find out later that we really did not win due to ambiguous rules wording/situations and debatable developer rulings?

 

[End of rant]...
