> I'm happy that they're tying some of the POD stuff into the campaigns. I'll have to look into getting these when they come out, should be fun! Plus, anything that links the scenarios and gives some continuity to different quests (more narrative FTW) is good in my book.

 

In theory I love that they are making all these quests linked and expanding on one campaign, but I never have the time to play more than 2 games at once, so this has no real effect on me. If I played the game a lot more, then I'd have more chance to try all the quests, so I think I'd be more excited for new quests, but I have yet to play more than 2/3 of the quests so far.

 

In all honesty, I'd be ok with not getting ANY more cards for a while because there are still so many decks and quests I want to try but will never get around to. The biggest reason I get excited about new cards is simply because they spoil them.

 

I understand that comparitively I'm a casual gamer and FFG can't cater to people like me if they want to stay in business, and Caleb and co. would be sitting around doing nothing if they didn't keep releasing new content.

 

Anyway, I guess I don't have a real good point to this post... just throwing out my thoughts. Continue with your discussions. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
