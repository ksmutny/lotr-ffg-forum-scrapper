Hello all,

I had some questions about my new FoS AP.

Mostly about separate staging areas:

If player A has Dain and the players are separated, player B doesn't get the bonus right?

The rulesheet says somewhere: During the encounter phase players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area.

Should it read: Duribg the quest phase/During the staging step of the quest phase or am I supposed to reveal cards twice per round?

If Watchful Eyes is attached to a hero of Player A and the new encounter deck gets shuffled in the rulesheet reads: remove all other encounter cards from the game. So that does include these sorts of cards?

Thanks in advance!

Thanks GrandSpleen!

It says encounter phase, so maybe I should sent Caleb an email..

I will have my go at it this evening! Happy Holidays!
