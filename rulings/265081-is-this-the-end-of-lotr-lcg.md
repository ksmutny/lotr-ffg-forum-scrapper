With the new game announced, we now know that Caleb is going to be the designer. What will happen to LotR lcg? Is it going to be handled to another team? abandoned?

What do you think?

A ‘is the game dying?’ post. That didn’t take long.

in the announcement it said Caleb’s role in the digital game will become reduced as time goes on. And it said the tabletop game will continue alongside this. 

No, the game is not dying.  Go back to the shadow!
