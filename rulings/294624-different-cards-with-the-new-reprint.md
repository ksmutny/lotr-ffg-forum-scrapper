It seems that with the new reprint, some cards have been modified.

See below  the example for  LEGACY OF DURIN”.

It also seems that the modified cards will be inserted in the next faqs.

Do you have any news regarding this changed cards?  Do you know if there are other cards that have been modified during reprinting?

Conversely, this is actually what I like most about this erratum: it protects the encounter deck from what is (was) to my taste the most boring card in the pool. Now it is a bit more interesting to deckbuild with, for many of the reasons your earlier post detailed re: difficulties with some of your extant fellowships.

I think a lot of criticism along the lines of "well, how do I win this quest(s) now!?" here is really more about those quest(s) than BB. Heirs/Against the Shadow has too much shadow-chaining; Carn Dum is essentially a NM quest in normal sheep's clothing.

I firmly believe that if BB had never existed in its original form, and we got this new version released in the latest pack, the general reaction would be that it's a solid card. There would be comparisons to Armored Destrier—pluses and minuses, people would say it's weaker, others would counter that it was a good option for Lore, etc.—but overall no one would call it a coaster.

This hits the progression and limited-pool players harder, I grant. But I do not fault Caleb for choosing to mitigate what feels like the biggest design mistake in the pool from the standpoint of repeatedly eliminating drama that is supposed to be intrinsic to the framework.

While I agree whole heartedly with your overall point, I would argue that Blood/Fire represent the biggest design mistake in the current pool. Burning brand is a clear second, though. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Actually, I now remember the interview to Caleb done during the Lure of Middle Earth this year.

 

Interestingly enough, he said his biggest disappointment was the Dunedain trait, in particular the Warden of Annúminas. If I remember correctly, he commented that upon conceiving the Dunedain trait, he thought that the mechanics of keeping enemies engaged with you would be very cool. To this, a friend of him told him "but who would want to keep enemies engaged with him?"

Well Caleb, you just shot yourself in the foot...

This is not even close to true. I can no longer find a PDF of the original rulebook, but the Learn to Play is 32 pages and the Rules Reference is 29. The FAQ is 19, and of that, only two and a half pages are actually taken up by errata.

1. Um, what? Staff of Lebethron was never a better choice than Burning Brand assuming either could be attached. With the errata it's a bit closer, but Burning Brand is still better (which is fair, it costs more).

2. The fact the essential function and common case haven't changed directly contradict your claim that 'all of that is now obsolete'. Some of it may be obsolete, the decks that stacked a Burning Brand hero with readying effects to ignore all shadows forever are obsolete (but that was a broken case which needed to be fixed), and some decks now have one Restricted attachment too many (but many of those can be reasonably tweaked to manage without one of those attachments). Very little has actually been made obsolete.

3. You say there was no broken combo which required errata, and then later go on to describe the case of stacking Burning Brand with readying effects and other defensive attachments - which is a broken combo that (imo) required errata.

4. From my own perspective, I don't think nerfing Burning Brand makes the game meaningfully harder, because any quest in the game could be beaten pretty reliably without using it. It *was* (part of) one method of making the game a lot easier and, notably, less interesting by removing the aforementioned drama - the game is designed on the assumption that shadow effects are something the players will have to deal with to some extent, and Burning Brand on the right target made it too easy to just excise that entire aspect of the game.

To my mind, this Burning Brand errata is actually the perfect kind of errata, in that it blocks the broken case while leaving the common case untouched, as you yourself noted. From my own personal perspective it also rehabilitates the card to the point where as mentioned, I'm now much more likely to play it myself.

I mean, he was absolutely right, the Dunedain mechanics are very cool. His friend was clearly wrong.

And if your implication here is that you can't play Dunedain and keep a bunch of enemies engaged without pre-errata Burning Brand, I can tell you from substantial experience that you are also clearly wrong.

I just listened to that interview (Nerd Meets You podcast)—it's really excellent.

Caleb was not denigrating the entire Dúnedain archetype at all; he even says he's "happy with all of them"… Except the Warden, who Matt Newman told him was overcosted for the ability. Caleb was afraid of it being OP due to absence of a limit on the willpower bonus, but he admitted that subsequent experience has shown him to be wrong.

Anyway, just wanted to be sure that no one thought Caleb regretted the whole Dúnedain mechanic, heh. Listen for yourself (at the 11 min mark):

Even as a pro-errata guy, I sympathize with many of the points in your latest post. Errata do have a kind of psychic cost to them. (But I'd say that the contribution of errata to misbegotten wins is pretty minimal, compared to the hairball of rules that make up this game at this point, heh)

I guess I subscribe to an auteur perspective on this game: I want to play the game that the designer intends, since Caleb, though imperfect like all of us humans, has almost always earned my trust in him. He shapes the game with every new release—essentially all of us (who are not playtesters) have no idea what ends up on the cutting room floor, after all. To me, errata are just another way in which he shapes it, albeit one that he prudently does not use often.

Contrary to @sappidus, I am obviously not a pro-errata guy, but the same as him, Caleb has all my trust in terms of game design, or at least, in terms of scenario design 😛. For me, the last cycles (Dream Chaser, Harad and Rhovanion) are among the very best of this game, with a special mention to Mountain of Fire. Although it is a very tough end for the campaign, I have to admit the mechanics evoke perfectly the theme and tone of the books.

I'm pleased with the game design in general, and I'm especially pleased with how the latest cycle has synergized with lesser cards from past cycles.  If you squint hard, you can even now justify playing Power in the Earth and Beorning Beekeeper!

I will answer your question marks as well as voice my opinion about some errata.

Thicket of Spears and Out of Sight used to be a multi-target Feint, they used to prevent all attacks from engaged enemies against any player. I wonder why Hobbit-sense has not gotten an errata yet as it also prevent enemies from attacking. Narvi's Belt could be used to generate Baggins ressources as rees263 already pointed out. Nori reduced your threat after a dwarf character entered play under your control. Combine this with Sneak Attack or A very good Tale und you got some crazy threat reduction. I am not familiar with the old combo of Master of Lore, so I cannot comment this card. Maybe you can explain it to me.

A Watchful peace allowed to bring a location back to the encounter deck that had victory points, potentially abusing some cards. Trained for War was changed so it could be used on quests that had key-words other than Siege like Dire or Defense. Blue Mountain Trader allowed free ressource trading between players (and heroes of different spheres) thus trivializing the planning phase. Imagine like A Good Harvest in ally form for all players.

Love of Tales is limited once per hero instead of restricted, but you surely meant that. Sure, you can no longer generate three ressourcs on a single hero when playing a song, most of which can be paid by any hero. I never tried this combo, so I cannot say, whether it was extreme or not.

I never had a problem with the Errata for Horn of Gondor, seeing as it was intended to fascilitate chump blocking. This way it would no longer combo with the silvan events, which it was not designed for as this was too powerful. Normally by chumping you sacrifice an ally to save a hero, silvan events only give you benefits from the event itself and replaying the returned ally. Seeing that most silvans only cost 2 ressources, HoG paid for half your cards already.
It also no longer synergizes with Sneak Attack, which used to be clearly intented by the developers (look at some older news, back when they still wrote other articles that just announcements), but in my opinion this is not bad. After all Boromir used his horn when he was in dire need and not because Legolas went scouting into the woods.

WANI was a power nerf, but a needed one, as generating a dozen ressources with a single card (and potential readying with Lure of Moria) is just plain overpowered. Traffic from Dale is a similar card, but at least it is limited to once per round and having allies with attachments is more difficult to achieve than spamming dwarves.

Háma and Thicket of Spears just trivialized combat for a single player, as you no longer needed to defend non-immune enemies. You just engaged everything and let them rot. I cannot say whether this was the best way to nerf the situation but at least it no longer restricted Caleb in the invention of new tactics events. Not even spirit can play a single event for the rest of the game.

I am fine with errata to Legacy of Durin and Erebor Battle Master. Five attack for a single ally (with Dáin) is enough, I see no justification why a dwarf should be able to one-hit everything in the game. Granted you need some work to achieve such a power level, but it is not as if you had to exhaust all other dwarves to use his ability or something. The nerf to Legacy is similar to the one of Nori.

Burning Brand again is one of those cards trivializing the game, which I should be fine with nerfing, though I will have to adjust my deck-building and approach on shadow effects. I wonder why Elrond or Warden of Healing have not received an errata.

This reminds me of something I've been wondering: I did progression play myself when getting into the game, and loved it. And it still gets discussed quite a bit.

But how many people these days actually do it? Anecdotally in my area, at least, literally all the players who have an interest in the game (who do not have the entire pool) have a smattering of products spread out quite a bit in time, usually including the latest cycle, or sometimes a cycle like Dream-chaser that is slightly less recent but still relatively "modern".

Caleb has remarked several times about designing the player cards of Wilds and the Ered Mithrin cycle to be a good addition to the Core right away for new players. I wonder if he really thinks much about progression play at all; or whether he perceives that the state of reprints, the overwhelming size of the pool, etc. means that progression play is pretty unrealistic for the vast majority of players. His mental mode may be that people tend to buy more recent stuff, then backfill when they have the opportunity.

Or maybe I'm off base here. What do people think?

I think you're probably right, although I'm speaking from assumptions rather than data. It's 3 or 4 years since I obtained the whole card pool and started buying expansions as they were released, but before that I would pick up packs almost completely based off of what could be got for a good bargain at the moment. I never had any interest in progression style, but even if I had I think that combination of availability + economics would have won out. And that was during a time of relative plenty in terms of reprints.

I was pleased on behalf of new players that the Wilds of Rhovanian had a thematic, formidable archetype right out of the box. I suspect Caleb is very sensitive to the fact that (from what I've seen) most stores, if they keep physical stock of the game at all, typically have the Core Set and at most one or two of the most recent releases. I doubt many newer players have progression play on their minds.

There must be some scenario-specific reason why Watchful Peace bringing back VP locations is problematic, because for the most part VP locations are obnoxious beasties you don't want to see again.  I took a brief look at VP locations and nothing jumped out of me.  Overall the errata preserves the common case, and it's a rarely used sideboard card in any case.

Did the original wording of Trained for War exclude keywords, making it a rare positive errata?

Blue Mountain Trader's errata was expected as soon as the card came out, and came in the form people expected, preserving a common case.  BMT didn't allow free redistribution between players (a maximum net transfer of one no matter how many exchanges were made), but within each player was equivalent of a solo Errand Rider that didn't exhaust.  I don't the effect was game-breaking (unlike Good Harvest, it couldn't be used to play a sphere you didn't have), and more importantly it required *cooperation* to work, so it could not affect anyone who didn't wish to be affected.  But all the same, the form of the errata was well done.  This was also a card that was errata-ed at the first opportunity after printing, I'm much more sympathetic to those ("Whoops, we didn't mean to do that") than to errata of long-standing cards--I think it's quite possible that the designers didn't realize its potential int he first place.

The key change for Love of Tales wasn't the 1 per hero (that's limiting, but since it's not unique you can still have multiple copies in play), but the exhaustion -- that nerfed the card/resource loop by restricting the resources.  Really, *any* attachment that generates resources and doesn't exhaust (or have a hard per round limit) is just waiting for the right combination to break the game.  This was not a surprise nerf, but the limit 1 per hero was not necessary after exhaustion was added.  Post-nerf it's returned to obscurity, though it at least is a reliable (and free) generator in a song-heavy deck.  It's a shame that the lesson about exhaustion wasn't followed for Horn of Gondor.

Original WANI in conjunction with Lure of Moria works out to a net resource gain if you have more than 3 dwarves, and are willing to burn the powerful Lure of Moria event (or can easily recur it).  WANI/Lure of Moria/Legacy of Durin could be used for a draw-your-deck loop, so some limitation on WANI and/or Legacy of Durin makes sense -- but aside from the novelty value, if you can make a massive amount of money because you have a massive amount of dwarves on the table, you *already* are in a winning place and are just doing "win more".  My grief against the WANI errata isn't that it was limited, but that it was *changed* to be a much less useful card -- the common case was not preserved.  Put "limit 3" on it instead and it can still be used to help you get five dwarves out quickly.

The original errata to Thicket of Spears shows clearly that the designers had no problem with Hama "trivializing combat" for a single player.  The larger problem is that thanks to Mablung and TaAragorn, Hama-deck could steal other players' enemies as well and trivialize combat for *multiple* player.  The problem with the errata is that it doesn't preserve the common case -- rather than focusing on preventing the recursion of powerful cards, it incents Hama to *only* recur powerful cards by giving him a per-game limit.  Sending Thicket of Spears to the victory pile, or turning a Hama-recurred cards into an attachment which is removed or bottom-decked after play would've limited recursion of *specific* cards while still allowing Hama to do what he was designed to do.  As it is, the nerf pretends that while Hama playing Thicket of Spears every turn cannot be born, even at the cost of using the only card drawn and all of the resources generated, playing Thicket of Spears nine times is just fine (3x + 3 Hama + 3 tome).  I don't think the design space opened by allowing nine plays (or more in combination with other cards) but not every turn actually exists.  Honestly, if there's an event that's problematic in *any* sphere to recur repeatedly, it needs to go to the victory display after playing.

Tactics Gimli takes issue with your claim that one dwarf should not be able to one-shot everything.  The nerf to EBM capping at five preserves the common case, but strikes me as unnecessary -- if you have an obscene number of dwarves to generate obscene EBM attack values, you probably don't *need* EBM for obscene attack values.  It's preventing a win-more that was fun, but pointless.  At least EBM's cap doesn't leave him inferior to a same-cost card, like poor Leaflock.  More concerning to me is that with the change to EBM *and* Legacy of Durin on the heels of the WANI nerf, there's the appearance of a concerted effort to nerf dwarf decks in particular, as if there weren't other archtypes just as powerful or even more powerful.  Since dwarf deck is the first power deck progression-style, this hits new progression players hardest and I don't see that as a good thing.

The most powerful archtype is Vilya, but I don't see nerfing Vilya as either necessary or desirable.  A limit could be reasonably placed on the number of times Warden of Healing could be used per turn without impacting the common case, but I don't think the efficient healing provided by Elrond/Warden is a problem that needs fixed.

Black Rides has some friendly VP locations like Bag End, Woody End, Bamfurlong, Midgewater, The Troll's Camp etc. Returning those cards for the next staging step would make the game easier. And there is no thematic reason, Frodo should return to Bag End or any of the other locations several times in a row, when his goal is to reach Rivendell as soon as possible.

I might have worded my sentence ambiguosly, so I will try again: Blue Mountain Trader does not allow you to give your partner an arbitrary amount of ressources, you are right. But it allowed you to trade your tactics ressources into spirit ressources (when the trader returns back to you) and your partner could turn his leadership ressources into lore ones. This is the equivalent of having all songs of all spheres you control on all your heroes.

You are right, I remembered the errata wrong. Still, what would several copies of Love of Tales mean on a single hero? That he love songs even more than another hero? Thematicly I cannot see a justification. When you already use songs, most ressources can be spent as fit anyway, at least for playing cards, so you could just as well spread the Love for Tales over all your heroes (by making them lore beforehand).

I am not sure, I can follow you. If you want five dwarves, you already have at least Thorin and Ori in play, and probably also a third dwarven hero. With two dwarven allies, or one ally and Bombur hero, you have already reached the magical number of five dwarves. So this only leaves the case of a single dwarven ally, so you are missing out on a single ressource. Granted, this might make a difference, but not as severe as you made it sound.

Well, Gimli needs a lot of attachment to one-shot the Balrog or Smaug. Nevertheless, Gimli is a hero and thus unique, the Battle Master is not. You could nearly see it equivalent to a Battle Master giving +1 Attack to every dwarf ally you control, only concentrated on a single ally. Some say, Dáin is overpowered...

If you consider Leaflock in a poor shape, then what about Denethor? I am not concerned about nerfs to power decks. We still do not know, what Caleb is planning and what might be nerfed next time. He surely is not errataing cards out of boredom.

Tolkien describes Vilya as "the mightiest of the Three", thus second only to the One Ring. A powerful artifact justifies a powerful. But I was thinking of his unlimited healing bonus, which doubles the effect of the Warden of Healing. You say a limit is reasonable, but not needed. Sounds paradox to me.

Regardless, I will disagree on this point.

1) Yes, I can see where recycling Bag End would be very profitable, between zero threat, card draw, and stalling in stage one.  Of course, the designers could've made recycling Bag End less attractive for recycling by giving it high threat, since it starts as the active location.  It's not immune, so you can still swap it out and stall on stage one as long as you like.

Thematically, Frodo could return to Bag End for any reason he likes -- he is not, at this point, intent on reaching Rivendell ASAP and he is still hoping that Gandalf will show up before he leaves the shire.  He delayed leaving Bag End as long as possible and in fact left Bag End before returning for his final departure (that's when he overheard the Gaffer-half of the conversation with a Black Rider).  Stalling on stage one and putting off leaving Bag End as long as possible would be *highly thematic* -- but I'll grant that exploring Bag End a few times would make the scenario much easier.

2) I'm not sure why you're still trying to reword the effect of BMT.  It's unlimited resource redistribution within a player's heroes.  This is not the same as Good Harvest, and it's also not exactly the same as having Songs of each sphere you control on each hero.  For some cards/heroes, it matters *which* hero has the resources, and how many.  The equivalent would be an Errand-Rider in solo play who doesn't exhaust for his action.

3) If you must have a thematic justification for the existence of multiple non-tangible attachments on the same character, I don't see what's wrong with someone loving Tales twice as much as someone else who also loves Tales.  Sam probably fits that description well.  Similarly, I don't think there's anything wrong with one hero having more Unexpected Courage than another hero -- Sam also fits that description well.  I regretfully acknowledge that it's probably a good idea to break unlimited resource/card loops and that means resource-generating attachments *should* exhaust -- but I don't think there's any reason to go on to further nerf those cards based on arguable thematic arguments, especially when the card (like Love of Tales) isn't especially powerful in the common case anyway.

4) Five dwarves isn't useful just for Thorin, Ori, and to a lesser extent Oin, it's also useful for a number of allies.  But let's take a hypothetical case with both Thorin and Ori -- Thorin/Ori/Nori, tri-sphere deck, want to get to 5 ASAP.  There's two 1-cost allies (Sellsword and Record-Keeper), one of which will go away if you can't pay to keep them.  There's a lot of potential 2-cost dwarves.  In this case, the ability to use a 1-cost ally for WANI makes a huge difference on whether you can quest/fight and still have five dwarves at the beginning of the next round for Thorin and Ori.  I've used WANI to exhaust *only* a single Record-Keeper so I can get Zigil Miner out for my five, leaving all heroes ready.  That's not possible anymore, but it's worth burning WANI just to setup quickly on the most important turn -- the first.  Yes, when I get a huge swarm of dwarves out I can use WANI for huge piles of resources, but who cares?  If I've got a huge swarm of dwarves, I don't *need* lots of resources, I'm already in control.  WANI's top end is win-more.  It's using WANI for 1-2 allies at the beginning of the game that made the most difference, and that option is gone even though it wasn't overpowered.

5) Some do say that Dain is overpowered, though LeBoromir with Visionary Leadership does the same thing for Gondor.  So what?  If EBM is hitting for ten, you've still got ten dwarf allies and are very likely already in complete control.  EBM only gets ridiculous when the outcome isn't in doubt.  And when the outcome *isn't* in doubt, EBM isn't that powerful.  That's why I think the EBM errata isn't necessary, even though the errata also doesn't do much harm for the same reason.

6) Yes, Denethor (ally) is also a lame card.  Some people regret cards they consider overpowered -- I regret cards that are too weak.  I don't know what Caleb has in mind, but errata that purely affects power level can make a playable card unplayable if nerfed too hard, while errata enhancing weak cards impacts practically no one attached to the current version while actually expanding the effective card pool.  I think it's more elegant (and avoids the cost/annoyance of errata) to get new cards that synergize with old bad cards, but the few positive errata that have been made were uncontroversial and welcome.

7) *If* you were going to limit Warden of Healing, putting a limit on the readies would be the most reasonable errata -- it preserves the common case, while restricting a rare case (e.g. paying repeatedly for Gloin's healing so that he can take any number of undefended attacks -- with Elrond at the table and Song of Wisdom or Narvi's Belt on Gloin he can pay for his healing completely with Elrond + Warden of Healing, as long as he has sufficient hp).  Does that edge case justify errata to Warden of Healing?  It takes some setup, but can match Super Beregond *without* needing readies, and has the potential to monopolize defense in a pickup game.  If it were deemed obnoxious enough to errata, restricting the ready on the Warden would be the least obnoxious way to do it IMO.  But in no way do I consider the amazing efficiency of Elrond + Warden of Healing (the common case) to be a problem that requires fixing the *common* case.

True, it can. Fortunately no errata released for this game has done so, and I think we can be pretty confident Caleb does not intend for any future errata to do so.

Also, re: your WANI/Record-keeper example, if you exhaust Nori or Ori instead you only lose out on 1 willpower and still get your 5 Dwarves. I'd do it.

"Unplayable" is in the eye of the beholder, of course.  Master of Lore is an unpopular card, and in its original form would be a fairly popular card IMO.

You are correct that exhausting Nori in my specific example could help you get to five with little loss; Nori is almost certainly questing on turn 1, which is all Erebor Record Keeper can do if you're out of resources, and in that case it's just a loss of 1 willpower.  Thorin/Dain/X with two Dwarven Sellswords would be different, but rare.  My general point is that I've found WANI most impactful *early* when used for 1-2 resources, not late with a full-fledged swarm already on the table, and depending on which dwarf heroes you have in use that may be problematic.

My last deck using WANI built before errata was a Return to Mirkwood fellowship (using all the cards in that pack) with Theodred/Dain/Nori as the dwarf deck -- that can't get to 5 dwarves on turn one, but with 6 1-cost and 6 2-cost dwarves helped me get to five dwarves.  Using WANI in the planning phase in its current form isn't nearly as compelling, since Dain needs to be ready to buff dwarves, and Nori needs to quest if I want Theodred to give him a resource.  Had I built the same deck today, I don't think WANI makes the cut.

I would break player card errata into four categories:

1. Errata that are released at the earliest opportunity.  These are presumably errors that snuck through playtesting.

2. Errata that are released at the first opportunity after a quest or quests is released, because of a specific interaction seen with a player card and the mechanics/cards of that release.  Whether the interaction was forseen or not discovered until after release, it was deemed better to change the player card rather than call out the interaction in the quest-specific rules.

3. Errata that are released to break a specific player card combination, in the first FAQ after that combination is discovered/publicized.  These are presumably fixing something broken, but the newly discovered combo may or may not involve any newly released cards.

4. Errata that are released well after the original card without an obvious broken combination -- power nerfs presumably prompted either by increased strength in a larger pool or by a change in designer attitudes -- if memory serves, most of the errataed cards were not originally released by Caleb.

It's a bit of a judgement call where these lie -- was Beravor/Protector of Lorien nerfed in FAQ 1.3 because it was the first FAQ to actually use errata, because Beravor + 3x-per-player UC + Protector of Lorien generated massive willpower, or just as a power nerf?  I'll leave those two out of the list, and A Elbereth Gilthoniel because I'm not sure of the context, but here's where the others would fit IMO :

1: Zigil Miner, Nori, Thror's Map, Master of Lore [combo piece], Ravens of the Mountains,  Blue Mountain Trader

2: Feint, Thicket of Spears, Narvi's Belt , A Watchful Peace, Trained for War

3: Will of the West, Horn of Gondor, Love of Tales, Wandering Took, Out of the Wild, Wingfoot, We Are Not Idle

4: Erebor Battle Master, Expert Treasure Hunter, Boromir, Hama, Caldara, A Burning Brand, Legacy of Durin, Erebor Battle Master again.

The essence of the ABB superdefender is all present in the very first cycle -- Unexpected Courage, Song of Wisdom (if not Lore), A Burning Brand.  The premise that 4 safe defenses are fine (up to 13 if players cooperate) but more than that is abusive is hard for me to swallow.  Here's the repeatable readying attachments (that can ready after a defense) in release order:

Unexpected Courage (core)

Fast Hitch (Dead Marshes) [hobbit only]

Miruvor (Shadow and Flame) [requires putting back on deck and using your draw to repeat]

Spare Hood and Cloak (OHUH) [requires somebody else having and exhausting]

Heir of Mardil (Celebrimbor's Secret) [requires Noble and getting a resource, unique]

Shadowfax (Treason of Saruman) [requires Gandalf, unique]

Armored Destrier (Temple of the Deceived) [requires Sentinel or Leadership, takes a restricted slot]

Magic Ring (Crossings of Poros) [limit 1 per hero and 1 per deck, raises threat]

Elvenking (Fire in the Night) [requires Silvan and return to hand of Silvan ally, unique]

Ring of Thror (Ghost of Framsburg) [requires Dwarf, unique, guarded]

In the case of Mighty Beregond, the easy readies are UC, Armored Destrier (wastes a restricted slot), and Magic Ring (1 per deck, 1 per hero).  There's a host of events or temporary attachments that ready, but there were plenty of those when Tactics Beregond came out.  In the common case, the super defender is where he's always been.  There's two exceptions that can dramatically increase the number of readies:

1) Erestor + Miruvor.  Miruvor as repeatable ready has the unattractive feature of costing you your only draw for a single ready, and only Bilbo and Gleowine got you past that.  But Erestor/Arwen/Defender guarantees you can draw all three Miruvor and pay for at least two -- guarantees all three if the defender has spirit.  Looking at the decks using Beregond/ABB/UC (not that many), this is a reasonably popular combination.  However, at this point it's not exactly a new combination, we're on the third cycle since Angmar and there's been two FAQs since this popped up.

2) Spare Hood and Cloak + Long Lake Trader.  This isn't nearly as efficient as Erestor/Miruvor, since it requires a LLT for every cloak and also a suitable target to use it (likely the North Realm Lookout).  Outside a Dale deck it's a three card combo to provide a single repeatable ready -- inside a Dale Deck the excellent Redwater Sentry really reduces the value of having a hero defender in the first place.  I only saw one deck that bothered with this combo.

Indeed, looking at the ABB/Beregond/UC decks, except for the Erestor decks the norm for readying was Unexpected Courage supplemented by a handful of temporary readies depending on sphere (Behind Strong Walls or Desparate Defense).  If readying too much is a problem, you don't have to fix all readying cards at all -- you would just have to put "limit 1 per hero" on the very few non-unique/restricted attachments that provide repeatable readying, all of which were released before Beregond.  I'm not necessarily saying that the designers *should* do this, though it's the logical extension of TaBoromir's nerf.  It'd be a much bigger hit to SuperBeregond in 4-player than nerfing ABB, I think.  My point is rather that if the Miruvor/Erestor/UC combo providing up to seven defenses (and getting to key cards quickly) wasn't deemed "abusive" enough to fix in FAQ 1.8 and 1.9, I don't think the single ready from Magic Ring and the expensive setup of the Long Lake Trader combo remotely crosses the line for the next FAQ.  In terms of the common case, most new players have only a single Unexpected Courage anyways.

Google tells me that way back when FAQ 1.3 nerfed Beravor, making UC limit 1 per hero was suggested as an alternative errata.

It's known, because Caleb said as much when the combo was discovered, that the combo with Vanish from Sight was what triggered the Wandering Took errata.  But that Wandering Took had the *potential* for massive threat reduction from its lack of limits was demonstrated, even if not forseen in the core set, by the Earendil/Took/LoAragorn combo discovered and publicized way back in 2012.  I don't think it's a low blow to the designer's intelligence to suggest that *any* card released without limit should be assumed to be exercised in the future an arbitrary number of times in a single round or phase -- if that's deemed too strong, then it's too strong *at release*.

The comment I was replying to said that an errata is a statement that the card was too powerful, even in progression mode. But Earendil/LoAragorn were not available in progression mode.

Wanting more per-round restrictions is a reasonable position. But slapping a limit on everything under the sun is:

1. Ugly, as in many cases it would be redundant and confusing. Some confused guy: "Why does Erestor say 'Limit once per round' on his forced discard ability???". Developer: "Well, maybe some card in the future will make you trigger end of round effect multiple times, and then there might be cards further in the future that can be used to exploit that." Confused guy: "..."

2. Not necessarily effective. You can't predict what cards will come out years in the future, and the limit you set may not be low enough and require errata anyway.

3. Infeasible. It would require issuing an errata for more than half the cards in the card pool at this point. If the argument that these cards should have had limits to begin with, ok (see above 2 points), but this is not the fault of the current designer.

And yes, it's a low blow to the current designer to suggest that he is both saying A: "this card was broken to begin with" and B: "I only decided to errata this now". If instead we hold the designer in high regard, then only one of those statements can be true. And given that B is true, A must be false.

It is incredibly hard to design an expanding card game, with no rotation, with no promise of being the sole developer, that will experience no broken combos for almost a decade, and I feel like you are not giving the developers enough credit for the remarkable job they've done in limiting them.

Earendil/LoAragorn come online early in progression mode.  But (full confession) I didn't think the more powerful Took/Vanish combo was worth fixing with errata -- you can't "abuse" Wandering Took without passing it back and forth, which means anyone who gets his threat reduced with an unlimited Took is *cooperating* in doing so, and I don't see that as a problem to be fixed.  So I think Took should've only had his limit from the beginning *if* the designer felt that threat reduction was one of those things that needed to be *prevented* from being used in a loop.

I don't know the designers, but I think it's quite possible that Nate French and Caleb have different philosophies for this sort of thing.  How many cards that have been errata-ed by Caleb were designed by Caleb?

I'm not calling for a limit on "everything under the sun".  I'm calling for a limit on effects that would be problematic if recurred an arbitrary number of times.  Horn of Gondor generates resources and doesn't exhaust to do so -- a limit would be sensible.  Horn of Gondor aside, how many resource generators in the game *don't* have a limit?  All of the attachments do, I believe, and with WANI's nerf it may just be Traffic From Dale that can generate insane resources.  On the card side, with Legacy of Durin nerfed that just leaves Lord of Morthond and Rod of the Steward among attachments.

Now if you wanted to attack readying -- which I don't, but hypothetically suppose it was considered an errata worthy problem.  Slap "limit 1 per hero" on UC, Fast Hitch and Miruvor and "limit 1 per character" on Spare Hood and Cloak and you're done -- there's lots of readying cards, but almost all are *already* limited.

At this point in the game, it's rare to see a card that isn't limited in some way.

Please don't confuse criticism of errata with criticism of the state of the game or the qualities of the designer.  It's a minor irritant for me in a game that, I think, is better than ever.  Errata is the least of Caleb's jobs, and he managed to skip it completely in 2018 (which bothers me not at all).  *Most* of the errata, if you grant the need for errata, was well done and preserved the "common case".  And through 2017 power-level errata (though annoying to me) was affecting only a fraction of the powerful cards.  I hope that 2019 doesn't represent a change in philosophy, and when the next FAQ comes out we'll see if it has.

I'm from a wargame background, so I'm not coming in with the idea that errata is some sort of sin or bad reflection on a game -- it happens, and the more complex a game is the more likely it is to happen.  But from that same background I also come with the idea that errata is *not* another name for an optional rule, and that errata *always* has costs as well as benefits.

I thought your original point was ABB was the reason lore didn't get *sentinel* (protect multiplayer), not that the weakness of the specific Lore defense candidates was a result of ABB.  Still, while we agree that there's no good dedicated lore defenders (Radagast IMO will immediately become the best in that role despite his lack of useful traits), there's no way short of a statement from Caleb to know *why* there isn't.  I think it's more plausible that it's just seen as more of a leadership/tactics thing -- the two defense-ability spirit heroes both reduce threat, an exclusively spirit thing.  If we ever get a first class lore defender, I expect it to have some trigger with cards or healing or scrying, because that's lore's thing.

It's also worth remembering that when we talk about 3+ defense and sentinel, there's only three distinct heroes that qualify, period:  Beregond, Erkenbrand, and the recent Grimbeorn.  It's not remarkable at all that Lore is left out when there are so few.

Maybe cutting Ents out of ABB eligibility will lead to some better Lore allies worth putting ABB on.  Now that the ents have been cut out of the loop, there's not a lot of non-temporary characters who can take it with at least 2 def and 3 hp -- Haldir, Gildor (exhaust ability), Firyal (quest ability), and the new Mirkwood Hunter.  They also all cost 4+ now that the ents are excluded, though the last gets a discount.    By contrast, spirit has seven in that category and two of them cost less than 4.  Even neutral also has four, two of which are three cost (though Thalion can become Lore).  (For completeness, leadership has ten and tactics has six that can take restricted attachments -- clearly leadership is thought of as the defense sphere, as hero Elfhelm shows.) 

Maybe now that ABB is restricted and exhausts, we can get some way of giving allies Lore?  That'd be pretty sweet.

Ok so the problem is the delay between the release and the errata. That wasn't clear from your original comment. I'm just curious, do you have a time limit for when errata are acceptable, and beyond that you ignore them, or do you evaluate each errata on a case-by-case basis?

The Out of the Wild errata came out a long time after the card's release, but nobody complained as it's arguably a buff for the card, so I'm curious if you follow that one or not.

I actually don't disagree with most of your comments. I also think the Ered Mithrin cycle had the best player cards in a long time, while the Harad and Angmar Awakened quests remain my favorite. And I agree that Vilya and Outlands are overpowered, but I can see a good explanation for why that might be intended (Vilya, thematically, should be the strongest attachment in Middle-earth apart from the One Ring, and Outlands were designed for new players to feel powerful without a lot of deckbuilding).

One thing often ignored in the errata discussion is that we don't have the same picture of the card pool that the developer has. The game is developed years in advance. I wouldn't be surprised if the stuff they are playtesting right now won't even come out until 2021. So it could very well be that Caleb has already designed some more Dwarf cards, but they would make Dwarves way more powerful than the already are, so we are seeing some nerfs to old (and frankly overpowered) cards like Legacy of Durin. In the end, the errata may make room for more design space in the Dwarf swarm archtype that would make them fun to play again (I am tired of that mechanic myself). I would gladly take a hit on a couple cards, regardless of their age, if it allows an archetype to grow and become more interesting to play.

Meanwhile, maybe Noldor and Outlands will not see much development in the coming years, so he is leaving their power level alone (this is obviously all conjecture, as I am not a playtester).

My point is, if you've been playing this game for the last 5 years, you clearly must think Caleb is a good game designer, and has done a good job of piloting this ship we've all been on. When I see a content announcement, it is easy for me to trust that the new cards will be a good fit for the future card pool, given Caleb's track record. Now, why should the trust in his future vision stop at level of creating new content and not include the adjustment of current content? Who knows better where this ship is headed?

The rationale you find for the Outlands could be applied to any archetype, really. Why the dwarf swarm archetype would be different? Plus, the Outlands archetype does the same as a dwarf swarm archetype just faster and better. In your case, more than 25% of the decks you have published in Ringsdb use some sort of outland ally (typically Ethir and Anfalas). I guess you are not tired of this mechanic, but there are people who would like to see an errata on the outlands archetypem because frankly, they are reeeeally overpowered. Shall Caleb errate them?

The new Elvenking + Galadhrim Weaver combo shall be errated? Because Hama was errated to 3 time per game to avoid recurring events like fient and thicket of spears.

I, my self, am tired and bored of seeing decks with steward of gondor (which you use in about 50% of the decks you have published in Ringsdb), which is one of the most overpowered cards in the game. Shall it get an errata in order to make the game more challenging?

My answer to all of these questions is No. It is a collaborative game (and I hope it stays like this). There is really no need to make erratas, with the exception may be of those combos that create loops of infinite resources, card drawing and so on, which by the way they are not all corrected, you have a two-deck fellowship that generates infinite resources! Even in this case, a list of suggested erratas, like in Arkham Horror, is a more friendly way to go than an imposed errata appearing in the reprinted cards.

Ok, that is but my opinion which is obviously not shared by the developers 😀

And yes, I, like you, have full trust on Caleb game design skills.

Because in this case, the developers have stated their intention. On various podcasts Caleb has said that Outlands was designed for new players and for people who dislike deckbuilding to still be able to have a good time playing the game.

No, I think Outlands is supposed to be overpowered, as I said above. Just because some people want an errata is not enough reason to issue one, in the same way that just because some people don't want an errata is not enough reason for them not to issue one. It's the developer's decision.

The Weaver combo you're talking about requires an empty deck, which comes with a significant setup cost and maintenance penalty, unlike Hama. I don't see how these are comparable.

The idea of an errata for Steward has been brought up many times before. If I recall correctly, Caleb's stance (so far) has been that it is essential for new players to help them through the core set and first few cycles, so he is not inclined to nerf it.

What if Legacy of Durin creates an infinite loop with some future card that is designed but not yet released? Would you prefer to have the errata come pre-emptively, or wait until after it's released and the community has had some time to exploit it?

I have some problems with the Arkham Horror "taboo list" concept, but that is a whole other discussion.

1) Sorry to say but the Outlands argument that Caleb wields is pathetic (I was not aware of it), still it does not justify why it cannot be the same treatment for dwarfs?

2) For the combo of Elven King + Galadhrim weaver you need to empty your deck (or have recurrent powerful scrying like Mirror of Galadriel). How many rounds do you need to empty your deck with Sp Dain? With Dain and Erestor? That is how they are comparable.

3) I really love the argument on Steward of Gondor!

4) Regarding the errata of the Legacy of Durin, I definitively would prefer to see this "infinite combo" before the errata comes. All this pre-emptive errata give me the shivers, bad things have been done in the name of "pre-emptiveness". Besides, there is already a loop for infinite resources that you have created, will it get an errata?

But it is really a pointless discussion. Caleb will keep doing erratas, somo of us don't (and won't) like that the erratas are forced on us through re-prints, but they will keep coming.

Im so glad to see this change. A simple 1 cost repeatable effect that completely avoids travel costs is overpowered and poor design. Look at the second quest from Shadow in the East; Thrors map completely breaks that quest. 

Thank you Caleb for fixing this broken card and others like the ridiculously overpowered burning brand.

I'm looking athe second quest from Shadow in the East.  If you have Thror's Map (requires playing Lore), you can avoid the following travel effects:

1) Hillside Manor -- random discard from hand

2) City Forum -- raise threat 1 per each resource on it (gets resources only when active location is explored)

3) Side Street -- replacement location from deck added

4) Catacombs -- each discard card from encounter deck, if enemy it is engaged.

Catacombs scales against more players, but 3+ players means location control is already a priority and there's only two in deck.  Side Street seems nasty and is required at game start -- but you advance in the quest by exploring *active* locations -- ensuring another location to travel to next turn can actually help the player.  City Forum's only raises by 1 if you go there first chance.  Hillside Manor just discards a random card.  These are annoying effects that would make packing Thror's Map worth including in a deck, if you're playing Lore, which isn't true for a lot of quests.  But those aren't *remotely* game-losing effects that cause the quest to be broken if you somehow avoid them.  If playing Lore I'd add Thror's Map, but I certainly wouldn't mulligan for it.

Now it's certainly true that Thror's Map is a cheap repeatable way of avoiding travel costs, which is exactly what it was designed to be and what it was long-ago errata-ed to be.  You may correctly say that the existence of Thror's Map reduces the popularity of Strider's Path, or that it precludes a lesser, non-repeatable travel avoider or a more expensive travel avoider.

But here's the thing -- look at those travel effects again.  Is it worth a deck slot *and* a lore resource to avoid one of those effects?  I don't think so.  Lesser cards are blocked not by Thror's Map because they are lesser, but because they are inherently weak. Thror's Map was a useful sideboard card for literally years; now it is a coaster.  And for what?  So you can rejoice in the moral purity of a quest where a tool is taken away to control what happens?  So you can deprive *other players* of a card you yourself were *never* required to play?  So players with a limited card pool starting the game late in his life -- the people who are currently getting this card that veterans got many years ago -- have one less arrow in the quiver?  So the exciting world of forced travel effects can be opened up for the whopping six remaining known quests, as if there weren't past quests featuring obnoxious "Forced: when X becomes the active location" when experiencing travel effects was *actually* "necessary"?

I appreciate that the designers have to errata card sometimes to remove "broken" combos that a single player could induce in pick-up multiplayer, though I've always advocated that such fixes should be designed to preserve the common usage of a card.  I totally reject the idea that the designers should, years later, deside to nerf non-broken powerful cards to protect the integrity of quests from players.  *That's* what I call bad design.

If they were going to make it so useless, the least they could've done is attach it to the location when used, so that the woodmen could get powered up.

@dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/]

I dont plan to argue long over this, I understand that you feel the way you do.

But the designers didn't decide to give this card errata because it was underpowered. And lets be honest; Caleb and the team know better than you or me what is best for this game. I trust them and appretiate their work, as Im sure you do as well.

Im also not sold that more people like the old card as you say, there are several members on this forum that have expressed otherwise.
