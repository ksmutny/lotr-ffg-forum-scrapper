thanks to the user who pointed this out in the other thread.

 

looks like we miss the old forest and barrow downs :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] however we see midgewater marsh, prancing pony inn and weathertop...all great areas :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

also interesting to see a lifetracker use of the threat tracker!

 

finally for those who want interesting choices, flight to the ford has them! you can use cards which end the quest easier, but given burdens later on....genius!

thanks caleb (and nate again!)

Missing them out seems like a missed opportunity for variety.  (at the same time - they are quite tangential to the saga as a whole, so maybe we'll see those areas as PoD or future cycles instead - much like I hope to get a PoD expansion of escaping Thrandrill's realm).

I think that all this discussion about Bombadil being relevant as a character is quite useless. I'm pretty sure without any doubt that we'll eventually see him in the game, the question is when, and how. After all, he's part of the story, and a very interesting one at that, whether people like him or not. Not seeing him would be like cutting any other character from the game because he/she is unpopular. And considering Caleb Grace and the design team are clearly fans of the books and know every little detail and name from the world of Middle Earth and want to expand on them (that's why I do believe we'll see the Ithryn Luin at some point (copyrights permit), as well as the cultures from Harad and the far east) I think it's a given we'll see Bombadil in the game. Now, whether he'll be an objective, an ally or whatever (I think he'll be both by the time this game is done) is subject to pure baseless speculation. But to me, the (possible) fact that we won't see him in the Black Riders means only that he will be in a future cycle.

i don't think having a discussion on tolkien and the books in a forum about a game based on tolkien's books is usless at all. it's part of the fun and draw of the game, after all.

 

not everything has to be about game play or "useful" to every person reading a given thread.

 

it's the snide, holier-than-thou comments that are "quite useless."

i am a bit on the side of not wanting pod packs. they are good for getting content that wouldnt be able to be released normally, but something like this should be in the main packs. i can understand bombadil isnt for everyone, but anyone who has ever interacted with the tolkien fan base should know he is a fan favourite, and i hope the designers recognise that (i will be surprised if they dont as its obvious caleb and the other designers are knowledgeable about tolkien)
