If hero has boons (permanent and non) and that hero dies, but you return him to play via cards, do you lose boons attached to him? I assume permanents go right back on him, but I assume others, like Three Golden Hairs, stay in your discard pile, yet are available to you for the next quest... but I'm not sure, so thought I'd ask.

Official answer from Caleb I've once received (regarding permanent boons):

 

Q: When I sacrifice a hero on the Great Bridge and that hero has permanent boon attached, what happens with this boon card when I bring that hero back to play by Fortune or Fate? Is it again attached to him? In rules there is written: “If a hero leaves play, attachments with the permanent keyword attached to that hero are removed from the game", so maybe this boon is lost for good, as it is not just discarded but removed?
A: In that situation, the permanent attachment is removed from the game, but not from the campaign pool. It will be reattached at the beginning of the next scenario.

Good to know. I'll treat non-permanents the same. Thanks.

So I guess it should be "If a hero leaves play [and doesn't return to play before the quest ends], attachments with the..."

No, if they leave play remove the boon from the game. They are not removed from the campaign.
