The card states: "When Revealed: Attach this card to the hero with the highest threat cost without a copy of Local Trouble attached. (Counts as a condition attachment with the text: "When attached hero exhausts, readies, or triggers an ability, raise its controller's threat by 1.")

My hero who has the highest threat happens to be Beorn. Beorn states, "cannot have attachments." Does this mean the card is simply discarded? Or, is there a distinct difference between "player attachment cards" and "encounter deck condition attachment cards?" I am quite confused on this one. Thanks!

I wasn't sure about this either, so I asked Caleb. Here is his answer:

 

> Hi Jörg,
> Because Beorn cannot have attachments, he is not a legal target for Local Trouble so you will have to choose a different hero to attach it to. For example, if your heroes are Beorn, Theoden, Hama and Local Trouble is revealed, you would have to attach it to Theoden. If another Local Trouble is revealed, then you would have to attach it to Hama.
> Cheers,

And I had so much hoped to make this scenario a bit easier...
