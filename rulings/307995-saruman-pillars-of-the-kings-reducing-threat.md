# [Saruman + Pillars of the Kings &quot;reducing&quot; threat](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307995-saruman-pillars-of-the-kings-reducing-threat/)

Hero Saruman's effect states that any time a player card effect would reduce your threat by any amount, that amount is reduced to 1. Pillars of the Kings says toÂ setÂ your threat level equal to 40. So what would happen if I'm playing Saruman and my threat is 48 and I play Pillars of the Kings? Does my threat become 40, or does the game somehow recognize that in this case my threat is being reduced and so it would only be reduced by 1 to become 47 threat?

My gut tells me thatÂ settingÂ is fundamentally different fromÂ reducing, so it would still be set to 40. After all, I'm not reducing my threat by any fixed amount. However I also recognize that this may break the way Saruman is meant to be played, so I figured I'd check :)

I am pretty sure Caleb has already ruled that Pillar of Kings setting your threat down from 4X to 40 is still considered "threat reduction", so it won't work well with Saruman

Indeed, there is this ruling:

As Ramshackle Manor and hero Saruman have essentially identical wording re: threat reduction, the OP's attempt to get around Saruman's drawback won't work.
