Anyone know if you can use A Good Harvest to pay for 0 cost cards that DO NOT match any of your heroes' spheres? 

 

A Good Harvest:

 

Action: Name a sphere. Until the end of the phase, you can spend resources of any sphere when paying for cards that belong to the named sphere.

 

Technically, the player is not spending resources when paying for a 0 cost card, and in the core rules, it is stated that to play a 0 cost card, you must have a hero with a matching sphere.  According to my reading of the card and rules, I must assume I CAN NOT pay for 0 cost cards with A Good Harvest, but I haven't seen a ruling on it.

 

Anyone?

Official Ruling...

 

"A Good Harvest does not allow players to play 0 cost cards without a resource match. Since you are not using any resources to pay for the card, the ability of A Good Harvest does not apply and you still need a resource match.

Cheers,

> I think the intention of A Good Harvest is clear: you can pay for cards of any sphere. Why zero cost cards should not be included requires a very good explanation (hint: there is none).

I agree with you here cose you are very logic. But Caleb change his mind alraeady couple of times about other things so let him think a bit more and who know....?

 

Same loragorn +desperade alliance. This will be too broken and with new Doom player cards from Isengard expansion will be crazy powerful.  He will change his mind i suppose.
