If a shadow card poisons the defending character and that character becomes unconscious is he still defending or is the attack considered undefended ?…thanks !

I checked with Caleb, and he said that if a defender becomes unconscious during an attack, the attack is undefended.

Well, I faced the situation in my last two games, and indeed it felt more logical to rule this way.

The thing is to consider that "defending" is not only the act of declaring a defender, but also resolving the defense.

This is pretty evil, because when you face a 5 attack and try to block with a weak ally (1 or 2 hit points), not only you lose the ally defender (unconscious), but then you have to deal 5 damages to a hero (undefended), and also add the extra poison to this hero (which usually turns to a dead or unconscious hero).

Official response:

If a card is immune to the effect that is seeking a target, then the card with immunity would is ineligible to be targeted. For example, the hero Beorn cannot be chosen as a target for a treachery effect with the text "attach to a hero" because he has the text "cannot have attachments." That treachery must be attached to a different hero instead.
In the case of unconscious characters and poison: each quest stage in that scenario explains that unconscious characters cannot be poisoned, so each unconscious character is an ineligible target for poison.

So pretty much what I suspected. Nice to have it confirmed.
