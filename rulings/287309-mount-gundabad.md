FWIW I'm in general agreement with @dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/]'s interpretation here, that we have "read access" to encounter cards, regardless of Immune status. What's problematic for Tilbo is that he uses the word "choose", which, as has been pointed out, is specifically called out in the FAQ on Immunity.

We'll see what Caleb says. I suppose this could've come up before in the setting of Fatty and a player who wanted to raise his threat off an Immune enemy, but shockingly, I couldn't find anyone bringing up that particular issue before… ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I think this is supposed to represent him in the Hobbit timeline though. I mean, it would make little sense to have a young Bilbo running around with Sam and Merry, but then again you can have Thorin and Thorin III in the same deck, same as with the Bard's. I think Caleb just wanted to make a new Bilbo that depicted him in his most iconic role, the protagonist of The Hobbit, and I applaud him for that. He even gave him the Burglar trait.

As Thorin died at the Battle of Five Armies, Orcrist was placed on his tomb, together with the Arkenstone. The Necklace of Girion was given to Bard the Bowman in exchange for the Arkenstone, who then gave it to Thranduil. The necklace and the stone were both guarded by Smaug. And Thrór's Ring was taken from his son in the Dungeons of Dul Guldur by Sauron himself. So technically all of the Guarded artifacts are already in the possession of some heroes or Sauron.

At this point it seems Caleb just decided to make the iconic artifacts of Middle Earth (minus the One Ring sadly) to just be playable in regular decks, despite timeline issues, and I can't agree more with it. So no, I don't think there's a contrived lore reason for us being able to have Orcrist or the Arkenstone. The reason is that Orcrist is a classic, iconic Tolkien weapon and it just had to be in the game as a playable card. Honestly, I would aboslutely love a One Ring player card (be it guarded or otherwise).
