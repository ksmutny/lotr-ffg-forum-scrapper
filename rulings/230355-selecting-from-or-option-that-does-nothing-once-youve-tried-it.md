# [Selecting from OR option that does nothing once you&#039;ve tried it](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230355-selecting-from-or-option-that-does-nothing-once-youve-tried-it/)

I know if you have an "OR" option you have to pick one that "must be performed in full, if able" (faq 1.44), but what of this instance...

 

I drew "Marching up the Road" in Journey to the Crossroads quest in the Land of Shadow saga. It says, "When Revealed: Each player must either return an enemy engaged with him to the staging area, or search the encounter deck for a Harad enemy and put it into play engaged with him."

 

I'm playing 2 handed. For deck 1, I decided to search the encounter deck for an enemy, but found there wasn't one. Now do I have to take the alternate and return an enemy to the staging area? Or because I selected an option, yet it happened to do nothing, am I fine? If that's ok, I assume for the 2nd deck I can opt to do the same, but wanted to double check. Thanks in advance.

I agree with all of you... though apparently, Caleb doesn't. His response to my email...

I've replied to his email, asking him to please look at this thread and weigh in as to why this is the case. Because the more I think about it, the more it doesn't feel intuitive. I really dislike the idea of selecting an option, and if nothing concrete comes of it, you dismiss it and choose another option. I have to believe in the history of past quests, there are instances where this would be goofy. It seems to me there is one quest where you can choose to reveal the top card of the encounter deck, and you take a penalty based off the threat. Ring a bell for anyone? If so, then by this ruling, if you reveal a treachery card, then it has 0 threat and you take no penalty, in which case, you are must choose the other option. That just feels wrong and takes away the tension of hoping it's 0.

 

Or maybe I'm wrong about that one, but seems there must be something similar somewhere.

I wrote Caleb about game state changing (and even gave example where you previously peeked at multiple cards atop the encounter deck, but now the order changed so this is double whammy as that knowledge is gone and you still should carry out other option) but he stuck with the ruling.

I looked back through other encounter cards and found choices of pulling enemy from encounter deck. Pretty sure if I ever took that option in the past and there was no enemy, I considered it good luck. I just don't know... this may be first time I go against on official LotR LCG ruling as it doesn't sit well with me at all... though I hate the very idea. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

> Good to know... as I thought, this was a question for the developers.  Your community responders were not able to divine the answer to this one!

to be completely honest, this doesn't actually follow the logical parse of how one should interact with this situation. it seems that the golden rule of 'do the thing that's worst for the players' is what Caleb was going on for this.

because now he has to reconcile more explicitly what it means to 'complete in full, if able' for these OR decisions

i also don't think this will come up ever probably anyway, but i don't agree with the ruling.
