OK. After I place the 7th progress token…according to the FORCED, The Carrock becomes the active location and I discard the previous active location…if I have enough willpower to place the 6 progress tokens on this location (The Carrock), as a continuation of the quest phase that I placed the 7th progress token on, BEFORE flipping to stage 2 of this quest?

I am trying to plan ahead here…if I end up with at least 7 progress tokens to place (1 to complete Stage 1B of Grimbeorn's Quest), and then 6 to immediately complete the new Carrock location, will this work?

At this point, I can flip to Stage 2B (Against the Trolls) and avoid the +1 Att and +1 Def. for the Carrock being the active location.

Thanks!

I have submitted a rule question and got the following reply from Caleb Grace:

Hi Angus,
There is no "carry over" progress when you complete a quest stage. If you made 13 progress and the quest needed only 7, the other six have no effect and are discarded when you advance to the next stage.
Cheers,
Caleb

So I place the first 7 tokens on the quest card 1B and trigger its Forced effect, and the Carrock becomes the active location. Since I still have 6 progress tokens to be placed and there is now an active location, do I place these tokens on the active location, or should I change to the next quest card and thus lose those progress tokens since they cannot be carried forward to next quest stage?
 

And it is similar in the Redhorn Gate:

This is the same language as Grimbeorn's Quest and will be treated the same.

So there is no placing of progress tokens on the just-become-active-location.  Thank you Caleb!
