Dear FFG

 

LotR LCG is one of my favourite games, but the card ratios in the core set are so frustrating. Could you please consider releasing a Print on Demand booster pack that contains extra copies of all the cards of which there are fewer than three copies in the core set?

 

I, for one, would happily buy such a product to get play-sets of all those cards. I know many players have shelled out for a second (and even a third) core set, but I have a limited gaming budget and I primarily play solo. As such, a second core set represents limited value for money for me (and wouldn't even get me full play-sets). Being able to pick up those cards alone would add to my core set deck-building options without breaking the bank.

 

I hope you will consider my idea as a cost effective solution to what is a relatively common player gripe.

 

Whitman

 

PS: Thanks to richsabre, who suggested moving this from the Print on Demand section to here.

the forum wasnt working for me for some reason.....brings me back to the times of waiting 2 hours for a page to load haha

 

i have to agree with mr.thomasschmidt on this one- i don't think ffg will do this, no matter of the support or anything. not that ffg dont listen to their players, they most certainly do (they even made the subforums after i started a petition) but on this one, i think its too much of a 'sticky' area (dont ask me what i mean by that as i dont really know) .

 

what really matters i think is the amount of players who buy the game but dont go further than that i.e. dont post on forums, dont follow the news apart from new release schedules and so on. being so obsessed with this game its hard to imagine it, but i guess a lot of ffg's player base are happy to own and buy the game and leave it at that...im also thinking of the players who have the game and bring it out once or twice per month/year

 

...therefore, it is not even sure how many would join a campaign to get these extra packs. it is also unsure how these 'basic' players would feel about such a thing....im guessing most would not have an opinion either way enough to back it

 

personally it is risky...perhaps just ask caleb outright whitman? you can contact ffg, see what they think...they may say its not likely to ever happen, they may say it depends on sales..i really dont know
