Hi guys,

I know that this has been commented in the past but I still have a doubt.

The faq indicates that Feint should be played any time before resolving step 1 of the target enemy’s attack during the combat phase. (Once the act of resolving an enemy’s attack begins, it is too late to prevent it from attacking with Feint.)

It's clear.

But is the shadow card dealt?, I understand that it wouldn't be resolved.

Regards,

If he attacks in principle he is engaged, or so Caleb said
