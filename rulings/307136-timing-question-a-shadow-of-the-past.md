Hi guys,

During the quest step, the following cards come up due to the surge keyword:

1. Have you seen Bagging! (Peril + Surge + When Revealed effects)

2. Lure of the ring (Surge + When Revealed effects)

3. Black Rider (Hide 2 + Forced effects)

In this case, after the peril + surge effects on the first card are resolved, what would be the next effect (effects) to be resolved?:

- the surge effect on the second card?
- the surge effect on the second card + the hide 2 + the forced effects on the third card (hide test failed)?
- the when revealed effect on the first card?

I understand that the passive effects are resolved first but I also read that all the effects on a card should be resolved before to proceed with the next card, I think I'm confused. 

Regards,

You can choose to resolve the attack first, but you will have to resolve Have You Seen Baggins at the first opportunity, which is at the beginning of the first action window created by the new attack - this is also your first opportunity to use any when engaged responses etc.

I am not sure, cause I think you have to wait to fully resolve the first Forced effect before proceding to (eventually) resolve the second Forced. Generally speaking Forced effects do not interrupt each other until they are fully resolved (I remember some stuff about that regarding some Burdens and The Lonely Mountain quest)

But you can definitely not use any Responses until the Forced attack is resolved (quoting an answer from Caleb about SpPippin), even though you have the usual Action windows opened for an attack.

The Rider will engage you (passive) and attack (Forced) and there is no opportunity to trigger Pippin's Response between those two things. After the attack resolves would be your first opportunity to trigger Pippin's ability to return the Rider to the staging area, which you could do at that time. That can still be helpful since it will prevent the Rider from attacking during the combat phase, but there really is no way to stop a Rider from attacking when you fail a hide test.

Ah, so Caleb went back on his Response ruling that makes me feel a lot better, I'm not going crazy.

Seems like there was no explicit ruling on the Forced effect issue, but I assume you would treat it the same way - ie, trigger it as soon as possible in the action window. That's the interpretation that I will continue to use.

Triggering multiple immediate attacks as in the example adds more complication, but I suppose there are a couple of ways you could rationalise it: either the second forced effect triggers during the action window of the first attack and "lines up" the second attack for afterwards; or once you trigger the first attack the second effect isn't eligible to trigger until after its done, at which point the "trigger at the first available opportunity" time occurs and you get the second attack. I'm not sure there's a practical difference between the two, but I think I prefer the former.

I submitted this case to Caleb to get a more specific answer about Forced effects, immediate attacks and so forth. I will share any answer as soon as I get it

So here is Caleb answer to this specific question, which confirms that you have to resolve the second Forced as soon as possible, in this case just after the Rider attack initiates

The Hide Test is a failure (Hero A is still ready), the constant effect of the quest has the Rider engage us then both the Condition and the Black Rider Forced are triggered. From previous rulings we can choose the order to resolve them, but when does the second one come into play? Can we choose the Black Rider attack first, defend with Hero A, getting it killed to avoid the Condition Forced? Or as soon as we have an action window in the immediate attack the Condition Forced takes place (and in that case can we trigger Responses after that or those are still after the whole attack?) Or some other situation?
