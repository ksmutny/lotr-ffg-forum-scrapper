 OK,  the event that was scheduled was cancelled.  What was going to happen was not revealed.  The resources that were to be used did not arrive.  At least that was the impression that I got.  Instead, Caleb Grace had a Q&A with the eight or nine players that showed up.

Each of us did receive a playmat and deck box with LOTR LCG theme.  That was cool.

I got the feeling, and have no proof at all, that HON is due out very soon.

I will fill you in on our discussion with Caleb this week when I can use a key board rather my phone.
