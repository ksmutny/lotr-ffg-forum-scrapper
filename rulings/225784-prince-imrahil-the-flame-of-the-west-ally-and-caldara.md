It was brought up in a few different threads about the spoiled Prince Imrahil from the Flame in the West box and how his ability works/doesn't work with Caldara.  Figured instead of hunting those threads I'd just start a new one in the proper spot.

 

 

Prince Imrahil is an ally with the conditional passive text: While there is a hero card in your discard pile, Prince Imrahil loses the ally card type and gains the hero card type.

 

Caldara has the action ability: Discard Caldara to put 1 spirit ally from your discard pile into play for each other hero you control with a printed spirit resource icon.

 

I went ahead and asked Caleb how these two interact with the scenario that my 3 starting heroes have the printed spirit icon, one is Caldara, the Prince Imrahil ally is in play and is still an ally.  Then, I trigger Caldara's ability.  How many allies do I get out of the discard pile?    And here is his response:

 

Hi Benjamin,
Prince Imrahil’s text is a passive effect that is constantly checking the game state to see if there is a hero in your discard pile, so the instant that Caldara is placed in your discard pile he becomes a hero. As for Caldara, the cost to trigger her effect is to place her in the discard pile, and you cannot trigger an effect without paying the cost first. So, you must discard Caldara before you can resolve the rest of her effect. That means Imrahil is a hero at the time that you calculate how many allies you put into play, which means you can get up to 3 allies into play with Caldara’s effect (or even 4 if you make a unique spirit ally a hero with Sword-thain first).
Cheers,
Caleb

I've asked about this before.

 

The question I asked was: "My question is about triggering an ability where paying the cost would invalidate the ability. I realise that's very vague so an example: Cold from Angmar is attached to a quest card and I play Quickbeam. If I trigger his response, dealing a damage to ready him, his text box becomes blank because he's damaged. Do I get to finish resolving the response since I already started doing it, or does his blank text box cut in so as soon as I deal the damage the rest of the response is no longer there to be resolved. This would apply similarly to triggering a Derndingle Warrior, hero Treebeard or Erkenbrand with Cold from Angmar in play. A more extreme example could arise where the interfering factor is the game framework rather than even a passive on a card - if I deal damage to Beechbone for his ability, and that damage is enough to kill him, does he die instantly, or do I still get to finish the response and deal damage to the enemy? Or does he die, then I get to finish resolving the ability but it does nothing since he's dead and has no damage?"

 

And Caleb's response was: "If a character's ability is part of the same sentence as the trigger, such as Quickbeam’s, then you should resolve the ability before treating that character’s text box as blank."
