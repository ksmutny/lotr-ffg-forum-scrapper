I think that while she might cut back her work for FFG - a girl's got to eat after all -  I have a hunch she feels a bit of attachment to her Noldor portfolio and we will still see her work from time to time.

 

Caleb and Matt alluded to this in the video interview at GenCon as well.

Many audio and video interviews with Caleb by Team Covenant and COTR. They explcitly said they gave Legolas dark hair for this reason, as well as mentioned that sometimes they have to ask the artist to "change it up a bit, dress it a little different" becuase it looks to much like the movies, and when asked about the influence of Peter Jackson's movies in general Caleb has said that "the books are the books, the movies are the movies, they're kind of two different things".
