When playing the Black Riders campaign, is it possible to have the ally and the boon versions of Gildor Inglorion in play at the same time?

 

The unique rule on page 8 of the rulebook only affects cards played by players. So if I were to play my ally copy of Gildor, and then the boon version is then revealed off the top of the deck, both copies are then legally in play.

 

Or is there a rule I'm overlooking that can prevent this  weirdness?

I was worried you'd reference that rule, because I don't have a great answer.  You could argue that the card isn't "being played" because it's an encounter card that is "being revealed".  I would definitely just discard it instead of breaking the system, but feel free to email Caleb if you want a more official answer.

 

EDIT: This question has in fact come up before and Gildor is discarded.  There isn't discussion of that particular rule, but it is an official answer: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/13683412#13683412 [https://boardgamegeek.com/article/13683412#13683412]
