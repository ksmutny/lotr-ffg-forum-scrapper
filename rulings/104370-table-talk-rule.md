Someone suggested a separate post about this rule so here it is.

Do you follow this rule? Are you saying 'ambush Ishtari' instead of sneak attack gandalf.

If you are following the rulebook then the former is allowed and not the later. Moreover this makes playing two handed solo completely illegal and cheating.

Any thoughts on this?

Adhering to the rules is grand and I do it plenty myself, but it will only prop you up until the winds change.  Caleb has been quoted before acknowledging 2-handed play as a popular, but unsupported, variant.  It will take only a general FAQ release to deflate righteous fury here, so just watch that you aren't too invested in your own arguments regarding propriety and cheating.
