At the starting of the quest of a game, there was Thalin commited and it was played Expecting Mischief:

The first card revealed was an enemy with only 1hp.

 

The question is: is valid deal the damage by Thalin text and keep Expecting Mischief for next cards?

> Not that I can remember it explicitly stated anywhere but the wording "reveal and add it to the staging area" which is a fairly common used phrase on some encounter cards, suggests to me that it is added after resolving keywords and when-revealed abilities.

But sometimes they only use the wording "reveal" which Caleb confirmed to be the same as "reveal and add..." - so it's technically happening at the same time.

 

Thalin's ability is a special case because it isn't a response. We had the same discussion about Thalin and Eastern Crows' "surge" effect which led to an entry in the FAQ that Thalin's ability comes first. So it should also trigger before any "response" or "when revealed" effect takes place.
