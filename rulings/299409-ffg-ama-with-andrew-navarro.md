Hey everyone, there's a chance to ask the head of FFG Studios anything you want about any game! He'll be answering some of the questions on the FFG live stream this Friday

Next iteration of the game? At least it's not a second edition, but what could a "next iteration" mean? Slower release schedule like boxes only, no cycles? Crossovers with the digital offerings? Cleaned up rules, as a revised edition but fully compatible? New core set and player facing expansions like a premade deck ready to go and then quest packs similar to Marvel LCG? Return to "X" like expansions? Bundled content so there's less SKUs on the market? Competitive mode being default but expanded?

And them taking a break before the new iteration has my cynical self thinking they'll be shuffling around designers, maybe Caleb will jump ship to Marvel similar to what Matt did for Arkham? Hmm... I'm cautiously optimistic. And I guess this is the last cycle? Or do you think we'll see another one squeezed in before now and late 2020?

I hope that with all this, at least Caleb won’t have the time to release more erratas.

Obviously all the “erratas allow to open new card development strategies” argument is not valid anymore.

I have now watched the video and put myself in the “cautiously optimistic “ category.  Caleb has talked about bringing more of a story telling or saga style element into the game and maybe that’s what’s being envisioned here.

Regarding the 2.0 vs 1b argument, put me firmly in the 1b category.  I’m not saying the game is perfect, but I don’t believe the game’s problems are structural.  Yes, Spirit and Lore got too much of the color pie and Tactics and Leadership didn’t get enough, but I don’t believe that can’t be handled with errata or future cards.  I do not want to go back to the very limited card pool we had for so many years.  Furthermore, if there was a complete reboot people would be wanting the sagas all over and I don’t think the designers really want to go back there again.

I dont really play LotR that much. Mostly when a friend brings it out.

What is the difference in the pies?
