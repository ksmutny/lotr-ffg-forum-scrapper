What do you guys think would happen if you play Revealed in Wrath on the Brown Water Rats from Journey Along the Anduin Nightmare?

Revealed in Wrath: Action: Choose a non-unique enemy. Until the end of the phase, treat the chosen enemy's printed text box as if it were blank (except for Traits).

 

The Brown Water Rats have a null value (indicated by the hyphen) for their hit points. They have the text "Brown Water Rats cannot be damaged".

It's clear that the rats can be damaged after blanking their text with Revealed in Wrath. But since they have a null value for their hit points, should they be discarded immediately after blanking their text box?

Seems like something to ask Caleb.
