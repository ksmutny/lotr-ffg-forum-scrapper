We know from the latest article that Noldor will be a focus in upcoming packs next to the Rangers. This got me thinking about traits.

If we do see a Cirdan hero (it fits the area, and would be a reason to give us Narya), will he have the Sindar trait? Legolas and Celeborn are traited Silvan, which has always bugged me a little. I would rather they made Cirdan a Noldo than Silvan - I'm finding it hard to believe they're creating a new elf trait for him at this point. I realise you can't have too many traits floating around. Has Matt, Caleb or someone else ever addressed this?
