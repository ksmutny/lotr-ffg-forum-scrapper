I just wanted to put an official response here for people that search in the future.  There was a question about whether or not you could use Erkenbrand's ability with damage cancellation like Honour Guard or Raven-Winged Helm.  Here is the official answer:

 

> Hi Jim,
> When a player uses a Response to cancel an effect, the result is that the canceled effect never resolves. For example, when a player uses A Test of Will to cancel the ‘when revealed’ effects of The Necromancer’s Reach, the players do not deal 1 damage to each character in play and then remove 1 damage from each character in play. Instead, no damage is dealt.
> Similarly, if you use the Response effect on Raven-winged Helm to cancel the damage just dealt to Erkenbrand after triggering his Response effect, you do not place 1 damage on Erkenbrand and then remove it. Instead, the damage is not dealt at all. In which case, his cost has not been paid and you cannot resolve his effect.
> Visually, it looks like this:
> Damage is dealt by effect ——> Response effect cancels damage dealt ——> No damage is actually dealt
> Cheers,
> Caleb
