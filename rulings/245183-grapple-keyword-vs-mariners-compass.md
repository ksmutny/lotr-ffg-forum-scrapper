If I mariners compass (switch) a location with anÂ enemy grappled to it, what happens to the enemy. Do I discard it or does it attach to the new location in play?

I would send that question to Caleb as I don't think that anyone will have a definitive answer. I don't believe that there is any ruling on that at the moment.

Thanks for the reply's thankfully the scenario in question never came up as Mariners compass was discarded due to a shadow effect prior to stage 3b. Nevertheless we were able to save the storm caller. I hope this specific question is addressed in a new FAQ. I will also email Caleb in regards to it to find out for sure. thanks again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
