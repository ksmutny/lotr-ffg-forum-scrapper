Several encounter cards in the Black Riders expansion have effects using the wording "put [...] enemy into play engaged with the first player" (ex: "The Prancing Pony").

 

When this happens, does it grant an opportunity to trigger Sam Gamgee's response "After you engage an enemy [...]" ?

 

The wording "engaged" would let me think the actual "engaging" action didn't happened (as if it was already there from a previous turn), so would not provide an opportunity to trigger the response.

 

I have submitted this question to ffg, but I'd also like to get your interpretation of this.

Thanks.

Received an official ruling from Caleb:

 

> Any time an enemy ends up in your play area, engaged with you, it has engaged you and you have engaged it. It doesn't matter if it comes from the staging area, the encounter deck, discard pile, or even out of play: if it ends up in your play area, it has engaged you. And if that enemy's engagement cost is higher than your threat, Sam's ability will trigger at that time.
