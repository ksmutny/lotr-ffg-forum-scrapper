Apparently somehow we got Crossings of Poros spoilers before Black Serpent... weird, but I'll take it. This is probably already my favorite pack of the cycle, and those who've read my posts anticipating certain themes will instantly recognize why. So without further adue and needless to say SPOILERS AHEAD

For some reason the forums don't let me directly put the images from Imgur, if someone can help it'll be greatly appreciated.

If anyone was still curious on a Quickbeam ruling now that the pack is out, I sent the question in to FFG, just to be sure:

IMO the delay was essentially a spacing out of the packs so that there wasn't a huge gap between Crossings and Rhovanion.  Caleb has been busy working on the digital version of the game and there are only so many hours in the day.  Prepare for a new normal.

With the Saga releases complete and not being replaced with other content (unless you count the digital game), I think we're going to end up with a two month gap between releases going forward, double what it was in the past. This is sort of expected, since we had 1.5 developers working on the card game (100% of Caleb's time and 50% of Matt's time), we now have about 0.75 developers working on it. So while the game still has a long life ahead, I think we will have to unfortunately get used to longer intervals between content.
