this is certainly not a new topic, but i did want to see other's thoughts on it.

through out this game, the encounter cards have gotten steadily tougher to deal with, this i understand and its of course neccessary to counter increasingly powerful player cards (dont worry this isnt a thread about power creep)

as enemies get higher stats, and locations higher threat and progress points, i see new cards that help to overcome this, and everything to me at least appears balanced….player cards arent too powerful that quests are too easy, and the enemies and locations arent too hard that its impossible to win without a great deal of luck

…..however, i do not see this happening with treachery cards. for instance early on in the game a card that said something like 'each player must search the encounter deck/discard pile for 1 enemy of his choice and add to staging' would have been relatively rare, and would be seen as a tough card to deal with, without the likes of test of will….

but now, there are several of these, and they are in every new pack quest. not only this, but i see a large increase in the number of cards with surge on. to me surge is an irritating keyword that increases the luck factor of the game, and there is little ways to deal with them apart from the risk some light and denethor if you are in a solo game.

so my point is, that we need more cards like test of will. do not misunderstand me, im not crying out for a 'deal with all' treachery cancellation card. we have test of will for that. but it must be noted that in the core set there were only 2 of these. if you are playing a 2 handed game with 1 core set thats 2 treachery cancellation cards for everyone.

there are of course more indirect ways to deal with this as ive noted above….risk some light and denethor….and there is still elanor, but the point remains, if you get a treachery, especially a treachery with surge, there is so few ways to deal with them compared to the number of them in each quest….

indeed, added to this, i should probably say that a pair of my decks i usually run with (1 mono tactics, the other lore/spirit) can easily deal with most of the early quests (pre numenor/hobbit 1) and win without any real trouble i would say 90% of the time.

when i play them against any of the numenor or hobbit quests however, they get destroyed. 9/10 times it is due to surge and treachery cards. i dont even think this is down to the decks not being built well for the quests…the decks can handle just about any type of quest (apart from rhosgobel).

so yes, to sum up i would like some more cards that deal with treachery cards….not even directly, but indirectly would do

anyways….that is a rather rambling thread, and i dont want people to think this is a complaing thread because it isnt, i am just wanting other people opinions on this

The problem with new cards for When-Revealed cancelation is that if it is better (or less costly) than A Test of Will, people will call out power creep and complain how you need to buy newest adventure packs to stay in game (which should be true since it is LCG, but that another topic), if it is not as good as (or more costly) than A Test of Will, people will (once again) point out how there isn't 3 copies of A Test of Will in the Core Set and reflame the old arguement.

The cost to cancel trechery must equal to a card and a spirit resource, or a hero exhausion.

Also the fact there are so many shadow cancellation out there now restricts options for When-Revealed cancellation.
If we were to see a 3 Cost Leadership ally that has ability to discard itself to cancel when-revealed effect, that's being generic and not creative at all. So there is need to spice things a bit. (change sphere? cost? extra restriction? additional ability? I don't know)

But from what I've seen in the Hobbit expansions and HoN delux expansion, I have every faith Caleb will do an excellent job (unless he already did excellent job and our new when-revealed cancellation cards are printing as we type)
