Let's say Gloin has Steward of Gondor attached, giving him the Gondor trait. He also has a Song of Battle attached to give him access to the Tactics sphere.

 

If he takes a damage, and gains a resource, then plays Gondorian Discipline (GD) to cancel the damage, does he have to give up the resource he gained? My guess would be yes.

 

Now let's complicate it a bit. Gloin is initially at 0 resources. There is also a copy of Heavy Curse in play, and a copy of GD in the discard pile, making GD cost 1 to play.

 

Now when Gloin suffers a damage and takes a resource, he uses that resource to play GD. What happens to the damage? What happens to the resource?

Did you already pose this question to Caleb Seastan? I'm very curious to see how far he wants to take this time rewinding nonsense.

I don't actually think it is time-rewinding anymore (in the case of Gloin / Gondorian Discipline).  I'm fairly confident we've been told that "just revealed" effects occur before "after revealed" effects.  This wording seems identical in the case of Gondorian Discipline and Gloin meaning that you MUST trigger Gondorian Discipline first, and if you choose not to and then subsequently choose to trigger Gloin's response then you've officially closed the window in which you could have triggered Gondorian Discipline so gaining the resource from Gloin's response would not allow you to play the Gondorian Discipline (in Seastan's example).

 

The reason I say we've been told that "just" occurs before "after" is because I'm fairly certain this is true of A Test of Will (just revealed) and any of the various effects that trigger "after revealed".

No - this scenario is just so cooked up that it would likely never happen, and I don't think Caleb bothers responding to such questions. I need to think of a more common situation where it could occur.
