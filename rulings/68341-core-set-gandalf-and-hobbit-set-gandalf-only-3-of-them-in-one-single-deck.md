Hello everyone,

I wondered if we could be able to play more than three gandalfs per deck since a new one is coming next month.

Here is the official answer from FFG :

> Hi Emrad,

> You can only have 3 copies of any card by title in your deck. Since both Gandalf cards have the same title you cannot include more than a total of 3 in your deck. However, you can mix-and-match if you want to play with 1 "old" and 2 "new" or vice versa.Â

I expected this, but a little part of me still wanted to believe it could have been possible to play more than 3 Gandalfs ^^
