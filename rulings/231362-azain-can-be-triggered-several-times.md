For a moment i thought not:

But someone said that Earendil is triggered several times for multiple players:

What you think?

> I wonder though... If you attack an indestructible target and deal more damage than it has hit points, can Firefoot still redirect the excess damage and kill a different enemy?

 

Since Firefoot requires a non-unique enemy, and all enemies with Indestructible are also unique, it's a moot point. But if there ever was an indestructible non-unique, I think that this BGG thread [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/846630/indestructible] would become relevant. In it, the question came up of whether you can place excess damage beyond Durin's Bane's total HP (since he's indestructible). And the response from Caleb Grace was "You can place more than 27 damage on Durin's Bane."

 

Therefore, I conclude that when you're attacking an indestructible target, there is no such thing as "excess" damage. "Excess" damage is the damage tokens you have left to place when the enemy is destroyed. So even if FFG ever releases a non-unique indestructible enemy, Firefoot will not be able to trigger off attacks against that enemy.

> Just to add: If Firefoot said something different, like "Exhaust Firefoot to deal X damage to that enemy, where X is the amount of excess damage dealt by this attack" then I'd agree. But it doesn't say that. You are actually assigning the damage from the attack directly to a different enemy. 

I suspected this was not the case (that you are assigning damage from the attack) and that it was firefoot that is doing the damage and the source of the second enemy being damaged so I sent in a rules question:

 

"Hi Caleb Lets say I have the ally Azain Silverbeard in play with Sword-thain and Firefoot attached. He attacks an enemy and destroys it, the excess damage from firefoot then destroys a second enemy. Was that second enemy destroyed by the effect on firefoot or because of the way it is worded is this enemy considered to be destroyed by Azain's attack as well? Would you for example be able to use Foe-hammer using the enemy destroyed by the spillover damage as the target? (let say Azain has a weapon attachment as well). Many Thanks in advance"

"Hi Psychorocka,

The second enemy in that situation was destroyed by Firefoot’s effect. Only the enemy that Azain attacks is considered to be destroyed by Azain.

Cheers,

Caleb"

So the second enemy being destroyed in the original hypothetical situation of Azain with Firefoot trying to use his ability twice is not destroyed by Azain let alone the attack but is destroyed by Firefoot itself.
