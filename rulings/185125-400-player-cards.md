As of Escape from Mount Gram.  This does not include heroes, or treasures or boons from the saga campaigns.  Also, I don't have Land of Shadow yet so I haven't included those cards.

 

400 cards may sound like a lot, but a typical rotating card pool will often contain 2000 cards so this really just highlights how slowly our card pool grows.

Caleb said there won't be an only player card product, sadly. I feel 500 is awfully low for a game that's benn going for 5 or so years.

Did Caleb put any insight into it? Like, why there won't be any?
