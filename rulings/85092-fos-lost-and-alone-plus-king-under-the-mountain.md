# [FoS: Lost and Alone plus King Under the Mountain](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85092-fos-lost-and-alone-plus-king-under-the-mountain/)

If a hero is in your deck and you use King Under the Mountain and end up revealing that hero, can you put the card into play?  Here's relevant card, manual, and FAQ text with emphasis added:
 
FAQ:
When Lost and Alone comes out, 
 
Q: How does the card Lost and Alone (DD 124) work? What if the hero gets attached to a Nameless Thing (DD 125) or was my last hero in play?
 
A: You only put the lost hero back into play if you draw the hero, whether during the resource phase or through a card effect. If the hero is discarded or attached to a card like a Nameless Thing, then treat it like any other card. In the latter situation, the value of the hero would be null, since it has no printed cost. If your last hero gets shuffled into your deck you are not eliminated from the game; heroes are not considered to be killed unless they are in your discard pile. You will continue playing until you either draw the hero, are eliminated through other means, or the game ends. 
 
King Under the Mountain:
Action: Exhaust King Under the Mountain to look at the top 2 cards of your deck. Add 1 to your hand and discard the other.
 
Manual pg. 20:
When resolving effects that move cards from a player’s discard pile to his hand or deck, hero cards in the discard pile are ignored, as hero cards cannot move to a player’s hand or deck.
 
Lost and Alone:
When Revealed: Each player chooses and shuffles a hero he controls into his deck. When he draws that hero, he puts it into play.
----------------------
 
 
My current thinking is that "add" and "draw" are accepted to be different mechanisms.  A card like Enchanted Stream prevents card draw, but you can still get cards into your hand by using King Under the Mountain or other cards that use the text "add" instead of "draw."  I think that's a commonly understood distinction, but I can't find anything official to back it up.  Is there an official source indicating a distinction between "draw" and "add" when dealing with player cards?
 
That said, hero cards can't be added to your hand.  And as King Under the Mountain does not "draw" the hero, you wouldn't be able to put that hero into play, per the text on Lost and Alone.  Thus your only option is to discard the hero and add the other card to your hand.  What do others think?

And what happens if you use King Under the Mountain and end up revealing TWO heroes?  Will the game spontaneously combust?  Is this like crossing the streams?

I decided to go ahead and ask Caleb Grace, since I thought this was a very good question, and here's the answer:

"I believe the spirit of the effect is that when you are able to take your hero into your hand from your deck, then you get to put it back into play. Therefore, I would rule that if you took your hero into hand via use of King Under the Mountain, you should be able to put it into play.
However, if you had two heroes in your deck and found both of them with the same use of King Under the Mountain, then you'd have to choose one to put into play and the other to be discarded.
I'm afraid those are the kinds of hard decisions that a king of dwarves must make…
Cheers,
Caleb"

So there you have it. I guess the "add" phrase didn't matter in this case.

On a side note, it seems there is an actual distinction between "draw" and "add".

I was asking Caleb earlier on a similar situation before reading this thread, and just got his answer:

 

Can I still use King Under the Mountain's action while Enchanted Stream is the active location, considering King Under the Mountain uses the wording "add 1 to your hand" rather than "draw 1 card" ?

 

> Yes. You are not "drawing" a card with King Under the Mountain, so the text on Enchanted Stream does not prevent you from adding that card to your hand.

The problem is "at that time" in Caleb answer. One could interpret it as : if your last hero get lost, you lose. But if one get lost and one die, you might be still alive.

I think that if your last hero die, even if the other is lost, you've lost.

So either way, the only possibility to have no more hero without dying is only by Desesperate Alliance.
