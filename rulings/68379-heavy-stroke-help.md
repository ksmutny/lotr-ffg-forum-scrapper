Can some one help me out here?

"Heavy Stroke

Response: After a Dwarf deals X damage to an enemy during combat, deal and additional X damage to that enemy. (Limit once per phase.) "

How the heck would I know exactly how much damage came from the Dwarf if multiple characters are attacking?
Can I choose freely up to the Dwarf's Attack-limit?

Official Ruling has come down…

Booored:

                    With Heavy Stroke.. did the card mean to say "an attack that a dwarf participates in" or dose it mean the
                    dmg the target dwarf makes IN an attack. Like if you have Aragorn and Dwalin attacking a 1 Defence
                    Monster with 5 Health….

                    Is it…
                   Arragon (3) + Dwalin (2) = 5 -1(Defence ) = 4 dmg + Heavy Stroke (double dmg) = 8 dmg Total

                   Or is it..
                   Aragorn (3) + Dwalin (2) = 5-1 Defence = 4 dmg + Heavy Stroke (Dwalin 2 -1 = 1 dmg doubled (2) )
                  = 6 Dmg total?

                   Thanks in advance

Hi Booored,
The way Heavy Stroke is intended to work depends on allowing players to choose which character's attack value is applied to the enemy's defense value. In your example, the optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply Aragorn's attack 3 to the enemy's 1 defense. So Aragorn is dealing 2 damage to the enemy and Dwalin is also dealing 2 damage, at which point you play Heavy Stroke to double Dwalin's damage and make it 4 for a total of 6 damage dealt to the enemy.

Just to clarify it further, let's say Aragorn and Dwalin were attacking an enemy with 4 defense. The optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply all 3 of Aragron's attack plus 1 of Dwalin's to beating the enemy's defensse, then Dwalin would deal 1 damage to the enemy that could be double with Heavy Stroke for a total of 2.

Hope that helps,
