Hi guys,

1. While The Balrog is in the staging area the only way to attack him is if I have characters that can perform ranged attacks, am I right?

2. During the combat phase, can The Balrog attack me while he is in the staging area?, if so, do I need to deal a shadow card on him?

3. Regarding to the Forced effects on the Doom, Doom, Doom card, I would think the those effects can be resolved in any order, if so, if the second forced effect is resolved first The Balrog shouldn't attack the first round he enters in the game, am I right?

Thank you for your help!

Of course, but you have to start with the one that changes the game state first. In this case it's the first forced effect.

Plus I also found this statement from Caleb back in 2014 regarding Doom, doom, doom. He took a different stance but with the same outcome as I mentioned above.

"Encounter card effects should always be resolved in reading order - from top to bottom. Therefore, you must resolve the first Forced effect on Doom, Doom, Doom (if able) before resolving the 2nd Forced effect. That means that the Balrog will make an attack during the quest phase that it is added to the staging area.
I hope youâ€™re enjoying The Road Darkens!"
Cheers,
Caleb
