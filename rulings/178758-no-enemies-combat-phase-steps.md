So I know I've been asking a bunch of weird questions lately, but hopefully I can get some insight on this one. Do the steps of the combat phase still happen in the same order if there are no enemies engaged with a player? I only ask because I'm playing through some of the Dwarrowdelf quests where you have the Cave Torch, and I'm wondering if I can activate it in the action window that occurs after enemies have all attacked, but before my characters have. Any thoughts?

What about Westfold Outrider then? I remember in the article he was spoiled in it talking about "using him after the enemies have attacked to engage an enemy and kill it with Eomer" or something. Does that mean enemies had to have attacked for you to engage a completely different enemy? I guess I can see what you're saying though, those windows would only be available if enemies were there. I dunno. I sent a question to Caleb, we shall see.

I dug up that article [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/11/8/ride-headlong-against-the-enemy/] and it says this about the Westfold Outrider:

 

"At first glance, players might wonder: why would I want to discard an ally to engage an enemy? But when you consider that you can trigger this action during the combat phase, after enemies have attacked, then it becomes a useful way to trigger Éomer’s attack boost and destroy that enemy. Or, you can trigger the Westfold Outrider’s ability during the quest phase to engage an enemy and remove its threat strength from the staging area, making it easier to quest successfully and place progress on the quest"

 

Not sure, honestly-- Caleb could have been thinking about a situation in which you are engaged with an enemy.  In that case, you can use the Outrider after you've declared an attack against another enemy (so you're clearly past the 'enemies attack' portion of the combat phase), and then you get around the additional enemy's attack without any trouble.

 

But still not sure: is there a 'general' action window between 'deal shadow cards' and 'end of combat phase?'  Or are any action windows granted as a result of the attack/defense resolution process?

 

I hate this timing stuff...

Rules Question:
> Hi! So I was playing Nightmare Foundations of Stone tonight and was wondering if an action I took was legal or not. If you aren't engaged with any enemies, does the combat phase still progress through the normal steps and actions windows that it would if you were engaged with enemies? My thought was: I would activate Cave Torch during the combat phase in the action window after all enemies have attacked. If an enemy popped up, Haldir would be able to kill it. Was this legal? Does the combat phase progress normally even without enemies attacking? Thank you, hope to hear your thoughts!

 

Hi Chris,

Clever solution. If there are no enemies in play, there is still a combat phase. As such, you could declare the “Resolving Enemy Attacks” portion complete after no enemies attack, and then use the Cave Torch during the “Attacking Enemies” portion of the phase.
Well done!
Cheers,
Caleb

 

Incase anyone was left wondering what the official ruling on the combat phase action window thing was. =)

But what about when an enemy engages the next player and makes an attack? The fact that the first player already did his "resolve attacks step" doesn't mean that doesn't occur. Wouldn't this be a similar situation? An enemy with an attack to make engages a new player? Either way, I sent a question to Caleb. I gotta figure out this two player stuff... lol.

If the first player finishes defending against the enemies engaged with him and then uses Westfold Outrider to engage one of the second players enemies, that enemy still attacks, correct? The fact that it's still the "resolve enemy attacks" step takes precedence over the fact that the first player was done with his portion of the step?

 

Hi Chris,

Westfold Outrider’s ability can be used to prevent an enemy from attacking if used correctly. After the first player resolves each of his engaged enemy’s attacks and play passes to the next player, the first player can then discard a Westfold Outrider to engage an enemy engaged with another player. That enemy will not attack because the first player has already resolved his enemies attacks and the game has advanced to the next player’s attacks.
Cheers,
Caleb

 

Did not expect that one! Westfold Outrider just got a whole lot better for me, lol.

I think you should ask Caleb again because it's not clear in which action window the first player discards the outrider here :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
