I honestly didn't realize it was this bad.  Since Wilds was announced, Arkham finished one cycle, started and finished a second, and announced a third.  I know you have been saying this, but I wanted to look at real data.  And... it's worse than I thought.

To be clear, I'm absolutely not blaming any of the game designers. I totally appreciate Caleb and Matt's dedication to our hobby.   This kind of thing is a decision made higher up.  And yeah, I feel like the loyalty of the LOTR community is being taken advantage of.

I'm buying both games. The hype is Arkham. It gets more releases.

LOTR LCG is still a very lively 7-years old game.

We already know there's more to come (Gildor Inglorion) which probably means one cycle. Caleb also hinted at some campaign mode things for LOTR LCG, though that's much more tentative.

Releases are slower but steady.

So I'm just asking: what's the issue?

I'd rather vent my hate and rant at the digital thingy thing which should have its own forums and news tags on FFG's website. The digital confusion, I think, would harm the physical game much more than Arkham LCG does.

Caleb was asked if Gildor and Stonehelm were going to be released outside of the CE and he said, “I honestly don’t know.”

It's frustrating that the game is a second class citizen (as it seems) but at the same time Arkham is new and the cult of the new is kind of a thing in the board gaming community. I am sure FFG knows that people are buying and enjoying LOTR LCG. What worries me more however is that they only have Caleb working on the game. Don't know how development works on these things, but I would assume there should be more people on board. 

EDIT: Also, I feel like the Arkham LCG craze will tone down way faster than LOTR LCG did. FFG has overdone it with the Lovecraft theme. There are literally so many games from them with that theme and they are releasing the 3rd edition of the board game soon which I am sure will be the main focus for many players for this universe. LOTR LCG is unique on the other hand. There is no other LOTR themed game of that scale. I considered for a second to get into the Arkham LCG but then thought to myself that Elder Sign covers me (although a different type of game). Plus my friend has the board game so we are covered there as well. How much more Lovecraft theme can someone digest.

That's disturbing.  The article said "These heroes will eventually enter The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game through standard products," which I assumed meant a future AP/Deluxe (I suppose if they ever made the starter kit a regular product -- which would make sense as an entry point -- then it would become a standard product).  In fact, I figured Stonehelm was coming this cycle since we're right in his neighborhood.  If he's *not* from this cycle than there's still hope for an Eagles hero after all.

Caleb was gave that answer for the quests themselves. I remember seeing that FB post. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Still a bummer that the quests are locked behind a CE though...

Looking at the delay (comparatively) recently, as it looks like we are in an every other month schedule. I was wondering if it is possible they are intentionally spreading the releases out, keeping them steady, but less frequent,in order to keep Caleb able to work on the digital, or to meet some other unknown deadline, like they have something else in the works for the game...

I was under the impression that Caleb was no longer working on the digital game and was now back to work full time on the LCG. If he is still working on the digital game, the situaton is indeed worse than I thought,

Personally, I just hope we can get to explore what is left of the lore before the game ends :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] You know what I mean, more Istari heroes, palantiri, artifacts, etc.
