The Nightmare instruction for Return to Mirkwood reads:

 

Forced: At the beginning of the quest phase, the player who is guarding Gollum must either exhaust a hero he controls or resolve the "when revealed" effect of the topmost Tantrum card in the encounter discard pile. 

 

According to the latest FAQ, when a card reads "must either" the player can choose between either of the forced effects, though he must completely fulfill the effect (the key word here is "either" in contrast with the ruling above it in the FAQ).

 

My question is: If there are no Tantrum cards in the discard pile, can I still choose the second effect and therefore avoid exhausting a hero and resolving a Tantrum card? That is the way I have been playing it. Otherwise, exhausting a hero is really nasty at the beginning of the quest and makes this nightmare even more "nighmare-ish". Just wanted to follow the ruling on this one, since the FAQ addresses it.

> Looking at the FAQ (1.44), you have to do one in full, so if you can't reveal a tantrum card you have to exhaust a hero. Harder for the player, as usual. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Look at this post however...

Followed By Night must be an exception then.... (or was created when this game was young and was worded badly) as in almost all other cases I've seen rulings in both the FAQ/Rules and people that have asked Caleb come back with: that one option must be fully resolved and able to occur or you must choose the other.

I think you're right, the "must either" and "must or" are direct results from people being able to take cards where you make a choice and have them do nothing. Having to choose an effect that fully triggers if possible gives those treacheries or whatever card it may be a little more bite. So we can still see what FFG says when they get back to me, but I think that cards like Followed by Night you can choose an effect that may effectively have no impact, as it is an older card. At least that's the way I'm reading it. We shall see. =)

Yup much more thematic as well. You must guard gollum with a hero every turn or face one of his nasty tantrums!

Plus imagine for 3 or 4 turns that no tantrums did show up and there were still none in the discard pile... that would mean for the first 3 or 4 turns you would not have to exhaust a hero OR resolve a tantrum... far too easy for nightmare.
