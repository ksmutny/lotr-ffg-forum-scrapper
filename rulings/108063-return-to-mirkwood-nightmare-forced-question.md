# [Return to Mirkwood Nightmare Forced Question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/)

The Nightmare instruction for Return to Mirkwood reads:

 

Forced: At the beginning of the quest phase, the player who is guarding Gollum must either exhaust a hero he controls or resolve the "when revealed" effect of the topmost Tantrum card in the encounter discard pile. 

 

According to the latest FAQ, when a card reads "must either" the player can choose between either of the forced effects, though he must completely fulfill the effect (the key word here is "either" in contrast with the ruling above it in the FAQ).

 

My question is: If there are no Tantrum cards in the discard pile, can I still choose the second effect and therefore avoid exhausting a hero and resolving a Tantrum card? That is the way I have been playing it. Otherwise, exhausting a hero is really nasty at the beginning of the quest and makes this nightmare even more "nighmare-ish". Just wanted to follow the ruling on this one, since the FAQ addresses it.

> Looking at the FAQ (1.44), you have to do one in full, so if you can't reveal a tantrum card you have to exhaust a hero. Harder for the player, as usual. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Look at this post however...

Followed By Night must be an exception then.... (or was created when this game was young and was worded badly) as in almost all other cases I've seen rulings in both the FAQ/Rules and people that have asked Caleb come back with: that one option must be fully resolved and able to occur or you must choose the other.

I think you're right, the "must either" and "must or" are direct results from people being able to take cards where you make a choice and have them do nothing. Having to choose an effect that fully triggers if possible gives those treacheries or whatever card it may be a little more bite. So we can still see what FFG says when they get back to me, but I think that cards like Followed by Night you can choose an effect that may effectively have no impact, as it is an older card. At least that's the way I'm reading it. We shall see. =)

Yup much more thematic as well. You must guard gollum with a hero every turn or face one of his nasty tantrums!

Plus imagine for 3 or 4 turns that no tantrums did show up and there were still none in the discard pile... that would mean for the first 3 or 4 turns you would not have to exhaust a hero OR resolve a tantrum... far too easy for nightmare.

Official answer. Followed by Night is a special exception, as are cards targeting "all" of something. In that case, "all" could be 0. Otherwise, you have to choose an effect that you can resolve if possible. 

 

When resolving any When Revealed effect that gives you a choice between two effects, you must choose an effect that you can fully resolve. Followed by Night is an odd example because you can always resolve either effect. That’s because it targets either ‘all allies’ or ‘all enemies’ and the word ‘all’ can include 0.
Good question. Please don’t hesitate to write again if you have more.
Cheers,
Caleb

> right... cause me being completely correct and you being completely wrong had nothing going for it. Sour grapes much? Just suck it up man! hehe

lol wut. Dude I don't even understand what your trying to say. sour grapes? your the one who is completely wrong AND the one having a whinge and trying to make up some nonsense about wah wah people ask for help but then don't accept my completely wrong answer and instead ask Caleb who is the lead designer, how dare they! when really your just upset that you were completely wrong. You are too funny.

 

Also your the one who made it nasty first and said I needed to go and re read the rulebook and then complained about people asking questions on the forums and not just blindly trusting answers from you. Don't try to act too cool now, you were rude, insulting and then completely wrong. I wouldn't have even said anything at all had you not had a whinge about your advice not being followed and your "wasted breath".

Helping those new to the game is not a waste of breath even if they have to ask the developers in the end.

Well...

This thread got an official response that enlight us on another shrouded rule, and will make us better understand the mechanics of this game.

And I start to re read only Booored post on this thread, and he come up completly right.

It appears to me that you are only bashing him because he may appear lofty, but you two answering him in complete nonsense (since, you know, he IS right, the answer he gave totally match with Caleb answer ON THIS POINT) and you are as disrespectfull as you say he is.

Then, Booored being right on this point appear to be only a fluke as he is right only when the wording include "all", wich can "fizzle" but we now know that if there is a future case that doesn't include "all", he might not have been right. Booored give short and correct answer to question ask by begginer (at least, as far as I remember). We can agree he lake in explanation when it comes to debating rules and bragging about unescessary official answer is too much. But see how you treat him too. If I am to say who is giving bad vibes to this forum, I would not separate Chris51261 and PsychoRocka from Booored.

The original question was about return to mirkwood nightmare not the card followed by night.

Reread the ruling dude, he was wrong.

The ruling from Cale

it amazes me pebbels can still not see what is going on here. It is kind of unbelievable.

 

 

> if the card has multiple options to choose from, you can choose either option.. even if that option fizzles and can not resolve. 
> 
>  

 

This is exactly what Caleb said. Should I have taken more time to spoon feed it to everyone.. I guess so. I just expected more I guess. Next time I'll make very detailed posts so even fools can work it out.

> This is obviously some bizarro post where saying the opposite of the ruling means you're totally right, so I'm out. Sorry to "disrespect" booored, who is always so considerate of others.

this thread is making my head hurt - haha. total bizarro world!

 

you cannot choose an effect that fizzles if the card says "must," according to Caleb. it's as plain as day. you must choose something that affects the game state (i.e. is able to "fully resolve").

## 12 [booored on June 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/?do=findComment&comment=1117508)

OMG... you boys must be trolling.. no one can be this wrong without doing it on purpose. 

 

The point is that these card fizzle. The "all" keyword triggers even on zero cards. It is like a blanket effects that targets all and not individual cards. So the card effect triggers but it fizzles.. that is what fizzles means in card game terms in case you missed the last 30 years of gaming.. fizzles does not mean .. "does / can not resolve".. it means " it resolves but has no effect".

 

When resolving any When Revealed effect that gives you a choice between two effects, you must choose an effect that you can fully resolve. Followed by Night is an odd example because you can always resolve either effect. That’s because it targets either ‘all allies’ or ‘all enemies’ and the word ‘all’ can include 0.Good question. Please don’t hesitate to write again if you have more.

 

Cheers,

Caleb
 

So.. this is exactly what I said.. if the effects fizzles.. then you can pick either, as both ALWAYS RESOLVE. Regardless of if there is an effect during that resolution.
