# [Do new enemies engaging during combat also attack?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93529-do-new-enemies-engaging-during-combat-also-attack/)

I'm in combat phase and have dealt shadow cards to engaged enemies. When one attacks, it triggers a new enemy from the staging area to engage me. Does that enemy also get to attack me? If so, does it get a shadow card dealt to it?

 

I assume it attacks, but doesn't get a shadow card, but I'm not sure about either.

after about 2.5 years of playing this game i still have not found a certain answer for the frodo/muck adder scenario and similar.

has anyone got an answer from caleb or nate that clarifies this? i have probably asked twice on different threads throughout the game's life

As for Frodo taking damage via Muck Adder, the official answer concurs with alogos, given the link I found below, where Caleb wrote: "In order for the Adder's ability to destroy a character to trigger, damage must actually be placed. If you use Frodo's ability to raise threat instead of taking damage from a Muck Adder, then the Adder has not actually damaged Frodo and it's ability will not trigger."

Therefore, we can also assume Harbor Thug doesn't take the scroll.

 

As to my original question, the consensus is Harbor Thug attacks. But does he get a shadow card?

To any still interested, I wrote Caleb and he replied...

 

If an enemy engages you during the "resolving enemy attacks" portion of the combat phase, it will make an attack. However, it will not be dealt a shadow card since it was not engaged with you at the beginning of the combat phase when shadow cards were dealt.
