I'm really not so sure that im liking the cards in this new pack.  Don't get me wrong, they are very good but that's the thing that I dont like about them.  It's changing the game so much.  People are saying that they are getting amazing scores and stuff with the outlands decks.  I'm not so fond of having a deck thats just all high stat characters.  I hope they dont make this type of deck any better than it is as it seems it is one of the most powerfull decks so far.  Of course if I dont like the outlands deck so much than I dont have to play it but I just hope In this cycle that all the other decks dont start to turn usless and forgoten.  It seems now that we are getting more and more powerfull cards and the quests are also getting more and more harder.  This leaves all the other quests so easy that they just arnt even worth playing.  

Umm what are your thoughts??

I saw this as FFG trying to create a new "jumping on" point for new players - Core, Heirs and Stewards Fear now let you build a pretty strong deck without going back and getting mirkwood/dwarrodelf and the duluxe/saga expansions. This lets new players get into the game with a decent deck without too much initial outlay.

 



 

 

I think this hits the nail on the head. A lot of new players were turned off by the fact that they can't easily pick up the core set and HofN and be effective. Now with this first AP a new player gets a highly effective deck in just one box and should be able to play through the rest of the AP cycle without having to buy AP's that are two years old (and in many cases out of print!)

 

I think it's a smart move from FFG to address one of the big problems people have with this game. I suspect that in future AP's we won't see the kind of mono-theme like we saw from Steward's Fear. They've done that and can now return to fleshing out gondor and monosphere decks.

 

With regards to the quest itself, I'm really enjoying it. I like that it's highly replayable and the synthesis of mechanics, story and flavor is excellent. People are comparing this Emyn Muil but it's sooooo much better than that random wander through the mountains. I really love the direction that FFG is taking this game in terms of building a story, almost like a card based RPG. Keep up the good work Caleb and FFG!
