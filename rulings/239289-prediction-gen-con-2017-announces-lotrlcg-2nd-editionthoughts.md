Curious, Does anybody else strongly suspect that LOTR:LCG 2nd edition is right around the corner? Here is my reasoning:
 
1. Rings is the the last original LCG still standing after Thrones 1st ed. went down a couple years ago.
 
2. The last LOTR source material saga box is supposedly going to be announced at any time (I"m a little surprised at how long the announcement is taking).
 
3. The size of the card pool and scenario difficulty curve have reached a point where it has gotten very difficult for new players to jump in and play the latest expansions.
 
4. Even the condensed FAQ is like 20 pages long at this point.
 
5. They've been fairly quiet for a while now, not withstanding the release of Sands of Harad... as if they are working on something big?
 
My Prediction: Gen Con 2017 announces LOTR:LCG 2nd edition!

I for one would welcome it. There are a lot of substandard card designs (*cough, cough... Steward of Gondor...cough*) and clunky mechanics (*4 players, 1 active location anyone?,) that could be learned from and perfected in a second edition. LOTR:LCG was an experiment that succeeded greatly, and we can already see some lessons learned applied to the design of the new Lovecraft LCG. They've had a chance to experiment with A LOT of game mechanics that could be incorporated into the base game or set up for similar scenario mechanics with more finesse. I also look at how much better designed and more thematic just about every nightmare deck is over it's early cycle predecessors.

Discuss

> Nate is still working on AGoT, are we (meaning Gunslinger) sure that Matt is ONLY doing AH?

 

We know that Matt is only working on Nightmare packs for LOTR now. Normal cycles are Caleb's only. But he also said that he and Caleb work side by side in the office, so they informally work together at times.

Caleb mentioned at Gen Con when someone asked that he doesn't see a need for any kind of second edition. Because it's not a competitive game, there's really no need, and it would also cramp the game's design space, after so much effort was already put into the original design. What would they do... Go back and start at Mirkwood all over again? Design a second-best test of will or steward of Gondor? That sounds like a wasted opportunity and not the best marketing pitch.

I hope they never do a second edition, but that they just keep going. Harad is a good place for newer players to jump in. A large reason why I stopped playing Decipher's LOTR TCG after a number of years was because they basically created a second edition that required new cards and substantial new investment to stay competitive. Again, since this isn't a competitive game, I don't think they'd have the marketing power to pull it off, even if they wanted to do it.

My impression of the last two cycles is that they are designing each cycle to be played in a satisfying way with the core set and that cycle only, instead of relying of all the previous card pool. In this way you don't have to buy the whole huge amount of expansions to be "competitive".
