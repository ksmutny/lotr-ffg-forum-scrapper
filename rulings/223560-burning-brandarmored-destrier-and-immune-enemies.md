Hey guys, was just wondering if cards like Burning Brand and Armored Destrier work against enemies with the "Immune to player card effects." While these cards do kind of sound like they're targeting the shadow cards themselves, part of me was having doubts during our last game. Thanks!

I've just received answer from Caleb and it seems that the struggle with one of these most terrifying enemies can be eased a little, at least when we talk about immune shadow cards dealt to it:

 

The effect of Tides of Fate event card CAN be used during the Balrog's attack in Journey in the Dark scenario.
Here is my question and Caleb's answer:

Hello Caleb :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] just one quick question regarding Tides of Fate event card: would it be legal to play it during the Balrog's attack in the Journey in the Dark scenario, when a shadow effect of Many-pillared Hall increases Balrog's attack? One can say that ToF's effect does not target shadow card directly, but it targets defending character...
ToF effect: Response: When a shadow card increases an enemy's Attack by any amount, increase the defending character's Defense by 3 for that attack. Then, the players as a group may spend 2 Tactics resources to ready the defending character and give it +3 Attack for its next attack this phase.
The Balrog's text: (...) The Balrog and shadow cards dealt to The Balrog are immune to player card effects. (...)
And Many-pillared Hall's shadow effect: Shadow: Attacking enemy gets +1 Attack (+2 Attack instead if the defending player's threat is 35 or higher). Thanks in advance, cheers, Michal
A: Hi Michal, You can play Tides of Fate in the situation you describe because Tides of Fate doesn’t impact the Balrog or it’s shadow effect. Cheers, Caleb
