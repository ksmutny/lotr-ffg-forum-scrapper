I've mostly been playing spirit. I ventured into spirit lore and that felt good. 


Now I wish to tread into darker waters - tactics and leadership perhaps. I figure with Gloin getting rich being a blocker, I can devote the other 2 hero slots to tactics to swaddle the dwarf in bubble wrap so he can keep taking punishment. 


 


I haven't played tactics or leadership before - is it sufficient to have 1 hero with leadership resource in such a situation? Do leadership cards cost oodles?

Intuitively, I've always thought songs etc grant resource icons but that doesn't change a hero's sphere. Gloin is a Leadership character, even with a Song of Wisdom attached. Each sphere has its own way of countering shadow effects, and making A Burning Brand available to non-lore characters would make it way too powerful in my opinion. But I haven't seen a ruling on this - maybe Caleb reasons differently.

You can indeed attach Burning Brand to any hero as long as he has Song of Wisdom. Iirc Heirs of Númenor was the first time we were introduced to the concept of "with the printed [sphere] icon", which specifically prohibits this kind of play.

I do believe it is in the FAQ somewhere but can´t be bothered to find it :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
