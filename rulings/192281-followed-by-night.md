When Revealed: The first player (choose 1): deals 1 damage to all allies in play and Followed by Night gains surge, or all enemies engaged with players make an immediate attack, if able.

 

Can you "choose" to do something that can not happen, if there is an option that can happen?

 

You have some 1 health allies in play, but have no engaged monsters... could you still choose option 2?

You can choose either one in this case, because if there are 0 enemies engaged with players, "all" of them can make an attack, or if there are 0 allies in play, "all" of them can take 1 damage.

 

Here's a specific quote from Caleb (designer) about Followed By Night:

 

"When resolving any When Revealed effect that gives you a choice between two effects, you must choose an effect that you can fully resolve. Followed by Night is an odd example because you can always resolve either effect. That’s because it targets either ‘all allies’ or ‘all enemies’ and the word ‘all’ can include 0."

 

That's from this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126831-quick-question-followed-by-night/].  So to recap: when choosing an effect, you have to do one that can be FULLY resolved.  But because of how Followed by Night is worded, you are always able to FULLY resolve either effect.
