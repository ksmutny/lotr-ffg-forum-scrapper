Hey all,

I was thinking today about how some contracts force some common cards to be seen across various decks. I wanted to compile a list of the most common cards ("locks") for a deck running a particular contract. Some are a little more difficult than others, so I wanted the community's input.

1. Fellowship

Lock: A Very Good Tale

Honorable Mention: Elrond

Right out the gate, I am struggling a bit on this one. A good chunk of Fellowship decks use A Very Good Tale as a way to accelerate the allies into play, and for good reason -- there are a good chunk of expensive unique allies, such that if you can get a couple in early, this singular card could shorten your time on side A by a full turn or two. However, this requires running a deck with at least one leadership hero, so it does limit the style (A Caldara deck probably wouldn't run this card). Due to the variety of strategies involved in getting allies into play, this one is somewhat difficult to figure out. However, Elrond does lend itself to paying for allies outside of sphere PLUS his ring can accelerate the process even further. 

2. Burglar's Turn

Lock: Haldan

Honorable Mention: Citadel Plate

Alright, maybe some controversy with this one, but Haldan seems to be, at the very least, wasting space in your storage if you are running a Burglar's Turn deck without him. He sits for the entire game (minus the first turn) committed to the quest without exhausting, has in-sphere location control, and a built in card draw. Even if you are not running him in the deck that's running the contract, it seems silly to leave him out of any multiplayer fellowship. His stat line is excellent, and with the toys you get out of the loot deck, you can make him a very powerful force. Now, I struggled a bit with the Honorable mention. There are plenty of guarded cards that ought to be included, and perhaps I could have left it with "all guarded cards" as that will most likely be the case to get to 14 item/artifact attachments. However, the other benefit (besides ignoring guarded keyword, no small issue) of the loot deck is the fact that it doesn't have to be in-sphere nor do you have to pay the cost. Since the Citadel Plate is a great benefit offset by the cost of the card, I think this ought to be in any loot deck. In low combat scenarios, perhaps the guarded weapons are traded out for willpower items, and vice versa for high combat scenarios. Maybe I am wrong on this, but since Citadel Plate is not restricted to any trait specific hero, even someone like Galadriel can sit as a soaker with just this card.

3. Forth! The Three Hunters

Lock: The One Ring

Honorable Mention: Dagger of Westerneese

No question here. Unless you are running 3 extremely high threat heroes, most of us are willing to trade the elimination drop to gain the restricted attachment out the gate, with your choice of some excellent neutral events or some case-specific attachments in your starting hand. Since you need 6 restricted attachments to flip to the willpower/healing boost (unless you are, for some reason, running less than 3 heroes), getting 16% of your work done out the gate helps tremendously. As for the Dagger, so many restricted attachments require some trait or sphere. This card comes in free on side A and is marginally better than round shield.  An argument could be made of a hunters deck that is not running tactics would not be running this card, in which case I request to see how a non-tactics deck runs enough restricted attachments and still stays combat viable. In a fellowship, sure, I've seen it (I myself have run a Glorfindel-Slegolas-Limli build) but boy it takes a while to get that engine up and running, doesn't it?

4. The Grey Wanderer

Lock: Strider

Honorable Mention: Timely Aid

The combo that started the thought process to begin with. This card becomes such a lock with this contract, I feel like ringsdb has become a mad dash to see who can build a viable deck that doesn't fetch this card in setup (to little avail, in my opinion -- we all have to quest). This contract could have opened up all kinds of neat combos if they allowed one sneak through of a guarded card, but alas, the powers that be force us into this option nearly every time. With that in mind, and such starved for characters to help balance the load, Timely Aid becomes the card you mulligan for to try and get in some powerful beasts while in secrecy.  Need I say more?

5. Council of the Wise

Lock: Daeron's Runes

Honorable Mention: Heed the Dream

So this is a difficult one. You would like to have plenty of events to run in your deck, but a singular card may not show up the entire game. With that in mind, I think it's safe to say if you are running a lore hero (access to card draw will be key to any semblance of consistency) then Daeron's Runes is your go-to auto include. Coming up with 50 individual cards with a little synergy is difficult enough, so deck thinning is practically required. Daeron's Runes does more than thin your deck -- it gives you cards, choices, and a trigger for the contract. Best of all, it's free, so you don't even need to do the "burn a resource to gain a resource" trick with the contract. This is slightly different than Heed the Dream, another great card in it's own right. I give deference to DR because of it's auto-play, versus Heed the Dream might need to be held back until some person at the table has 3 leadership resources to trigger the second ability.

6. Messenger of the King

Lock: ???

Honorable Mention: ???

Okay, here, I have nothing. MotK has so many different permutations, and leads itself to so many different styles, I couldn't possibly pick a lock. That's why I have a feeling this will grow to become the community's favorite contract because even after years of exploration, it might still surprise you (if I may paraphrase the grey wizard). I ran Bofur, Ioreth, and Bilbo with this contract and let me say, those were radically different decks with radically different needs. If I am missing something here, let me know.

7. Bond of Friendship

Lock: A Good Harvest

Honorable Mention: Favor of the Valar

With a quad-sphere, perfectly balanced deck among the spheres, this is no contest. Every deck ought to run this sphere-balancing card. Plus, deck-builders are going to run into trouble finding the right neutral cards to fit the need of the deck, so that is why Favor of the Valar comes in so close. Threat will be high; that's a given. Between these two cards, you have 4 neutral cards cleaned up, and probably will be running at least one Gandalf as well. The tie-breaker between these cards comes from the fact that, perhaps, a deck is running with Hobbits, a couple copies of The Shirefolk will be more effective than FotV. But certainly not for AGH which will still be needed in that deck.

 

Tell me your thoughts! Did I miss any good cards for the contracts? Am I way off on others? What is the best card for the MotK!

> Dude that is awesome that you made Galdor work! I have been meaning to give him an honest try. Do you have the decklist for inspiration? I have mostly been playing grey wanderer with Haldir in which case the starting questing willpower of 4 plus being ready to snipe and kill enemies in the staging area means you don’t really need to worry about combat at all. So allies just help with questing.

 EVENT (22)

3x  A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014]
3x  Daeron's Runes [https://ringsdb.com/card/04108] (FoS)
3x  Deep Knowledge [https://ringsdb.com/card/07012]

2x  The Seeing-stone [https://ringsdb.com/card/07015]
3x  Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003]
2x  Will of the West [https://ringsdb.com/card/01049]


 

This is an ally blitz deck. Galdor of the Havens [https://ringsdb.com/card/11002] is the most reliable hero for maximizing early game copies of Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003] and A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014], and being  means he can run incredible card draw in the form of Daeron's Runes [https://ringsdb.com/card/04108], Deep Knowledge [https://ringsdb.com/card/07012], and Drinking Song [https://ringsdb.com/card/19116]. A Song of Kings [https://ringsdb.com/card/02010] from the The Grey Wanderer [https://ringsdb.com/card/22074] gives Galdor  access to more deck-thinning card draw in the form of We Are Not Idle [https://ringsdb.com/card/04129], while also granting the ability to attach Steward of Gondor [https://ringsdb.com/card/01026] and play as many copies of Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003], and A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014] per turn as possible. Many The Grey Wanderer [https://ringsdb.com/card/22074] decks only seem to run Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003], and often they are set up to only play copy per turn as the deck's one non-unique off-sphere card per turn. This deck, on the other hand, aims to play 2-3 copies of Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003] and 2-3 copies of A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014] all in the first turn, giving you an impressive set of 4-5 cost bodies from Round 2 and onward, at which point the deck is hopefully gaining 5 resources per turn and playing at least one 4+ cost  or  ally.

Set-Up

Attach the The One Ring [https://ringsdb.com/card/21001] and fetch your lone master card, The Master Ring [https://ringsdb.com/card/21009]. Draw your six cards, then use Galdor's set-up ability. Never mulligan -- always use Galdor of the Havens [https://ringsdb.com/card/11002]' ability to discard and draw new cards, as the idea is to thin your deck out as much as possible while you ruthlessly search for Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003] and A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014]. When you pitch cards from your starting hand in lieu of taking a mulligan, keep only 1x Steward of Gondor [https://ringsdb.com/card/01026] and any and all card draw events. Depending on the nastiness of the Quest's treachery cards, you may either keep The Master Ring [https://ringsdb.com/card/21009] or toss it to increase the chances of finding Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003] and A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014].

Galdor of the Havens [https://ringsdb.com/card/11002]'s selective pitching and refilling, coupled with the copious amounts of card draw means that it is not uncommon to see 30 cards from your deck in your first Turn, with a good chance of playing multiple copies of Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003] and A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014]. In a pinch, you can use Ioreth [https://ringsdb.com/card/12117] or Ithilien Lookout [https://ringsdb.com/card/08008] in conjunction with a 4-5 cost ally to play A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014], hopefully at least netting on more 4-5 cost ally. An Ithilien Lookout [https://ringsdb.com/card/08008] and a 5 cost ally can combine on A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014] to grab two 4 cost allies, so that's the best math when telling a tale using the Ithilien Lookout [https://ringsdb.com/card/08008]. Even in a desperate pinch, two Ithilien Lookout [https://ringsdb.com/card/08008]s can A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014] to snag a 4-5 cost ally, which is still usually a net gain.

Don't be too worried about rapidly filling your discard pile due to Galdor's starting hand purge, Daeron's Runes [https://ringsdb.com/card/04108], or A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014], as you can always play Will of the West [https://ringsdb.com/card/01049] as your first out-of-sphere card in a later round to recover your entire discard pile (along with all of those sweet card drawing events, Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003], and A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014] cards already played. It's not unusual to play the same Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003] or A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014] card multiple times over the course of a game, as even if you are out of Secrecy paying 4  for Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003] is still always a good deal, as you're likely to get a 4-5 cost ally in exchange.

Glorfindel [https://ringsdb.com/card/12006], the Knight of Dale [https://ringsdb.com/card/17110]s, and the Giant Bear [https://ringsdb.com/card/19061]s can self-ready, meaning they can be used to quest and tell a tale, or they can even be used twice to tell tales as needed. Glorfindel [https://ringsdb.com/card/12006] in particular is very valuable, because his discard-to-self-ready effect is very handy for getting down to 0 Cards in your hand, allowing Galdor of the Havens [https://ringsdb.com/card/11002] to use his once-per-game ability to redraw 6 new cards. If you can get Glorfindel [https://ringsdb.com/card/12006] into play during your first round, it's even possible to trigger this before the end of the round, potentially getting 6 more chances at finding first round Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003] and A Very Good Tale [https://ringsdb.com/card/131014].

This deck tends to, on average, put about 20 resources of allies/attachments into play by the end of the first round. It's best opening ever put into play 49 resources worth of allies on the first round, and a handful of other openings have also exceeded the 30 resource mark. But, there is the rare disastrous start where, despite seeing more than half of the deck on Round 1, you just don't come into any copies of Timely Aid [https://ringsdb.com/card/04003], which is hard to rally from. Fortunately, this is very unlikely statistically.


(Copy-n-pasted from my RingsDB deck, sorry if any of the formatting gets lost in translation.  Haven't touched this deck in a few months, and I did most of my quests using the more painful Set-Up happens in Step 7 rulings (hence the two copies of Song of Kings)... given that it sounds like Caleb is now okay with Set-Up stuff back in Step 2, could drop a Song of Kings for Protector of Lorien, then a back-up is nice if stuff discards your attachments).
