Hi Folks,

for example i have Vigilant Guard and Dwarven Shield attached zu Tactics Gimli:


VIGILANT GUARD

Attachment. Cost: 3.

Skill.

Attach to a Warrior character. Limit 1 per character.

Attached character gets +2 hit points.

Response: When another character would be assigned any amount of damage, place 1 of that damage on attached character instead.


DWARVEN SHIELD

Attachment. Cost: 2.

Item. Armor.

Attach to a Dwarf hero. Restricted.

Attached hero gets +1 DEF.

Response: After attached hero takes damage from an enemy attack, exhaust Dwarven Shield to add 1 resource to attached hero's pool.

Can i use the response of the Dwarven Shield when getting 1 damage via Vigilant Guard by an enemy attack which damages another character?
For me the 1 damage via Vigilant Guard is caused by an enemy attack.

I think it would work, but it's not 100% clear to me.  Might be worth checking with Caleb.

I think the key here is that Vigiiant guard is using a replacement effect "instead" to change where the damage goes, and not a response that prevents the original damage and creates a new point.

I can't see it being worth bothering Caleb.
