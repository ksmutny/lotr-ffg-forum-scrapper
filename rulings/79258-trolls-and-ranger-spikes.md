Hey all,

In We Must Away Ere Break of Day, Bert's card reads:

"Players cannot play attachments on Troll enemies."

The card Ranger Spike reads: 

"Play Ranger Spikes into the staging area unattached.  If unattached, attach Ranger Spikes to the next eligible enemy that enters the staging area."

Are the trolls eligible targets when they enter the staging area on quest card 2B?  The card is never played on the Troll, it is played into the staging area.  It is simply attached on the troll -- and there is no prohibition on the trolls having attachments, as far as I can tell.  Only a play restriction.

Would make this quest super easy if you could get 3 Ranger Spikes into the staging area before 2B!

Whoa.  That's amazing.  I didn't even think about that.  It would definitely make this scenario too easy if you did that, but it sounds right.  Unless by playing Ranger Spikes and putting it into the staging area, you are technically "playing" it on the trolls.  I don't know.  You might want to send in this question to Caleb Grace or something.

I kind of hope they DON'T rule in that way.  As I see it, there's nothing about the troll card that makes them ineligible.  You can't play Burning Brand on Dain because he's not eligible -- there's a play restriction.  Players solve this by MAKING him eligible (add a Lore icon).  What if you could bypass the play restriction?  I'm suggesting that there is an intentional difference between the use of the verb "attach" and the use of the verb "play."  In this case, it looks like Trolls can have attachments, you just can't PLAY the attachment on them.  We'll see what Caleb thinks!

Okay, I get your point. There's indeed a difference in the wording if you compare the troll's text with Mumakil's. To me bot translates to "no attachments on this enemy", as this was clearly the intention for the Hobbit scenatio, but you might be right about this.

And official response:

"You are correct. The Ranger Spikes are played into the staging area and not on the trolls. Therefore, the troll's game text "Players cannot play attachments on Troll enemies" does not apply. Cheers, Caleb"

Happy hunting gentlemen…
