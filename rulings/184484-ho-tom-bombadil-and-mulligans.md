According to the Black Riders rules, Setup instructions on Player cards happen before you draw your first hand. The Setup instructions on the Ho! Tom Bombadil! boon instruct you to add the card to your hand. Does that mean that if I mulligan my first draw, I have to shuffle Ho! Tom Bombadil! into my decK?

I asked questions to Caleb about setting up cards in campaign mode, and this was one of them. Waiting for confirmation.
