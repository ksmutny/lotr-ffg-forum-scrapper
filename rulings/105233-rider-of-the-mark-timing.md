As far as I remember, there is several action windows during the enemy attack resolving, one of which is between flipping'n'resolving shadow card and dealing damage from attack.

 

So, lets assume, the revealed shadow card is +3 attack, if we spend this 1 resource and give Rider of the Mark to the player being attacked and discard already flipped and resolved card - will +3 attack bonus vanish?

Dug this up from a BGG [http://boardgamegeek.com/article/11116560#11116560] posting regarding timing for this very card: (TL;DR: While RIder of the Mark can remove a shadow card after it's revealed, removing the card doesn't cancel any effect such as bonus to attack).

An official response is in!

If a shadow card is discarded by card effect, then the players do not resolve its shadow effect.
However, there is no action window for Rider of the Mark to be used after a shadow card is revealed during combat. Step 3 of Resolving Enemy Attacks (when shadow cards are revealed) must be completely resolved before the players can take actions.
To take advantage of the Rider of the Mark's ability, you need to trigger it before a shadow card is revealed.

So it seems my interpretation of events was correct. After the effect happens (such as +

), the effect does not depend on the shadow card's continued existence but rather naturally times out.

Wait, I am confused about this part.

Event cards are discarded after their effect has been resolved, so I have always discarded Blade Mastery at the end of phase when the boost was over.

Have I been playing wrongly this entire time? Do you discard event cards such as Blade Mastery, Sneak Attack, Feint, Thicket of Sphere right after you play them without waiting for their effect to be fully over (i.e. wait till end of phase)?

Similarly, the effect of an event card is not dependent on the card being "in play". Rather the card immediately goes to the discard pile. You could certainly leave the card on the table to help you remember the effect, but it isn't necessary. 

Edit. Here's what I posed to FFG:

fyrian wrote:
If a shadow card is discarded (using Rider of the Mark's ability for example) after it is revealed but before its effect influences the game, does the Shadow effect still occur?

For example, suppose an attacking enemy is dealt Dol Guldur orcs as a shadow card. Then after the shadow card is revealed but before the attacker deals combat damage, Rider of the Mark is used to discard the shadow card. Does the attacker still get the +Attack bonus from Dol Guldur orcs?

If the attacker does get the +Attack bonus in the previous example, are there any shadow effects (to your immediate knowledge) that could be canceled by Rider of the Mark after the shadow card is revealed? (The original question specifically was if Chieftain of the Pit's shadow ability could be canceled.)

I think, "To take advantage of the Rider of the Mark's ability, you need to trigger it before a shadow card is revealed," is pretty clear.

Also an official answer from Caleb :
