The Grey Havens Expansion for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game Is Now Available

This goes all the way back to the very first Second Breakfast article:
https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/3/19/second-breakfast/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/3/19/second-breakfast/]

 

You'll notice that multiple core sets are needed to build this deck. There was a lot of feedback on the forums about players with one core set not being able to build this deck.

 

When the next Second Break article came out:
https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/4/12/second-breakfast-second-helpings/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/4/12/second-breakfast-second-helpings/]

It included this statement:
"Since then, several players have wondered if Caleb would be willing to post a deck built with only one copy of the game’s Core Set, and others questioned how the deck can function in multiplayer games, when the rising threats of other players’ decks would seem to render its ability to attack cards in the staging area less effective."

 

And the community rejoiced!

Has anyone asked Caleb about this one? Going to make some very serious changes to my decks if OhaUh Gandalf and Narya do indeed work like this.

I honestly don't see why do you even need to ask Caleb of that. You exhaust Gandalf, you choose Gandalf. Gandalf is eligible target as he is an ally, being exhausted is not even a requirement as it reads "choose and ready up to 2 allies", not "choose up to 2 exhausted allies and ready them".

If Gandalf is not exhausted you can't ready him and therefore don't pick him for the effect I would say.

 

I think FFG didn't bother writing "ready exhausted ally" as not exhausted ones can't be readied.

No reason to ask Caleb.  We Are Not Idle has two effects based on the same sentence structure (Do X to Y).  It has been asked and clarified that you can choose to draw the card first or add the resources first.  This means, that the do X to Y structure does not happen simultaneously.  If it did, you would not be able to choose which Y you perform first following X.  Even if they are simultaneous (and I'm incorrectly remembering the thing about We Are Not Idle), though, when two things happen at the same time, isn't it true that the first player chooses the order?  So then, why not choose the most beneficial order in the case of Narya/OHaUH Gandalf.

See, what you present here is your assumptions. What I wrote there is facts. You don't assume FFG didn't bothered to write something for some reason, you do exactly what the card tells you to do.
