I hope you guys are excited! As for me, I'll be my usual negative self and say I'm pretty meh to be honest. The mechanical aspect with the customization seems amazing, and the quest will probably fun and balanced. The theme of it though... I wonder if new players that just bought the core, are amped for WoR and saw this announcement will say "****, the game designers are really obsessed with Mirkwood". TBH I feel Caleb has been kind of redundant with the themes of his quests recently, I mean we were in Harad last cycle and he still made a spider quest! And now this... At least if these stages are an indication we might get Radagast hero, I'm all for it. 

So what are your presumably more positive thoughts on this?

It seems a really awesome idea. I’ll wait for Seastan to make an unbeatable quest that will force Caleb to errate encounter cards ?

Full rules here: https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/8e/3f/8e3f6062-43ad-4a24-a5e3-1c61312500c7/the_wizards_quest_rules.pdf [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/8e/3f/8e3f6062-43ad-4a24-a5e3-1c61312500c7/the_wizards_quest_rules.pdf]

This seems super-neat. And Woodland's Realm was confirmed by Caleb to be the Fellowship event this year, so as you can see from these rules, we'll have a bounty of customization available to us this year. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
