# [Stand and Fight ruling removed from FAQ?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80539-stand-and-fight-ruling-removed-from-faq/)

So I wrote on my blog about the solo deck I've been playing and someone mentioned that you cannot play 'Stand and Fight' on Gandalf because he does not belong to a sphere.  This seemed contradictory to the wording on the card but I read that it had been ruled that way.  I looked in the official FAQ but did not see it.  Someone told me it was there and after some Googling I found that the ruling was in v1.3 of the FAQ but it is no longer in the most current v1.4 on the FFG support page.

Does this mean that this ruling has been recinded and it can be played on Gandalf or is this just a mistake?

I just have the confirmation from Caleb Grace that it has misteriously disapeared from the FAQ. But the ruling hasn't changed. It will be back in the next release. Probably in the Q&A section.

Yeah, I got the same response:

 

Hi Adam,
I was a bit surprised myself when someone discovered that the entry for Stand and Fight had disappeared from version 1.4 of the FAQ. I can assure you that was unintended and quite accidental however it happened. Since the damage is already done, I will probably move the entry to the Q&A section of the next FAQ since the previous entry wasn't really an errata but a clarification.
It still doesn't work with Gandalf because Gandalf does not belong to a sphere of influence, sorry.
Thanks for asking,
Caleb

 

 

I still think that it should be an errata, since I agree with Thanatopsis.
