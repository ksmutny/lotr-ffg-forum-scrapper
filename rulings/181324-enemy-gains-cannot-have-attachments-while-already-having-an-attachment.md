Hey all, hoping some of you can weigh in on this. I was playing Nightmare Conflict at the Carrock and had an attachment on one of the trolls, and then I killed Stuart and placed him in the victory display. Stuart has the effect that he gives every other troll enemy +1 defense and they gain "Cannot have attachments." Does this mean that I would discard any attachments already on the trolls? Or are attachments on enemies the same as player cards, where they only check when being played that the criteria for playing them is met? Thanks.

Caleb was playing a game at GenCon with a couple of the guys from Grey Company, I believe, and they were laughing about how hero Beorn, who has the same text "cannot have attachments", got a Citadel Plate while his text box was blanked by Lord of the Dead. After The Lord of the Dead was killed, I'm pretty sure Beorn kept the suit of armor even though it didn't do anything. However, I'm not sure because "cannot have attachments" is a constant effect.
