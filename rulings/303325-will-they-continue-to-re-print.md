I'd say there is probably no one who can answer this, but here goes.  Since FFG won't be releasing hardly anything for this game once the current cycle is done, will they keep doing re-prints on the old stuff?  I would assume they will because they still have the license.  But I was wondering if anyone has heard anything.

I still need stuff to complete my collection, a lot of stuff, and I'd hate to pay scalper prices.  I'd rather wait for re-prints.  Thanks!

I don't much like the hiatus, but they didn't just say the game was going on hiatus, they also said that when the game resumed it would not be a second edition.  If they really intended this to be the end, why not say so?  Further, if the reasoning for soft-selling the hiatus is to avoid sabotaging sales, why not keep selling?  In order to keep selling, they need to reprint, and as long as reprints sell quickly they profit from doing so.

The cause of the hiatus is easy to see -- Marvel Champions, which has Caleb Grace (and Nate French) named as designers.  This is very hot right now, and my fear is that printing new Champions products will be more lucrative than reprinting LOTR expansions for quite some time.  With that said, new products and reprints aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, depending on how much manufacturing capacity they can contract and how much storage they have.  And if the Champions LCG model proves highly successful, we might see a continuation of the game with pre-made hero decks and independent quests, so the dependency between Deluxe and AP is broken.

I'm not currently very worried about the absence of "awaiting reprint" LOTR titles -- as far as I can see there are no awaiting reprint entries for ANY FFG game.

The person that said this is leaving the company.  I think that speaks volumes to the hiatus being a soft, the game has ended.  But we’ll leave the door open to a possible return at some possible future time, maybe.
