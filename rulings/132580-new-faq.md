It's an update day I guess! Two articles in one day.  Here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=5330] is the FAQ article.

 

Big notables:

-Will of the West now removes itself from the game after being played

-Blue Mountain Trader limited once per round

The distinction between "adding" and "moving" was made some time ago, but this FAQ also says that "gaining" includes both "adding" and "moving", so that means Errand-rider could work to activate Heir of Mardil, for example.

Unfortunately, Harbor Master does not work with Errand-rider. Caleb has already clarified this, and it is confirmed in the latest FAQ. Harbor Master says "After a card effect adds any number of resources", this only works with effects that increase the total number of resources under player control. Moving resources does *not* count as *adding* resources, but *moving* and *adding* both count as *gaining* resources. The other relevant verb is *collecting* which is not a card effect as it is part of the framework of the game and happens automatically during the resource phase (and does also count as *gaining* resources).
