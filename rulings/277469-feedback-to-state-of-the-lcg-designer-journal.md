For those that haven't seen it, here's the designer journal where Caleb makes some comments about LoTR LCG (scroll to bottom). Click here [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/6/8/state-of-the-lcg/]

Essentially he's making the point that he's considering some sort of campaign play.

Just to say that I'd favour that. The game is 6 or so years old with thousands of player cards and the equivalent of about 11 - 12 full cycles. Something I struggle with is how much more of the same do I really need? 

I know it's controversial, but I personally think  the card game is ready for a change and perhaps bring some of the best of AH TCG into it. I'd be up for a 2nd edition - I don't see it as invalidating what I've already bought at all, but rather enhancing it.

From Caleb’s comment in the article, we are definitely getting one or more characters in this cycle that people have been asking for for a while. At this point, Thranduil is the one everyone is expecting, myself included. Caleb seems to take all of the repeatedly requested characters seriously though, so I would expect to see a Radagast hero in the game’s life at some point, or at least an updated ally.  Gwaihir hero seems likely, as that one is often called for. And Spirit Aragorn. Not expecting to see all of that in the upcoming cycle, mind you...  Personally I would like to see alternate versions of Frodo and Bilbo (which can be used outside the the Saga expansions).
