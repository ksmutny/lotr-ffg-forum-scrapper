How is your memory?

 

Is there a Action phase AFTER the escape cards are revealed but before the escape test resolves?

 

 1. The Escape is initiated
 2. You commit your characters to the test.
 3. You draw the cards for the test (all other effects on the cards are ignored)
 4. You add the escape values (if no value is printed on the card it = 0) and compare it to your characters committed will (or attack if the test is form that treachery) 
 5. The Escape Test resolves
 6. If you pass the test nothing happens, if you fail pay the fail cost.

I am pretty sure this is how they resolve.

 

The question then is, can I use a action between 5/6? Can i say tap Faramir or discard for Protector of Lorien to boost the WILL in a test on the characters, before the resolution of the effect occurs but AFTER the escape value is revealed? 

 

Thanks in Advance

Well thanks to all for your incredibly interesting discussion! hehe

Question

Escape Tests (The Dead Marshes)

Is there the opportunity to play actions during the resolution of a escape test, after the escape cards have been dealt but before the players will is calculated? As in a similar window to the quest phase after the staging area is revealed but before quest tokens are placed.

Answer

No, there is no action window at that time. The only action window during an Escape test is after committing characters to the test but before dealing cards from the encounter deck.

Cheers,
Caleb
