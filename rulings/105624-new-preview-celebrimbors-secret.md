I just want to say - I was wrong. I am overwhelmed at how awesome hero Galadriel looks with Narya!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Galadriel = perfect design (playtest experience pending).  Great job Caleb & Co.  I like seeing heroes follow this line of design:  good synergy, but also globally useful.  Her drawback is thematic and non-crippling, IMO.  Just keep it up!

I'm a little late to the party but how cow, i'm excited to use Galadriel.  I also love how she complements the silvan archetype without either party really needing her by necessity, really great touch.  I love the versatility and player choice they gave us with her too between the high will power and card draw/threat reduction (although UC obviously mitigates this choice).  I think I'm mostly just happy to have another universally useful spirit hero.

 

Exciting to see our first official Ent too, even with the thematically appropriate 1st turn exhaust is till think they are super powerful. WIll be cool to see more of their kind.

 

Lastly, seeing Orophin as a leadership ally just as to mean we get Haldir as a lore hero in the 3rd AP right? Would be appropriate getting all 3 of them this cycle and i dont think they'll change his sphere as he could only go in spirit without doubling up with his brothers and if he was spirit that means we'd have 3 spirit heroes this cycle which seems unlikely.

 

Assuming we do get a lore haldir, that likely means that that the ranger hero in the 4th AP and the hero of the 6th AP would be leadership and tactics to make it 2 heroes per sphere per cycle

 

Also curious to see who our last hero will be, i figured if we were gonna see Galadriel it would have been in the 6th for the grand finale, Caleb and co may have to outdue themselves on this one

Manwe maybe  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]  (I mean, it has to be a Vala to be more powerfull than Galadriel after all)

 

I guess it will be a hero that will have to do with the next big box, like Theoden before the Isengard box, but I would wish for Cirdan, although I doubt we will get another Elf

SOLID GOLD ! ! !

 

Caleb and Matt really deliver with these new cards. Much has already been said about the mechanics of these new cards so I'm going to focus on the flavor. In the books Galadriel was the great enabler who was constantly working behind the scenes to fight Sauron but didn't actually get her own hands dirty. This is perfectly described by the mechanics (and art!) of these new cards. I think it's absolutely perfect and even though we haven't seen all of the elf cards yet, the functionality of the new elf deck is pretty obvious and it's a perfect flavor/mechanics matchup. I have no doubt that the new elf decks will feel very "elfy", especially to anyone who has read the books and knows the lore behind the elves. After "Black Riders" gave us flavorful hobbit decks I was very optimistic about what would come next but this is even better than I had hoped for.

 

Thank you Caleb and Matt, please keep up the good work!

 

Now please get these AP's out to us as soon as possible......
