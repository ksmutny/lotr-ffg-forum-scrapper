In a two player game, if I play Gildors counsel 

Event. Cost: 3.

Play during the Quest phase, before characters are committed to the Quest.

Action: Reveal 1 less card from the encounter deck this phase. (To a minimum of 1.)

 

And then playing partner plays Wait no longer 

Event. Cost: 2.

Response: At the beginning of the quest phase, search the top 5 cards of the encounter deck for an enemy and put it into play engaged with you. Then, reveal one less encounter card this phase (to a minimum of 0). Shuffle the encounter deck.

Does it stack down to zero cards revealed?

In 2, 3, and 4, the passive effect was reducing the cost before MoL was triggered, yet I was still able to get the cost down to 0 by choosing the order of how to apply the now 2 passive effects.
