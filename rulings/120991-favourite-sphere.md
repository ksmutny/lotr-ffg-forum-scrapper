So just for curiosity, what is your favourite sphere of this game? Leadership, tactics, lore or my favourite spirit, and why?

I myself like spirit because Eowyn and Glorfindel, pretty varied cards like threat management, location handling, questing cards and many others like card drawing, condition removing and readying cards. I also use Frodo Baggins and Nori a lot (i just love to use spirit Bofur with him).

A monosphere spirit two-handed solo player dressed in blue was about to play a Lotr LCG game with his fellow gamers with Glorfindel in his deck, a known overpowered card

 

”Before the game begins, you must get on your knees and worship Glorfindel and accept that he is the most useful hero the world has ever known, even greater than Dain Ironfoot!”

 

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-multisphere Navy SEAL champion who had played over 1500 Gencon games and understood the necessity of 1-copy cards in the starter set and fully supported all corporate decisions made by FFG stood up and held up a card.

 

”How much willpower does Theondred have, pinhead?”

 

The arrogant spirit player smirked quite elvishly and smugly replied “a mere 1 point, you Leadershit nerd”

 

”Wrong. It’s a 5 willpower hero with Celembrian' Stone, Faramir and Sword that was Broken. If Glorfindel is the best hero in the game as you say… then it should be in the leadership sphere"

 

The spirit player was visibly shaken, and dropped his tokens and copy of Silmarilion. He stormed out of the room crying those spirit crocodile tears. The same tears elven lovers cry for the “weak cards" (who today are favored by the metagame so much, most decks are over 100+ cards strong) when they jealously try to claw justly earned tools from the other deserving spheres. There is no doubt that at this point our player, nicknamed Drizzt Do Urden, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and went back to CCGs and booster packs. He wished so much that he had a leadership deck to play with himself, but he had used all purple cards as proxies for Ethir Swordsmen!

 

The other players applauded the SEAL and all played siege and battle quests that day and accepted Dain Ironfoot as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Gwaihir" flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the quest card. The Hobbit was read several times, and Caleb himself showed up and converted all existing heroes to their Leadership versions.

 

The spirit nerd lost his deck and sold his cards the next day. He died in poverty without Steward of Gondor and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.
