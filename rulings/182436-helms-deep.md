Hi. I've got question about resolving "forced" effects from quest cards. Suppose that I "stay" in stage 1B. At the end of the round, I have "forced" effect to advance to stage 2A. After I resolve "when revealed" in 2A, I proceed to 2B. And my question is: Do I have to resolve "forced" effect of 2B in this round (still first round) or not? Thanks for your help.

I have an official answer from Caleb at this question:

,,No. You should not trigger the end of round Forced effect on stage 2B unless you began the round at stage 2B."
