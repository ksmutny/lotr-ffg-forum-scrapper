Ok, so when I first saw them, I was a bit shocked. I guess they all look fine except for Sam who looks hilarious, and then I was shocked at the spheres they chose for each of them. Sam in Leadership? that's, well, an interesting choice. Since Caleb said he based the hobbits off of the lotr as  a whole and not only from the beggining of fotr (Sam as mayor of the shire, Merry stabbing the Witch King, etc) I guess these will be the only versions of these heroes that we're going to see. If that's the case, I guess I'm fine with that.

ok....first things first- i challenge anyone to say that merry doesnt look like his film version- he is the DOUBLE of dominic monaghan

 

 

so with that out of the way, onto the cards.

 

SAM. - i dont mind the art. its not amazing, but i dont see it as stupid either. Calebs idea of leadership is something that i wouldnt go to personally, sams leadership traits certainly do not overpower his spirit as a character, but thats ok, it makes sense in a way

 

MERRY - tactics was thought up from the start so im not surprised there. ive already mentioned the art

 

PIPPIN - i disagree with the sphere choice here. i do not consider the case good enough to put pip as lore. a similar case could be made for merry who led the 4 hobbits through the old forest- he was afterall a brandybuck who knew more about that area even than frodo. personally i would have made him spirit (which we already have hence i would have left him out)

love the art though, and despite thinking he looked like astin from the banner spoiler its much better up close

 

now, i am dissapointed not to see fredegar bolger. i was sure we would see him. surely he will be an ally. personally like someone said above, i would rather have seen no pippin and used his old version (already calling it old, and i havnt even got him!!) and seen fatty

 

all that seems like im dissapointed with the cards....so to balance it out here's what i like

 

calebs idea of the hobbits getting stronger as they perform heroic acts is very thematic and something i hadnt really considered and as i have said before its great that the designers are considering theme and lore first

 

im really trying to think of more good things to say here, but for the time being i am going to reserve my main judgement until i have the pack as i really want this to be the best expansion yet as it is based on my favourite piece of tolkiens writings...which i am sure it will be

Well there is going to be a fourth hobbit hero in the expansion which was not spoiled yet. We can assume that hero will be Spirit (and Rich, he could be Fredegar).

 

I also was initially not too impressed with the Sam card art, but after looking at the higher res image, it doesn't look that bad. It looks like he's staring into the eyes of Shelob, almost consumed with fear, but not quite...

 

I second what Rich said about the sphere assignments. Everything can be made a case for except Pippin as Lore. They probably put themselves into a bind when committed to releasing a Spirit Pippin in AtS. I think Merry could make a better case for being Lore with the library he put together and his trips to Rivendell. Caleb could have said something about Pippin spending a lot of time in the libraries in Gondor after the War of the Ring.

Yes looks like in Decipher previous game again. Very cool Sam without any problem deal with  Witch-King. Hate it!

Stupid, nasty hobbitses. I like more idea of hobbits just a sneak hide and run. Now we will see Merry Fighter like a  Aragorn.

Also a bit dissapointed.....

wow, quite surprised at the negativity around the cards considering how much i love all of them.

 

the art is pretty good with clearly Pippin> Sam> Merry IMO

 

i really dont mind the sphere choices at all, we cant nitpick all day about the merrits of any one hobbit in any one sphere but they cant all be spirit or lore so i thought Caleb did a very fine job fitting the characters into spheres while still maintaining the essence of the game (4 heroes 4 spheres per saga expansion)

 

the powers are really great and i cannot wait to build a hobbit deck with these guys along with the other toys they'll get in the box.  anyone who has already tried to build a hobbit deck with the current cards surely already realizes how underpowered they are at the time so i dont mind Merry's potential 3 or 4 attack if it means i dont have to rely on the hobbit gandalf each turn to kill anything

 

i also love how well they synergize with each other as was already stated in the article, Pippin's ability is so unique and cool that it already makes his current incarnation seem obsolete (also whats up with Pippin just having the two best art depictions by far?! they must really love him)

> I agree. I mean, just look at The Steward's Fear. In just one pack, Outlands became a viable deckbuilding option. They could easily just feel one adventure pack with all secrecy cards. Not that it would be enough, but it would definitely bolster secrecy's strength. I would be curious to know why they haven't given it more attention.

b

In my opinion designers see secrecy can be very unbalanced in the future and will ve more and more difficult keepna good balance with this mechanic.

Im pretty sure if spirit Glorifindel was a secrecy hero with text: if you control another 2 heroes discard Glorifindel from play then yes. But they was not really serious about it. And then caleb come and things start to change. Will be no secrecy.
