As you might know Druadan forest player card spoilers are already up at http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=822512 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=822512] and it already made my head spin at rules.

Card in question is white tower watchman, and I have two diferent points on it:

A) Can you achieve "each hero belongs to same sphere" effect with songs, Aragorns heirloom colection or other card effects that give hero aditional sphere icon?

 

B) how does undefended attack redirection interacts with quests that say "undefended attacks hit Golum, or battlefield locations"? (return to mirkwood, Siege of Cairn andros)

i think this may be of help

this was regarding good meal and songs but it applies here

Hi Richard,
That's a good question. Since the resource icon indicates which sphere a hero belongs to, if a hero gains an additional resource icon from a card effect, then the hero will belong to that sphere as well. That will allow you to combo cards like Good Meal with the song cards.
Cheers,
Caleb
