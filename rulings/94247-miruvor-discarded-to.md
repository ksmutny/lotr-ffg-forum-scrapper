It reads:

Attach to a hero.
Action: Discard Miruvor to (choose two): ready attached hero, add 1 resource to attached hero's resource pool, attached hero gets +1 [Willpower] until the end of the round, or put Miruvor on the top of your deck.

If you attach to a hero of another player, and the other player chose "put Miruvor on the top of your deck". Where is it going to? To my deck or to the deck of the player that controls attached hero?

Well, it gives you the option, but if you don't have anyway to play it back, putting it on top of your deck is kind of dumb. But that's a problem with you, not with the card... Joking, I agree it's strange, but we were curious and we had an answer from Caleb, I think it is a "we didn't plan it but it's cool" design.

> Controller's deck, as "your" refere to the controller, and it is golden rulling the ownership rules.

 

 

In the case of all of FFG's other LCG games, cards leaving play, as in the quote offered up by n Krokodiler,  go to their owner's out of play area. You're correct, 'your' refers to the controller, but this destination change overwrites that. Wording in later LCGs has made that clearer (that it's not an exception to the golden rule), but it's been consistently ruled as such in every other LCG I've played. In the case of Miruvor, the controller would be able to choose any 2 of the 4 options, and if he chooses the 'top of your deck' it'll go to the top of the owner's deck, not the controller's.

 

I would be quite surprised if Caleb or Matt ruled otherwise. If they did, I'd love to see the specific wording.

Alogos is correct, and if fact this question was already asked of Caleb (full thread [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/841502/miruvor-top-which-deck-now-official-reply]: link to reply [http://boardgamegeek.com/article/9823517#9823517] shown below)

I wrote:
The card Miruvor is an attachment that is played on a hero. I can play it on another player's hero and that player then controls (but doesn't own) the card.

When that player triggers the "Action:" on the card he may select 2 of the listed effects. One of the effects that can be selected reads:
"put Miruvor on the top of your deck"

My question is, does that player then:
a) indeed put it on the top of his deck (the controller)
b) put it on the top of my deck (the owner)


A support for option b) is that the rules (p.25) talk about control and ownership and says that "when a card leaves play, it reverts to its owner's hand, deck or discard pile".

A support for option a) is that this is covered by the golden rule and the card clearly tells the person activating the card to put it on the top of his deck which contradicts the rulebook.

Hi Daniel,
When resolving Miruvor's ability, the Golden Rule will supersede the Ownership rule. For example, if Player A attaches Miruvor to Player B's hero and Player B chooses the option "put Miruvor on the top of your deck" then Player B player will put Miruvor on top of his deck.

Caleb


Thanks Caleb!

Yeah... let's just ask Caleb for the hundredth time.
