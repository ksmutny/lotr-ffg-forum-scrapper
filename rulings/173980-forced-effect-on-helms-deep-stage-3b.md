Hey there,

 

Not sure how many people had a chance to play the Helm's Deep scenario yet but I am wondering about the transition from Stage 2 to 3. Stage 3B has a forced effect that reads: "After resolving the quest, if the encounter deck did not place at least 1 progress on this stage as the result of questing, the first player reveals 1 encounter card". If the encounter deck completes Stage 2 during the questing phase, does this effect trigger right away as the resolution just happened and no progress was placed here? Or does it only trigger the next round?

 

Cheers,

Michael

Just got an official response fom Caleb. It's not the ruling I had hoped for but I guess it makes sense given the different phrasing from SaF stage 2B (not clear when "after resolving questing" is exactly).

> In retrospect, stage 3B probably should have been worded: “After resolving the quest at this stage, if the encounter deck…” to make it clearer that you only trigger that effect after questing at that stage. I may add that to our next FAQ.
