Not all of these characters were in the books right? Where does FFG get its inspiration for the missions and characters that are not directly from the main story? I am interested in the creative process of it all.

Mirlonde. But yea, I don't know what you are expecting to get for an answer. I doubt that Caleb and Matt will share on here or that anyone here would have that knowledge.

I have heard, though, that some (if not all) of the characters that they came up with were actually characters that FFG created and used in other older LotR games. I have not verified this though.

Yes, Thalin, Eleanor and Beravor come from FFG game Middle-Earth Quest

Thanks for pointing this out -- I was not aware that these 3 heroes had appeared in a previous Lord of the Rings-themed board game.
