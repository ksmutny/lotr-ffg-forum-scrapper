Hey guys,

 

We recently had the honor to sit down with LotR LCG developer Caleb Grace! He was great, and offered up some fantastic insight into the development of the game, so we had to share this!

 

Disclaimer: It is a long interview, but you cannot put restraints on nerdery this pure.

Really cool interview, but I was so disappointed when you censored Caleb's "spoilers". The second one is obvious, but the first one ("I'm happy to confirm ******") I really REALLY want to know what it was!

We made the edits per Caleb's request. The information is in the conversation preceding the "spoiler." He checked and it was determined that the information shouldn't be released yet.

While we could have simply removed the entire question, that just wouldn't be the COTR style.

Will they be released later on? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Just finished listening.

First, great episode! Really shows who's working on our beloved game and tells us his story. So next time something gets delayed, you at least know that it's aalso not his fault and that he hates delays too. It ahowed his love for this game, he even played it before designing it, and how much work goes into everything. Thanks guys and thank you Caleb!

For the spoiler:

i think it went like this: "I ca tell you that [a new Theoden] will be released.

Brian:"So can you tell us when this [new version of Theoden] is coming?

Caleb:"The [new version of Theoden] is coming in the Saga expasion the Treason of Saruman.

Also I found it quite funny when Brian says :'something that they can only know if they were listening to our episode'. Brandon: 'a nugget'. Instead of that we got nothing but dolphin sound, not even dolphin meat, lol.

Have still only listened to the first 2 hours of this mammoth episode but absolutely loving it. I forget who mentioned it in the podcast but they said how things have been "different"....for the better since Caleb took over and I think possibly a good adjective would be there is a lot of transparency between the player base and the designers.  Its incredibly refreshing to hear from the design team especially in such a candid matter regarding the process of design, the individual's own fandom and thought process, etc.  I feel lucky to be a part of such a unique gaming situation. I hope Caleb and Matt will continue to have access to the community in this manner.

Part of what made this episode so entertaining is that Caleb (and the CotR guys) just come across as extremely likeable.

 

It also didn't feel like an author on a book tour trying to drum up interest in product, but rather someone talking about a genuine passion project who actually wanted to be there.  As a consumer it's always nice to see something you are passionate about be represented with the same enthusiasm from a content creators standpoint.  Although I do wish we had more players (and events) in the UK.

 

Oh and Theodon in saga box three isn't really a spoiler at this point, unlike say, the Gollum hero coming in box four. *drops mic*
