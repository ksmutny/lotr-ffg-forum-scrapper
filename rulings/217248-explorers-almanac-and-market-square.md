Who, if anyone, raises his threat if progress is placed onto a location in the staging area as a result of Explorer's Almanac while Market Square is in play?  It seems a bit odd to me that the wording is "after a player places...progress" and not "after a player card effect places...progress" on Market Square. 

 

1) The first player

2) The player who controls Explorer's Almanac

3) The player who physically takes tokens from the bank and puts them on the location (basically player's choice)

4) The player who convinced everyone it was a good idea to place the progress on the location

5) No one

6) Other

> Hi Chris,
> 
> Placing progress from questing successfully is a framework action that happens automatically as a result of questing successfully, and Explorer’s Almanac simply redirects that progress to a location. So in essence, the game is placing that progress on the location and no one raises their threat from Market Square.

Awesome! I was so hoping this was the ruling!  I really like Explorer's Almanac.
