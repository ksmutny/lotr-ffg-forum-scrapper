So, I've been doing some thinking.

 

From the announcement article: "Its 165 new cards (three copies of each of player card) transport players to the realm of Gondor, where new heroes and allies stand firm against the armies of Mordor in thrilling battles, sieges, and three new scenarios!" 

 

"Heirs of Númenor gives you the opportunity to command some of Middle-earth’s greatest heroes in a region at war against the forces of evil."

 

"As with the game’s first deluxe expansion, Khazad-dûm [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm.asp?eidm=103], Heirs of Númenor transports The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game to a new region..."

 

I've been wondering if cycles really focus on traits or if they are simply a region to play in. In other words, the Dwarrowdelf cycle didn't give us a single Dwarf hero and many of the cards weren't Dwarf specfic (though, of course, some were)...

 

Similarly, Mirkwood, if anything, should have been elves but it was more eagles than anything.

 

But, then there is this from The Steward's Fear announcement article...

 

"That leads us to one of the other design goals for the cycle: to give players the cards they need to build strong Gondor decks. In the same way that the Dwarrowdelf [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=2&esum=196] cycle focused around Dwarves, the player cards in the Against the Shadow cycle center around Gondor and her allies. Each of the other traits in the game receives some attention, but most of the player cards are meant to bolster the Gondor trait."

 

So, I am somewhat confused. I was beginning to believe cycles are simply representing regions and aren't meant to build up a particular trait from that region - but this blurb from Caleb seems to suggest otherwise.

 

With the 4th AP now spoiled, however, there is next to no Gondor synergy in the game and I doubt the final two APs can really deliver.

 

I don't know if it's a bad thing, per se, but the previous quote really did set expectations that - at this point with 2 APs to go - hasn't really been met.

 

Thoughts?

it might be worth adding that the cards were already designed by the time the current designers came on board:

 

"When I [Caleb Grace] started working on the Against the Shadow cycle, most of the initial design had already been done by Lukas Litzsinger and Nate French, who were working with a story crafted by the company’s CEO, Christian Petersen. My role in this collaboration was to develop all of those designs and ideas into a finished product. It was a fun challenge, and I’m proud of the set that we’ve created together. I think fans of the game are going to love each installment in this cycle."

 

that's not to say Caleb didn't have some input, I'm sure he did, but these cards were all designed a long time ago (around the beginning of Dwarrowdelf, I believe) and the game has changed much since then.

 

The Saga Expansions - which were Caleb's - I think are much better. So, I look forward to the upcoming Sagas and a cycle that Caleb has been involved with from the beginning!
