Nickpes [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/user/205969-nickpes/],I think you can heal Merry because captives are in play,but not under any player control.You may ask Caleb to be sure.

Thank you, thats what I thought but since everytime I am not sure about something, I play it the way that will damage me, I did not heal him.

 

How can I contact Caleb plz ?

I expected to do this myself, but my understanding is that you cannot use "Beyond All Hope" on a Hero killed during that current game, because he's not in the fallen heroes list at that time (this happen when the game ends).

 

From the Black Rider rules:

First: "After the players defeat that scenario, they turn over the campaign card and follow any resolution instructions,[...]"

Then: "If a hero is in a player’s discard pile at the end of the game, that hero’s name is added to the list of Fallen Heroes in the Campaign Log"

 

This might just be a rule limitation, because it still makes sense thematically.

 

******************* EDIT ****************

 

OFFICIAL: I asked Caleb about this, and it turns out you can indeed use Beyond All Hope on a Hero that died during The Uruk-Hai scenario.
