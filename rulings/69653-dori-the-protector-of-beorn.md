So I sent FFG a note asking about Dori's response ability and if it can be used to absorb damage going to Beorn. The answer is yes:

Hi Paul,
Really glad to hear you're enjoying the Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill!
To answer your question: Yes, Dori can exhaust himself to take damage that would be assigned to Beorn. Dori's response targets the damage and not Beorn, so Beorn's immunity to player card effects is not a factor in this event.
Good question!
Caleb

This was mentioned as a possibility in an earlier thread, and maybe you all knew this, but now I do too! It is nice to know that there is some room for healing Beorn, in this response-type way and I think it will make him even more playable.

I can't think of any off the top of my head, but are there any other cards that have this type of response?

  Rule Question:
This question is in regards to locations that are immune to card effects (such as East Gate and Troll Cave).

Can cards such as Power in the Earth, Ancient Mathom, or Path of Need (or any other card that needs to attach to a location to trigger) attach to such locations and have their effect trigger?

Thanks so much!

Hi Matthew,
Good question. You can play attachments on locations that are immune to player card effects. If a card cannot have attachments, then it will read "Cannot have attachments." However, cards that are immune to player card effects will be immune to the abilities of attachments. So you can play Power in the Earth on the Troll Cave, but it will have no effect on that location. Card like Ancient Mathom and Path of Need work differently because they don't affect the location, so their abilities will still work.
Thanks for asking,
Caleb

I know this is an old thread. But I just realised that Caleb's ruling has changed in the latest FAQ 1.5:

 

Q: Can I play an attachment on an enemy or location

that is immune to player card effects.

A: No. Playing an attachment on a card is a form

of targeting, and cards with "immune to player card

effects" cannot be targeted by player cards.
