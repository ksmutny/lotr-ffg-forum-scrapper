Oh, and I too like this cycle. More and more so even.

Haven't played all the quests yet, but player card wise it has been a good batch. 

Not every cycle should be like dwarrowdelf in power, and even in there there were a number of coasters.

The ringmaker cycle was great too. This game has become better since Caleb & Matt took over.

IMO the AtS cycle was the worst. The Heirs of Numenor box had some good cards, sure.

But then in AtS the good cards are few and far between packs if you don't use outlands. 

Caleb & Matt's team really have to go and try to beat that cycle for the "worst cycle yet" crown.

I see what you mean, but I'm not sure I agree. I've come to appreciate the less shiny cards, so I quite like the cardpool of AtS. Dwarrowdelf is for me the worst cycle, as it really started power creep in the form of spirit Glorfindel of course, who I never play, as well as Elrond and maybe Aragorn which allows some very powerful combo decks.

Just to help memories back, AtS enabled the Gondor archetype (some good allies, and Visonary Leadership, Strength of Arms), it also marked the start of the Ranger-Trap archetype (two third of the lore cards of this cycle), the Record attachmentd, Caldara, and of course Outlands.

I would not argue though that AtS got the short hand hero-wise: Hirluin and Caldara enable a very particular deck, Faramir his not really good, Mirlonde Pippin and Theoden are niched
