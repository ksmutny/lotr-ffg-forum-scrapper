Sorry about unclear topic, but i need answer to this  :mellow: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_mellow.png]

 

If one of my heroes have this card "Caught in a web" (Counts as condition attachment)  and then enemy attacks my hero and shadow card what was dealt is "Driven by shadow" (Choose and discard 1 attachment from defending character) will that web thing go off?

 

And then other question, how can i use media library? Its really annoying to tell long texts of the cards.

jjeagle is right, the shadow text card on Driven by Shadow does not specify that you have to control the attachement.

 

We also had an official answer from Caleb to confirm this.
