I can't wait to go back and update my Eagles deck. Gwaihir with Descendant of Thorondor is going to be awesome.

I'm really jazzed about Gwaihir!  Kudos to Caleb & Co. for getting around to some eagle-love!  Lets see a little more!

 

As nice as it would be to see an eagle hero to properly head up an eagle-themed deck, I admit that he's a better fit as an ally.  Seems like it's been a while since we've had a 5 cost ally - not counting Citadel Custodian for obvious reasons.
