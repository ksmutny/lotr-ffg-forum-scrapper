Some shadow effects say "the defending player discards an attachment he controls."  Even if you do a Sentinel defense and defend for another player, the "defending player" is still the player that the enemy is engaged with.

 

But how about cards like this:

"Discard a non-objective attachment you control."

 

Is "you" shorthand for "the defending player," or would this hit the player with the Sentinel defender?

I think it means the character defending, not the player, as the wording is different from the "normal" sentence.

And the shadow effect plainly says "you" to the defending character I think.

this is just my reasoning, and there is only one way to know for certain. Ask caleb....
