FAQ has been updated. Horn of Gondor and Love of Tales have received errata, among other clarifications. I haven't read it all yet but I thought at least this much should be shared now.

My disappointment is that the lasting effects clarification reverses an unofficial ruling from Caleb. I was hoping to make thematic non-combat deck for A Shadow of the Past (still needs a bit more support), and Out of Sight ("Enemies engaged with you cannot attack you this phase.") is a key card in that deck because it can be played in the hide test action window, before all the Black Riders engage you. In response to a question I sent, Caleb said: "Any enemy that ends up engaged with you that phase will not attack, regardless of whether or not it was engaged with you at the time you played it." (Then I would return them to the staging area with Spirit Pippin to avoid attacks in the combat phase or, if I had enough willpower, race to finish the quest while avoiding combat with Hobbit-sense; I didn't say it was a good deck.) I'm handicapping myself enough for this quest that I think I might stick with Caleb's unofficial ruling.

Pretty sure they'd still do errata without the tournament format (is that the scoring stuff in the rulebook or the Against the Shadow one btw?). I've never gotten the impression they promoted that very heavily or really expected everyone to use it. I think I remember someone (either Matt / Caleb or maybe Nate French?) saying that the only reason it's there was to allow players used to competitive games a way of comparing themselves against each other.

 

Anyway, at least Horn of Gondor still triggers if you force Hero Treebeard to commit suicide. So there's that.

Maybe.

 

But honestly the fact that there is that officially supported competitive variant is the only reasonable explanation I've heard for why FFG should care (as they clearly do) about balancing against abusive and exploitable cards and combos that aren't in general use outside of those that intentionally choose to build exploit decks to break the game's core balancing. 

 

In the closed-system of a coop experience (ala any of FFG's coop board games) errata is used primarily to address misprints, oversights and--in extreme circumstances--game breaking and/or severely unbalancing factors that didn't appear during playtesting. But that's not how FFG erratas this game; they errata it for relative balance and to shut down potential exploit decks--just like they errata their other competitive LCGs. And the only conceivable reason to do that in a coop game is because they are assuming people are using the Scoring System they've put in place. 

 

As for why they added the scoring system at all, my understanding was that it was primarily a Sales and Marketing strategy. When they released the game they assumed a very similar audience (and similar audience behavior) to their other core LCGs. But in practice they found that while the game sold well people weren't playing it in large numbers at Cons or FLGSs (probably because pickup games of this are hard). That led them to change the scoring system to the current, official "Tournament Format" scoring to try and encourage more play by those competitive player that FFG saw as their bread and butter (and as a huge potential revenue bump in they could entice them to play, advertise and evangelize the game in local stores). 

 

 

> Success% should be the ultimate way to measure decks' strength. Honestly the score system promotes unsafe, risky plays just for the sake of scoring low, and that is not indicative of a well-played game imo

 

Agree that the current system is messy. 

 

But I would actually say that if you are trying to compare player vs player the most important variable is Deck Archetype. 

 

Beating a given, hard Quest with Gandalf-Outlands ia a very different accomplishment than beating the same hard Quest with Mono-Tactics Eagles or Rohan.
