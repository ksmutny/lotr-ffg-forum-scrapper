Ok ok ok Haha, I don't know any more than the next person, but I find it impossible to believe that before this game is done there wont be a raise the shire scenario.  I see it as an inevitability, I'm sorry if anyone had some false excitement over my comment.  I'll gladly bet anyone that it will happen and when it does I'm fairly certain it will be a gen con or fellowship quest that you can use in your campaign like fog on the Barrow downs.  

As a fan I would guess Caleb would, when the game ends, do this as the last quest.  Whenever that may be.  as thematically appropriate as that would be .

 

Can anyone honestly disagree that we would not get raise the shire?

Okay, you had me scared there! I agree an all accounts, including that it will most likely release as the last product (which contributed to my fears).

No.

As in, they would agree that we'll get it at some point.
