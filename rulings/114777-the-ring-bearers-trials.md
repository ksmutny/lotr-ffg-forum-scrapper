Yeah there's got to be something in the 3rd Saga box that let's you bring a dead hero back into your Campaign play probably not limited to only Gandalf as players won't be limited to sacrificing Gandalf either. I think it was in the Team Covenant interview with Caleb and Matt they said the 3rd Saga was all about Aragorn's adventures and the return of Gandalf... so specifically mentioning that definitely sounds like we'll be able to get him back plus it would make no sense not to get him back and would go against the books so I have no doubt we can have an epic Gandalf sacrifice and get him back later :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
