Desperate Alliance reads:

 

>  
> 
> Action: Choose a hero you control. Until the end of the phase, give control of that hero and all resources in that hero's resource pool to another player. (Limit 1 per phase.)

 

 

FAQ 1.51 reads:

 

>  
> 
> When a card with a triggered effect has a limit on the number of times that effect can be triggered (i.e. “Once per round,” “Limit 3 times per phase,” etc.), the limit is specific to that card. However, if a card has a limit of “once per game,” that limitation is specific to the player who triggered it.

 

So what is the limitation on DA preventing me from doing then? The way I understand the FAQ, I can still play three copies of the card if I have them all in my hand. So I guess it is preventing me from doing something like playing DA, getting it back with Dwarven Tomb, then playing it again?

 

This further complicates things. What if I play DA, then Will of the West, then draw and pick up a DA? Is it the same card? I dunno...

> Desperate Alliance (DA): 1. The card gives a limitation of once per phase, and by FAQ 1.51, this seems to apply only to the copy of the card and not the player. a) So if I have multiple DA in my hand can I give away multiple heroes?

> b) Can more than one player play a separate copy of DA in a phase?
> 
> c) If I get back DA from the discard with Dwarven Tomb can I play it again or is it still the same card?
> 
> d) If I play Will of the West and happen to draw DA again in the same phase, can I play it? I cannot be sure if it's the same card unless it's my only copy...

 

> The “limit once per phase” on Desperate Alliance should be treated as “limit 1 Desperate Alliance per phase.” That limit is for all players so that only 1 copy of the event can be played by a player group in a phase.

It looks to me like Caleb's answer was meant to clarify the intent for Desperate Alliance.  Treat it like an errata for that card, so that it reads more like Tighten Our Belts ("only one copy of XXX can be played each round")

 

I don't think that was intended to apply to all "limit X per phase" on all cards with that text.

"only one copy of XXX can be played each phase" I guess.

 

Further, I guess we should consider this for all "Limit X per phase" event cards. So also for Heavy Stroke. I don't see any difference on Desperate Alliance and Heavy Stroke regarding rules.

Neither do I, but i think Caleb's response was directed to just Desperate Alliance. I think we should ask to get some more clarity on these limits as a whole in the faq, perhaps for for every combination of limit X times per (phase/round/game) on (ally/attachment/event), as it seems like the rules vary for each one.
