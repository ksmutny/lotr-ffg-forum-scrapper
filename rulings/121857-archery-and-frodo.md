So this question came up, was playing a game and archery damage was doing its thing, and was wondering if you had say archery 20, could you assign that to frodo and threat up by 20 or are you limited by his HP

 

Also on this similar thinking, assuming you are limited by his HP could i have a song of mocking on frodo, choose a hero with 5 HP and have all the damage move over to frodo, if i did this would frodo take 7 points of damage all to threat, take 2 points to threat then 5 and die, or take 5 to threat, then 2 and die.

 

Put simply mechanically for the purposes of moving and preventing damage, exactly how is archery damage assigned and dealt

You are limited to hp when assigning archery damage, and all archery damage are done after all of them are fully assigned. I got an answer from Caleb.

In case of song of mocking, well... technically, the response of song of mocking is a passive, so frodon would receive all 7 damage before cancelling them BUT, is it considered as only one source ? it is (archery), but I am only 80% sure about that.

Caleb's answer from way back :

> Q: Can a character have more damage than hit point? Can we deal more Archery damage on a character that it has hit points? If there is two Silvan Refugees, can we assign 1 archery damage to both?
> A: Damage from Archery keyword cannot be over-assigned to characters you control. It must be divided among characters you control until either there is no damage left to assign or no characters left to assign it to. The damage is applied simultaneously, so you can assign damage to more than 1 Silvan Refugee because their Forced effect will not trigger until after all the damage has been assigned.

So it is not done 1 by 1.
