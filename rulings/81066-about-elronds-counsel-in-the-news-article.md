It is great that there is a new article [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4029]by Caleb.

However, in the Playing the Deck section, point two says

 * If my threat is getting high, I can play Elrond’s Counsel to simultaneously lower my threat and boost Glorfindel’s Willpower, increasing my chances of questing successfully.

I don't think you can use Elrond's Counsel to boost Glorfindel's Willpower since he is the only unique Noldor character (unless Arwen is in play) and the text reads:

Action: If you control a unique Noldor character, give another character +1[willpower] until the end of the phase……

If my interpretation of this card is correct, the text of the article should probably be clarified by adding that the above can be done only when Arwen is in play.  Is that correct?

If you read the article with some attention, you notice that Caleb says that he uses EC to give Glorfindel a +1 willpower;~.

 

That said, and to meet the conditions on the card EC you need antoher unique noldor in play to be able to give the willpower to Glorfindel. And the other unique noldor in the deck is Arwen.

 

With that, the conclusion taken by Angus Lee is correct and in nowhere it says that you need to give that +1 willpower to another unique noldor.
