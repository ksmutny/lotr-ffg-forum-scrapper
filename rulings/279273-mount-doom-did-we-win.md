The Ring was destroyed the same turn as the player controlling Aragorn threated out.  Any help would be much appreciated!

That does make more sense thematically.  It is also kind of hard to believe that Caleb & co failed to imagine that the Aragorn player could be eliminated the same turn the ring was destroyed.

There have been quite a few threads regarding first player elimination and characters that cause you to lose when they leave play. This was Caleb's response.

I﻿f a player is eliminated while in control of something like The One Ring or an objective-ally with game text that will cause the players to lose if it leaves play, then the players will lose the game because all of the cards under that player's control are immediately removed from the game when he is eliminated.
Cheers,
Caleb

I recommend you not read those threads, though, as they will open a whole other can of worms.

You should submit an official rules query about your Mt. Doom / Black Gate question though, I'd be interested to hear Caleb's ruling on it.
