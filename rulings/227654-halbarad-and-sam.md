I'm surprised nobody has asked this yet, but this seems like an obvious area in need of official clarification.

If you control the Halbarad ally does his ability affect Sam's ability to ready?

Based on the ruling with Caldara and ally Imrahil I have to say that I think it does. First, you engage the enemy, then you activate Sam's response. When checking the game state to verify whether or not Sam readies, the enemy is engaged and thus has 10 higher engagement cost. So, if that extra 10 pushes it above your threat level Sam readies. Am I right?

FYI, I checked with Caleb because I wasn't 100% sure that this worked. Â But, he confirmed that Halbarad ally legally combos with Sam/Pippin because passive effects occur instantly and you check responses after the trigger occurs.
