So, I have been experimenting with decks that work with the victory display and it has given me some troubling thoughts on the game in general. I have had some nagging issues for a while, but this deck really cemented my concerns. I want to know what you guys think.

So, ignoring all the many exceptions, the game generally follows the same pattern. 1. You setup stuff in the staging area etc. 2. You start with nothing but heroes and then play out you cards as quickly as possible. 3. You quest each round and reveal 1 encounter card per player.

So, at the beginning of the game you have: 1. Setup threats in staging area 2. Only heroes and nothing else 3. One encounter card per player during questing.

Later in the game, assuming you survive and even stabalize, you have: 1. Nothing in staging area because setup threats are gone 2. Lots of allies and attachments because you have been playing them out 3. One encounter card per player during questing.

Obviously, the game starts hard and gets easier. It has to because of the basic structure of the mechanics. It would probably be better if the game started easy and got hard, but the game structure is such that the designers must intentionally use the quest itself to make this happen because by default it won't. Now a lot of quests do have ways to make things harder later, but it seems like once a player deck gets setup it just smashes through anything.

Consider the victory display mechanic. When you use "none return" or "leave no trace" you are basically doing nothing, but it is an investment for later. The payoff is "the door is closed" which is, honestly, a borderline broken card. In solo, if you play it successfully your quest phase is a harmless breeze. The encounter deck literally does nothing. If you see it coming with Henamarth Riversong then you can commit everyone to the quest without fear and just smash. I built a deck around this with scroll of isuldur and the weaver to get as many plays of door is closed as possible and after you get setup the quest becomes a joke. Now, it takes a lot to setup so you can lose first, but still, it is very strong.

The main problem with this is the deck is so weak at the beginning that it can't really survive. When the game is hardest you can't do anything, but once the game is easy, then you dominate.

The other problem is that there are dozens of decks like that. Is it any more powerful than dwarves? No. I would say most decks are nearly invincible once they get setup. The thing that makes broken decks broken is not their power level but their SPEED. The Seastan Boromir or Love of Tales decks are not really that much more powerful than dwarf or silvan decks or a Gandalf deck. It is just that they get setup in about 1, 2, or 3 turns. Once they are setup, the rest of the game is a generic algorithm, a formality. The specifics of the story or setting is basically irelavent.

For this reason I am tired of the "one deck to rule them all" style of playing. I would rather have a game system and set of quests that let you take a few rounds to get setup in relative ease, then laI'd the smack down (like the troll ambush at the battle of carrock). I would like it if each quest required a unique deck style to defeat it. Instead, I feel forced to build only one style, a deck that absolutely pukes out allies and attachment in the first 1 or 2 rounds. In the end I don't think the victory display/door is closed deck will work because it doesn't do that.

Don't get me wrong, I still totally love this game. I am not being negative. In fact, I am only saying these things because I hope it can spark thought in a direction that improves the game. I would love to hear your responses.

@Seastan: I recently sent an email to Caleb regarding the Dúnedain issue, mainly asking him whether it was intentional or not to make them so much better in multiplayer (as of yet at least). Still got no answer, but I'll add to the discussion if he replies.

 

Now back on the main topic. In all honesty, since I mostly play solo, I am much more partial to the idea of every archetype or mechanic being viable in solo. I get the idea of balancing the power creep by making it more multiplayer oriented, but on the other hand, imagine being an exclusively solo player with no one else to play, with your favorite group in the books being the rangers of the North, and since the Core set you've been dreaming of playing with Aragorn and Halbarad and whatnot, only to find that the deck is subpar in solo. That would be extremely disappointing, not to mention a waste of money. Thus, I tend to believe that a whole Deluxe and cycle's main mechanic, in this case the Dúnedain, should at least be playable solo, if only to at least cover a larger demographic. Doesn't have to be Dwarves or Silvan; the power level of the deck can be modified according to the player's taste as it is the case in a coop game, but IMO we should at least be able to make a Dúnedain deck and make it work decently in solo against a general variety of quests. Of course this is not the case of obvious multiplayer focused cards like Bard, Brand, Song of Earendil, etc, but making the main group of cards in a whole deluxe and cycle only playable in multiplayer is really disappointing for the solo player, as most of the cards will end up in the binder forever. Now as for the other themes in the cycle, I've tried the Rossiel deck and it works fine in solo, and I didn't even go with secrecy. The Noldor I still haven't played, but they're shaping up like a well rounded and generally powerful trait, so I'm excited to play them.

> I feel like they originally designed the game (whether intentionally or not) to favor solo. Now they are correcting that, making the game more coop strong (which they should). Therefore the reason that Dunedain is strong in multiplayer is because of timing, not flavor. That is unfortunate.

 

I'm curious to know why you feel that way. Looking at the first cycle, I would've said the opposite.

 

PtM: Fixed setup regardless of the number of players.

JatA: 1 extra encounter card/turn favors 2 players.

EfDG: 1 captive out of 6 is better than 1 out of 3.

THfG: 1 extra encounter card/turn favors 2 players.

CatC: Dealing with a fixed amount of big trolls gets easier with each additional player.

AJtR: Revealing more cards from the encounter deck makes finding athelas easier.

THoEM: Possibly the one quest that is easier solo due to the nature of location lock.

TDM: Neutral

RtM: Favors multiplayer to such an extent that solo is almost impossible.

 

As for the flavor or theme of the stealthy Dunedain teaming up with others and getting up in the face of as many enemies as possible, I agree with you - it's a little strange. But I think I can sort of understand what they were going for. Here's what Caleb said about the Dunedain theme when the Lost Realm was first anounced:

 

>

>  
> 
> The Dúnedain theme in The Lost Realm was inspired by the passage from The Fellowship of the Ring in which Aragorn explains to Boromir how the Rangers of the North have long protected the free peoples of Middle-earth.These Rangers were the greatest hunters of their time, and their constant vigilance drives the majority of the expansion’s player cards.

 

I interpret this as an inherent multiplayer focus. If the point is to engage lots of enemies in order to prevent them from attacking someone else, there needs to be a "someone else".
