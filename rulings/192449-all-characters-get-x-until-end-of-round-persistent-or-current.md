# [All Characters Get x Until End of Round (persistent or current?)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192449-all-characters-get-x-until-end-of-round-persistent-or-current/)

## 1 [isthar on October 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192449-all-characters-get-x-until-end-of-round-persistent-or-current/?do=findComment&comment=1871437)

For cards like this...

 

"All characters get -1 willpower until the end of the round"

 

I believe this strictly means

 

"All characters in play right at this moment get -1 willpower until the end of the round. Characters that come and go later during this round are not affected."

 

Is that correct? Is their evidence showing this in one way or another?

Even characters that enter play later in the round will be affected.

 

For my reasoning, check out this card:

And this clarification from Caleb:

 

>  
>

> 
> Treacherous Fog : [...] Even if there are no locations in the staging area at the time Treacherous Fog is revealed, locations will still get +1 threat strength until the end of the phase. That means if a location is added to the staging area after Treacherous Fog is revealed, it will get +1 threat until the end of the phase. [...]

I was just about to reply with the same thing...

 

However, does this also mean Lay of Nimrodel, Blood of Numenor, and Gondorian Fire do not work the way we expected?  Is there a significant difference between the two situations.  None of the 3 player cards listed say "gets +1 X for each resource 'currently'..."

 

EDIT: I just found the answer to my own question in these forums:

 

> Official response:
> 
> Blood of Numenor is a triggered effect that lasts until the end of the phase. The additional defense it provides is based on the number of resources in the attached hero's resource pool at the time it is triggered. So, if Aragorn had 5 resources in his pool when you triggered Blood of Numenor, he would get +4 defense until the end of the phase. If you paid 2 more resources from his pool to play For Gondor! after that, he would still have +4 defense from Blood of Numenor.

So, a different question remains - do we have an explanation as to why these two interactions (player cards like Blood of Numenor versus treacheries like Treacherous Fog) are different?

Here is an old ruling about Blood of Numenor:

 

"Blood of Numenor is a triggered effect that lasts until the end of the phase. The additional defense it provides is based on the number of resources in the attached hero's resource pool at the time it is triggered. So, if Aragorn had 5 resources in his pool when you triggered Blood of Numenor, he would get +4 defense until the end of the phase. If you paid 2 more resources from his pool to play For Gondor! after that, he would still have +4 defense from Blood of Numenor.

Cheers,

Caleb"

 

From the thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80004-blood-of-numenor/?hl=numenor].  

 

Now, how are Blood of Numenor and, say, Treacherous Fog different?  I can venture a guess.

 

Blood of Numenor:

Attach to a Gondor or Dúnedain hero. Action: Spend 1 resource from attached hero's resource pool to give attached hero +1 Defense for each resource in its resource pool until the end of the phase. (Limit once per phase.)

 

Gondorian Fire:

Attach to a Gondor or Dúnedain hero. Action: Spend 1 resource from attached hero's resource pool to give attached hero +1 Attack for each resource in its resource pool until the end of the phase. (Limit once per phase.)

 

Lay of Nimrodel:

Action: Choose a Spirit hero. Until the end of the phase, that hero gets +1 Willpower for each resource in its resource pool.

 

Treacherous Fog:

When Revealed: Each location in the staging area gets +1 Threat until the end of the phase. Then, each player with a threat of 35 or higher chooses and discards 1 card from his hand.

 

-----

 

OK grammar nerd time!

 

BoN and GF use the infinitive "give" which is perhaps used here to denote a one-time effect.  Per the ruling above, the amount of defense/attack is calculated at the time that you trigger the effect, and doesn't change if the number of resources in your resource pool changes.

 

Treacherous Fog uses the simple present "gets."  Per the ruling, this is a lasting effect and will impact other cards coming into play.  Present tense is often used to describe 'habitual' actions that are not one-time occurrences ("He goes to the library every week," or "I give my proceeds to charity" [compare: "Give your proceeds to charity."])

 

That's really shaky though.  And in that interpretation, Lay of Nimrodel would actually function like Treacherous Fog.  Alternative explanation: there's an unspoken rule that cards using the resource pool as a basis for calculation never do re-calculations if the pool changes!

I was just asking Caleb about Lay of Nimrodel, and now he's saying that Blood of Numenor/Gondorian Fire/Lay of Nimrodel all are phase long effects that work similar to passive effects and get recalculated as needed. I'm going to show him the prior ruling, I'll post what I learn!

Ignore the part where Caleb yells at me, but here it is guys. New ruling for all of these cards.

 

When I asked if you had any prior rulings that you were referencing, this is what I was asking for. My current ruling does indeed contradict this previous one, but my current ruling is the correct one. We long ago established that encounter card effects that last until “the end of the phase” or “end of the round” must be recalculated when the board state changes, so it follows that it must be true for player card effects as well.

Thanks for getting an official ruling.  I think this makes everything a lot more consistent which rests well with my mind.  No more nightmares (except Nightmare scenarios of course) about how to resolve Lay of Nimrodel.

Yikes. I mean I have 200+ games so I hate when I ask an 'obvious' question... and then some new ruling kinda thing comes out .. oops.

 

So... all these things are lasting effects... okay.

 

I have to say, do not conclude that the player cards we are talking about are affected though.

 

Take Blood of Numenor:

"Attach to a Gondor or Dúnedain hero. Action: Spend 1 resource from attached hero's resource pool to give attached hero +1 Defense for each resource in its resource pool until the end of the phase. (Limit once per phase.)"

 

Okay. When you spend one resourec, you give that hero (he has already a defense value of D) +1d*(resources-now-in-pool). That can't be a lasting thing. It didn't say "Spend 1 resource to give attached Hero the following text: "+1 defense for each..."". 

 

... or is Caleb's "it must follow for player cards" really thought out and all these wordings are now to be interpreted as a "lasting effect"?

 

For clarity, the card I was referring to is http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Murmurs-of-Dread-TSoE [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Murmurs-of-Dread-TSoE]

 

(Murmurs-of-Dread.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Stone-of-Erech/Murmurs-of-Dread.png]

 

I can see how most readings of that card would agree with "Oh sure, if that's a lasting effect.. I get it." But it isn't "give" or "get"... which truly reads like a one time thing!
