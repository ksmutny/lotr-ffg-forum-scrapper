Drew this enemy card...

And the card from the top of my deck was a trap. Is it considered attached to him as a trap? Or I have to defeat him first, then I can play it later as a trap?

Well, at the time, Caleb had actually already taken over as lead developer ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]  I was behind on products (still am). 

Yeah, it's weird that whatever Hobgoblin guards doesn't count as an attachment, even though it technically is by the wording, but I guess that's just how it is.
