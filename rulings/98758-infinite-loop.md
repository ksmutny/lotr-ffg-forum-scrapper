# [Infinite Loop?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/)

Situation: Three player game, Journey Down the Anduin, Thalin (one of the heroes on the table).

 

Games progresses along, going through the encounter deck and deal with the Eastern Crows as they come up.  Deck gets down to three cards, which are the crows.  Staging portion of the quest begins, first crow hits the table, surge kicks off, then Thalin's response kicks off killing the crow, shuffles back into the deck.  Then we deal with the next crow because of the surge then go through the same sequence. 

 

We didn't know what to do, so we shuffled the discards back into the deck.  My question is, does Thalin's effect take precedence over the surge effect, or is it the other way.  Or, does surge kick off on each crow, then resolve Thalin's response, thus killing all the crows, which are shuffled back into the deck, which would be just those three cards, ending the potential of a loop?

Seem to recall a very old ruling stating that the crow does not get shuffled back but seems that is outdated now. Anyways I asked Caleb so we can get closure on it:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Thalin destroys Eastern Crows after it is revealed from the encounter deck, it will trigger its Forced effect and get shuffled back into the encounter deck. If it was the last card in the encounter deck, then it will be placed back as the only card in the encounter deck.
Cheers,
Caleb

I got a reply form Caleb.. witch is the EXACT opposite form the one I got from Nate a few years ago. This is the 4th rule that they have completely reversed on me. Not even the designers know what the hell they are talkign about.

 

Rule Question:
Thalin + Eastern Crows..

In the FAQ it says that the card is destroyed before the keywords (like surge) resolve.

Doesn't this also mean the response text can not resolve either and when a crow is killed by Thalin during the staging step of the ques phase it is not shuffled into the encounter deck, but instead goes into the discard pile?

Thanks.

 

 

Hi,
The text on the Eastern Crow will still resolve after Thalin destroys it, which will shuffle it back into the encounter deck.
Cheers,
Caleb

I also put in a question about this card, as logic has nothing to do with this game.. who the **** knows?

That is because the designers changed from Nate to Caleb.. and Caleb has ruled a different 3ay to the way it was originally rulled.
