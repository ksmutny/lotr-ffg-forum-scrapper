Can you use Beorn with the Trap card Ambush?

 

Ambush has the text "Combat Action: The engaged player discards Ambush to declare an attack against the attached enemy."

 

I want to say "yes," as the card doesn't target a hero, just sets up a framework effect.  But I'm not too sure.  By contrast, Quick Strike has you "exhaust a hero" as part of its cost.

 

Immune cards "ignore the effects of player cards," so probably Beorn would just have to ignore that attack.  Thoughts?

And the answer:

 

 

"Yes, Beorn can be declared as an attacker with Ambush. The ability on Ambush allows you (the player) to make an attack against the attached enemy. Once the attack is initiated, it resolves like a normal attack, which Beorn can participate in. 
The type of attack that Beorn could not participate in, would be an attack initiated by Quick Strike. That’s because Quick Strike instructs you to exhaust a character you control in order to declare that character as an attacker. Beorn’s immunity would prevent you from targeting him with that effect.
