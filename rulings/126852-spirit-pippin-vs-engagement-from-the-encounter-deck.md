Spirit Pippin's ability reads:

 

------------

"If each hero you control has the Hobbit trait, Pippin gains: 'Response: After an enemy engages you, raise your threat by 3 to return it to the staging area. Until the end of the round, that enemy cannot engage you.'"

-------------

 

 

How about when an enemy engages you directly from the encounter deck or discard pile?  Examples like the ones copied below.  Since Pippin's ability says "return" it to the staging area, I'm guessing you cannot do this (how can you return an enemy to the staging area if it was never there in the first place?).  However, I really want his ability to be more useful than it is :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Answer:

 

Yes, an effect that returns an enemy to the staging area will work on an enemy that engaged you from some other place (the encounter deck, discard pile, out of play, etc).
Kudos for playing an all Hobbit deck with spirit Pippin!

Yay, that means he is viable for avoiding Wights in Barrows... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
