I had a situation in two-handed solo earlier where one of my "players" was eliminated via hero death. That player had two eagles on the table, and the live player had an Eagles of the Misty Mountains out.

 

Recall: EoMM's Response text is "After another Eagle character leaves play, you may attach that card facedown to Eagles of the Misty Mountains."

 

So can those two eagles from the eliminated player be attached to the EoMM (since they are "leaving play"?), or do all cards of an eliminated player automatically cease interacting with the game immediately?

 

(Consider https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/7608788#7608788 [https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/7608788#7608788)] )

 

Similarly (...or is it...), do all the heroes/allies from an eliminated player trigger the Horn of Gondor for an active player? I've seen a couple of old threads about this precise question, but I wasn't sure if it had ever been officially answered.

Just to point out: Horn of Gondor has been errata'ed since this question, so that part no longer applies (the eliminated player's characters aren't "destroyed"). Re: Eagles of the Misty Mountains, the ruling here...

...would seem to indicate that the eliminated player's Eagles are removed from the game immediately and thus cannot be attached to EoMM.

This also jibes with a separate question I once asked of Caleb: can you Stand and Fight allies from an eliminated player's discard pile? The answer is no -- said allies have been removed from the game.

Since the game rules explicitly state that an eliminated player's cards go straight to their owner's discard pile, and nothing in the FAQ contradicts this, I'm not sure where Caleb got this ruling from.
