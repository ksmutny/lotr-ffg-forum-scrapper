What does X means on the cards? The amount of resources you decide to pay ? And what else?

The rest is good, but the boldfaced part is untrue, no? Like when you Vilya a Stand and Fight off the top of the deck: it doesn't mean you can put into play a 6-cost Beorn in your discard pile.

FAQ 1.40: 'Unless specified by a card effect, or granted player choice, the letter "X" is equal to 0.'

EDIT: The RR has a new additional clause: 'For costs involving the letter X, the value of X is defined by card ability or player choice, after which the amount paid may be modified by effects without altering the functional value of X.'

So what @Rouxxor [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/308704-rouxxor/] said is a little more true than I said, specifically in the X cost situation. I don't think this changes the Vilya/Stand and Fight interaction, though, as Vilya ignores costs entirely—this doesn't give you a chance to choose X at all, thus defaulting it to 0.

Interestingly enough, the new RR clause also helps to cover something like Hail of Stones, which says "Exhaust X characters to…" Even though X is not explicitly "granted player choice" in the card text, the clause is a cost involving X and therefore covered by the RR addition. Good job, Caleb!
