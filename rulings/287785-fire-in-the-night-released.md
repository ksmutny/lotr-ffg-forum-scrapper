First, you don't want to be including your own side quests in this adventure.  Dagnir gives you no time and Caleb gives you plenty of side quests.  That said, I like Gather info, Double Back & Scout Ahead best.  I hope that we get more player side quests in the next cycle... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Thanks.  I was not thinking to this quest specially but to general terms.
