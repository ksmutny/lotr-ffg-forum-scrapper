I made a big document with relevant questions & answers that doesn't appear in the 1.7 faq and here's the result.

Feel free to give feedback and point out questions I could have missed.

It contains a lot of questions our french community asked and were never translated to english until now.

New update with 20 new entries.

 * Deleted duplicate entries with the official faq.
 * Added old questions I missed since the beggining.

As some are from the french forum I'll start putting them here in spoiler for those you already follow BGG and this forum :


- when engaging Zealous Traitor with Hammer Stroke you didn't optionnaly engaged him
- when a card gain surge in his when revealed effect, you can use Minas Tirith Lampwright
- when revealing a card from your deck with Hunter of Lamedon, it is still in your deck and it would proc hidden cache.
- when using saruman, the cards is considered out of play, but also everything attach to it.

 

The printable version is a up to date as it is a google doc, the pdf will be updated tonight (GMT+1, in 5 hours).

 

Are there other communities / forums that are asking questions to Caleb and are not visible here ?
