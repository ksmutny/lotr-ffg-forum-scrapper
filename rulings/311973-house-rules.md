I was just wondering if anyone else uses any "house rules" when playing?

For instance, making hero Bilbo only cost six instead of nine or changing the cost of older allies to align with newer ones.

Or not just stuff to make it easier but things like no Steward of Gondor or other powerful cards when deckbuilding.

Due to the terrible jumble the Setup rules are after some of the latest rulings from Caleb we are playing the Setup in a more straightforward way.

We oftentimes not care about following the players' order in the planning phase (in a 4 players fellowship) when everyone is simply playing stuff on their own character, we simply usually play all at once to speed up the play time. Of course if there are cross table plays we strive to respect the proper order.

When I play solo I often make decks with some restrictions (thematic or mechanic) to better enjoy different games, but I would not consider it an "house rule".

We use (or not) the sneak errata seen in some of the latest reprintings based on common (dis)approval of the errata. For example we play A Burning Brand as restricted and having to exhaust it, Legacy of Durin has needing to exhaust it, but still play Thror's Map as after the 1st official errata.

Yeah, like asgardianphil, I'm pretty anal where victories are concerned. If I have even the slightest doubt, I'll play the quest again until I feel I played it 100% correctly (which can be a dangerous and maddening obsession). I have the FAQ and rules reference at hand, and if those don't answer my questions, I'll search for answers online (ideally official replies from Caleb).

That said, I have not incorporated the "sneak errata" made to A Burning Brand, etc., since they are not on my printed cards and are not referenced in an official FAQ document. 

Someday I will lift my self-imposed "progression" restriction--after I have beaten every quest in the game one- and two-handed.

I play the errata as-is for the most part, but there are a couple of house rules I use to reverse rulings that were, IMHO, mistaken and/or to fix cards where the card text failed to capture the card's obvious intent.

One such card is Hands Upon the Bow. It requires a character with ranged, and is very similar to the effect of Great Yew Bow. But where Great Yew Bow expliticly states that the attack it enables is a ranged attack, Hands Upon the Bow does not, and Caleb has ruled that based on the card text, Hands Upon the Bow does not count as a ranged attack. So it won't trigger Bard the Bowman's effect, or the effect of Rivendell Bow. I find that to be an odd decision on Caleb's part, when clearly the right decision would have been to errata Hands Upon the Bow to say "This attack counts as a ranged attack".

I also don't like that the original printed rules contain the sentence "Any player can take actions generally, or between the game steps stated in the rules" for steps listed in green, but the more detailed action sequence printed in the online rules reference does not contain those action windows that the original printed rules granted. Yet no errata ever mentions this fact, so it's unclear whether this was intentional. This came up in the "Westfold Outrider in Solo" topic (linked below), where someone asked whether Westfold Outrider could be discarded between the enemy attacks step of the Combat phase and the player attacks step. Going by the online rules reference, the answer would seem to be no, because they stealth-erratad the action window that used to exist between those two steps. But that leads to an unintuitive conclusion, where you can use Westfold Outrider to lure enemies into an ambush if you have an enemy already engaged with you (because then you have an action window while you're resolving your attack against the first enemy), but you can't do so if you have nobody already engaged with you (because the Player Attack Resolution sequence is the only place action windows are found in the online rules reference, and that doesn't open for you until after you have declared at least one attack, which means you must have an eligible attacker & enemy to declare against). This is counterintuitive and weird, so I house rule that there are action windows in between the game steps stated in the online rules reference, just as the original printed rules stated. This smooths out a lot of card interactions and makes them make sense.

Oh and I also follow the Setup phase house rules that other people have mentioned. They basically boil down to "Just do what actually makes sense when the card's intent is clear, rather than following RAW when that would lead to a result that makes no sense." E.g., when using Messenger of the King, you can put your ally-turned-hero into play before drawing your initial hand of 6 cards. (RAW says draw first, then follow setup rules). Otherwise it might happen that you draw your intended ally in your first six cards, he/she is unavailable for the contract's purposes, and the entire design of your deck (especially resource balance between your spheres) is broken. That's no fun, and is not the way the contract was intended to work. So I agree with the house rules that other people mentioned, where you follow the way the Setup phase clearly should work instead of the confusing and unintuitive mess that we have now with current rulings.

Sometimes I play with the updated cards from the Ancient Mathoms project, which are basically community positive errata to old/underpowered cards (except for a few nerfs), but I don't do that exclusively.

Other than that, the only house rules I play with are the Setup ones - which are basically do what makes sense with the player setup card. I use all erratas - even the most recent ones; from the most recent interview with Caleb, they are official erratas, he has just been way too busy to actually write the FAQ. So they are official, they will be on a rules sheet. So I use them, even the annoying ones.
