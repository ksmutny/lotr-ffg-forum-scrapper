I recently posted in this thread http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106418-cool-idea-for-the-next-cycle/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106418-cool-idea-for-the-next-cycle/] a comment about how I would like to see more of the "good" sites in Middle earth like Rivendell, Lorien, Edoras, etc While there are present in the story, we never are really there in the game. And I know some will say that "what why would you like to visit Rivendell, it's so boring" and yeah you won't find any combat there but I believe that in the Lord of the Rings story and all that, the good "capitals" of the free peoples are as important as the dangerous places the encounter deck throws at us. They are places of information, counsel and healing, among other things.

 

So if you guys would be interested of seeing this in the game, I designed a little mechanic about it; it just occured to me so I don't know whether I like it or not yet, but here it goes: Being able to play an "alternate company" in a static place outside the reach of enemies, a Refuge, like say, Rivendell. And you place those allies there, are still affected by treacheries and by other effects (or maybe they become immune to player card effects), but do not combat (and do not also quest? hmmm) and you can use their activated abilities, but nothing more. So here you basically play allies like Imladris Stargazer, yeah you can't use her for chumpblocking if she's in Rivendell, but at least you can use her ability as many times you want. Maybe even Faramir, so you can use his ability yet doesnt participate in combat. Zigil Miner for those "Aule" decks. I don't know, it seems like it opens plenty of options. I'd be willing to create a house rule based on it to test it.

 

I think the restrictions I mentioned above (cannot quest, immune to player cards) are dependant on the site they're played on (so in Lorien for example they can quest but cannot use their abilities). Also, there should be a limit of how many characters you can put in the refuge. I guess Rivendell would be the highest, at 5? the rest between 2 or 3.

 

Btw only one refuge can be in play under the control of one player. Should one be able to play allies in other player's refuge? hmm

 

Anyway what do you think?

Thanks for the suggestions shipwreck, but I'll have to be honest. They're too complicated. First, the idea of Haven X and the haven tokens is a bit too much IMO. And why would Havens contribute threat and have to be explored? To me it just sounds like an unnecesary, over-complicated version of location cards, although balanced. The idea is for this to be a completely new player card type, where you can keep allies and use their abilities. Nothing more.

 

Why would having them in the player area threaten the basics of the game? They are unaffected by anything, as well as the allies inside. 

 

@Ana: You'll have to stretch your thematic mind a bit to get it. While it's not obvious that it makes sense for Faramir to boost willpower from Minas Tirith, it does work when you think he was in a position of power and all his people loved him, whether he was present or not, and thus their willpower is boosted. Maybe I'm sounding a bit like Caleb in the last second breakfast article, but never doubt that is was an idea I had from the start, and one of my main goals, to be able to make Faramir boost willpower from the Haven, just like Zigil Miner mining in Erebor, Erestor giving counsel, etc. Also, I wrote in the haven thread a new restriction. You can use the special ability of only one ally in a Haven per turn.
