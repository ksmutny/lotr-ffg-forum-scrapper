Sometimes it's just nice to have a place to share your battle reports.  What are you all doing recently?  Feel free to use this thread to post whatever recent quest experience you want.

 

*      *      *

 

To celebrate the impending release of the next installment of The Hobbit, we decided to go back and play through all of the Hobbit quests with thematically appropriate decks.  This means no Dain, which makes dwarf decks more challenging to play against these quests.  We've got Oin, Ori and Bombur one end, with Thorin, Balin and Nori on the other, and all of the other dwarves represented as allies.  The only thematic break we made was for functional purposes, putting Wardens of Healing into one deck and Imladris Stargazers into the other.  Otherwise everything is a dwarf or Gandalf.

 

We played We Must Away 6 times before we managed to get the treasure, and had 4 losses in there due to Bilbo getting sacked or just miscalculating and getting to stage 3 too early.

 

Had some bad luck with Over the Misty Mountains Grim and the crazy Galloping Boulders / Suspicious Crow combo, and took us 4 attempts to win at this one.  

 

Then did Dungeons Deep tonight, first attempt lost quickly when Bilbo failed 2 riddles in the first round.  Second attempt we won, and it was a very satisfying victory, with 2 damage on Bilbo, dramatic riddle card reveals, and in the last round winning by questing with *exactly* enough willpower needed to clear the quest card.  Still one of my favorite quests, that one.

You are right, it is not in the FAQ, my mistake.  I actually got clarification from Caleb and assumed this was in the FAQ.

 

I thought this was a valid move, so went ahead and designed a deck around it.  And my memory of past discussions of card immunity was that Hands Upon the Bow would work.  When I sent my question to Caleb, I was actually asking a different question.  I asked whether Bolg would need to be defeated a 2nd time in order to satisfy the victory criterion once the players reached stage 5. 

 

Caleb's reply (and I deleted it-- really wish I had kept it, now) was that the Hands Upon the Bow ruling had been changed, and that card cannot be used to attack immune enemies, so there would be no way to defeat Bolg before stage 5, anyway.  I would assume this applies to Quick Strike as well, since it is similarly worded.  The FAQ has not been updated since July, so perhaps we will see an official reversal whenever the next update takes place...

ah I see, Cool :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. It makes sense that you should not be able to engage the likes of Bolg until you get to the right stage in the quest etc... pity that 'Hands upon the Bow' won't work on immune enemies period :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] though. Would have preferred it if 'boss' type enemies were protected till their grand entrance and then game on.

 

What a confusing mini saga 'Hands upon the Bow', 'Quick Strike', 'Dunhere's Abilty'  etc vs immune to player cards has been. With the various rulings and subsequent ruling changes.

 

Do you think that 'Forth Eorlingas!' will be in or out? "Combat Action: Each Rohan hero can be declared as an attacker against enemies in the staging area this phase."  I'm assuming out like 'Hands.. ' but this makes 'Quick Strike' inclusion look a bit inconsistent. I guess its simply less potentially quest breaking.

Matt or Caleb said in an email that "once per game" effects are on a per player basis so the combo mentioned above is legal. It seems a little OP and I wouldn't be surprised if his gets errataed somewhere down the road.
