To date, every Adventure Pack has included 8-10 (usually 9) new player cards, plus a new hero. As the game grows, the number of possible decks has exploded, to the point where the addition of just one new card sometimes opens up a new deck archetype, usually with multiple variations (e.g., Strider, Sword-Thain, Elven Light, Gather Information). And nearly every hero opens up a new deck archetype.

 

I would almost rather see just a few player cards published each cycle (say, 8 in a deluxe and 2 in each adventure pack), especially if those player cards that did get published were of the calibre of the examples I gave above. The adventure packs themselves might start to include two quests instead of just one, or to include encounter card setups that make use of the larger number of cards. Heck, maybe they'd start to publish the nightmare decks simultaneously and include them in the adventure pack!

 

I'm not even sure this change would decrease sales of the game - I enjoy playing the new quests, especially because I'm interested in seeing what new ways the designers have come up with to challenge us or to smash powerful deck archetypes. And, if the player cards were as game-changing as some of the examples I gave above, I certainly wouldn't mind. As it is, only about half of the player cards that I get these days actually make it into decks. Partly this is because of a lack of time on my part, and partly because some of the player cards are very conditional and require careful deck-building (Master Ironsmith, Guarded Ceaselessly, Arrows from the Trees, Scouting Party).

 

But I digress. My original query was: would you balk if FFG published fewer player cards?

Sadly we know Caleb said that we're not getting any player-card only products ever, as the whole game revolves around playing against a quest so if we didn't get a quest we would have nothing to play against. I personally woud love some player card only products but it's unlikely. The best thing we can hope for IMO is another parallel series after the Saga expansions end, maybe saga packs as has been suggested with events like the Battle of Dale and other War of the Ring events. I would love to have this, or something like a new series.

 

On the other hand, I would also be ok if we just got more payer cards in regular expansions.

I was thinking it'd be nice to have some Saga expansions delve deeper into Middle Earth's history.  It'd be pretty much impossible to get permission to use anything from the Silmarillion, but there are other historic events which could be fun.  The top two on my list would be the Battle of Fornost (with Hobbit Archers!) and the Battle of Greenfields (with a Bullroarer Took hero).

Dude, we barely get enough player cards as it is. I would be extremely disappointed with getting less then we are already getting. I would be in favor of more player cards per pack. Hell, I wouldn't mind a 99% payer card pack that comes with a very small encounter deck that consists of 2 cards (Caleb did say no player card only packs, so this should work), one saying you lose, the other you win. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

What happens in a multiplayer game, where you have to reveal more than one card?

Sounds like a fun design challenge, though. Design a quest that uses the smallest number of cards possible, while still remaining fun.

> You cannot compare the number of player cards form a pack of LOTR and Netrunner because they both have different playstyles. As you know Netrunner and all the other competitive LCGs have only player cards. So it's normal that each pack provides more player cards than a LOTR pack does. The question is .. do we get enough player cards per pack/expansion?

well, i mean i did, but that wasn't really the point i was making.

the salient point is: more player cards would be preferable, not less.

think of how many underdeveloped themes and traits there are: there are only 5 Dale cards. only 1 Esgaroth.

Rohan has been pretty fleshed out as far as Spirit goes, and it's gotten a bit more support in Leadership and Tactics recently, but there are only 2 Lore Rohan cards.

we've just now got some great support for Scout, but i think it could use a bit more.

starting in this cycle, we've got some support for multisphere decks as well as more support for mutliplayer, with 'any player may activate this ability' on a lot of cards

last cycle we got side quests, and we'll get more in the next cycle.

point is, as i said, i'd rather see more of these things, not less.

yeah, i'm not actually surprised. i'm fine with the status quo as it is. would be happy to see more, but definitely would not be happy to see less.

Game's over after one pull. You either win or lose, no need to draw another card. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
