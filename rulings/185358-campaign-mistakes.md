Has anyone else been running a campaign, and then realised several quests in that they maybe made mistakes with their boon choices? I'm playing a pseudo-ironman campaign (in which I have to keep my first success against each quest - if it was just until I failed a quest, I'd be done at Journey in the Dark), and I realised too late that I should have put the boon for +1 willpower and Noble onto Gandalf, so that he could rock Anduril, and quest for 5. Instead it's sitting on Glorfindel, which is still cool, but it's a bit late now to change it (I'm 6 quests in).

 

Also, out of interest, do people tend to play for the resurrection boon after rescuing the captives, or the other boons (if they have a choice)?

 

That said, I'm enjoying finally doing a campaign for the first time properly, and have found that I really like the new Theoden, who I've had in a team with Galadriel and Eomer since the start. They're a fun team together, since you get lots of cheap Rohan allies into play, who can quest then chump-block/discard for effects, fueling Eomer to kill everything. And this play through has made me appreciate the Hama ally a lot. As a last resort defender he is impressive. I wish I'd put the time into a campaign sooner, because it is awesome!

> I actually don't think Permanent Boons are lost if you just switch the hero out. The only text I see that instructs you to remove a Permanent Boon from the Campaign Pool is when the attached hero is added to the Fallen Heroes list.



 

You're right. The Boons still are in the Campaign Pool, but you don't get to reassign them to another hero. If you bring back the hero from the dead (for example with the "Beyond all hope" Boon, the permanent Boons of that hero are back too!

 

Same case when you get to Treason of Saruman. Every previous Boon you had attached to regular Aragorn being transfer to the Fellowship Aragorn. If you have Aragorn in your list of Fallen Heroes, same case, you bring him back with +1 threat penalty and he comes back with all of its boons.

 

Caleb Grace about that (asked him by mail a couple of months when coding the Campaign log):

 

> If you remove a hero from the list of fallen heroes with Beyond All Hope, each permanent attachment that was attached to that hero in the campaign log is still attached to that hero.

 

Nickpes, another of your question:

> IIRC, only on The Ring Goes South it is stated that you can shuffle none earned boon cards on your deck, so after that quest, if i.e. I choose Sting (is solo one hand) i will not use Anduril or Mithril shirt again shuffled on my deck and they will be "discarded" from campaign, so that in solo only one of these could be used on the whole campaign. Is this the case?

 

You're right, only in The Rings Goes South you get to put a Boon into your hand (Mithril Shirt, Anduril, Glamdring or Dard) and the other are shuffled. But whatever you do, the Boons have been earned and are part of your Campaign Pool. If you don't choose to use them in the following scenarios, the Boons remain in your Campaign Pool.

 

Say at the start of Journey in the Dark, before you draw your starting hand, you can shuffle any non-permanent Boon in anyone's deck (but you don't have to). So it is possible you get one of the Boons in your opening hand (but beware it dilutes your deck as Boons do not count towards the 50-card limit).

 

Be aware that the setup timing for encounter cards of the Campaign is a little awkward as The Black Riders Booklet says you add those (Burdens or Boons with an encounter card back) to the encounter deck after drawing initial hand. I asked Caleb about it and that's his answer:

>  
> 
> The Black Riders booklet implies that cards with the Setup instruction are setup before drawing the first hand.
> 
>  
> What about other Boons and Burdens that shuffles into the encounter deck or adds to a player's hand?
>  
> From what I understood reading TBR rules:
>  * Permanent Boons and Burdens are added "at the start of the game" so I guess it's only after step 7 of setup, but I guess it doesn't hurt to attach them during step 3 (place heroes and set initial threat levels)?
>  * Boons with an encounter card back are shuffled into the encounter deck "when setting up the game", when, exactly? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
>  * "When setting up future scenarios in the current campaign, the players may include any boon cards as recorded in the Campaign Pool in their decks." => so when do I include cards like Anduril, Mithril Shirt? After or Before drawing my initial hand?
>  * Encounter cards with a player card back are shuffled into one's deck after the drawing of initial hand.
> 
> This is kind of important, because I may well have to shuffle Ho! Tom Bombadil! into my deck if I decide to take a mulligan for example. Also, if Boons are shuffled after drawing initial hand, I can't get them in my opening hand.

 Answer by Caleb:

 

> You are correct that players technically draw their starting hand before resolving Setup effects. The burden card, Gandalf’s Delay, has a weird timing issue as a result. We have not issued an errata for the card because we found that most players intuitively understood how the effect was meant to be resolved. Gandalf’s Delay is meant to reduce the number of cards in your starting hand by 1. 
> 
> When playing campaign mode, boons that you have earned are considered part of your deck before you even set up the game. So it is possible to draw boons in your opening hand.
> 
>  
> Burden cards with both encounter and player card backs are considered part of the encounter deck and do not get shuffled in until you build the encounter deck (which comes after building your player deck and choosing your heroes). So it is not possible to draw a burden card with a player back into your opening hand.
> Glad you’re enjoying the saga expansions!

Funny note: if you strictly follow the rules and setup timing, the Burden card Gandalf's Delay does nothing ^^

 

Back on player cards, a reminder about Setup instruction rules (from Treason of Saruman booklet):

 

> If a player card with Setup instructions is in a player’s deck at the beginning of a game, that player searches his deck for that card and follows its instructions before drawing his first hand. Similarly, if a burden card with Setup is in the encounter deck at the beginning of a game, search the encounter deck for that card and follow its instructions before resolving the Setup instructions on the quest.

 

So to sum up a bit, I think the most logical setup timing is this one:

- Permanent Boons are attached to a specific hero and remain attached to that hero, even if you change heroes or if the hero has fallen.

- Non-permanent Boons in your Campaign Pool can be shuffled in your deck before drawing your initial hand.

- Then, you resolve Setup instructions on Boons.

- Then you draw your initial hand.

 

Which I think in the grand scheme of things is (the 7 step of setup are taken from the rule book). I put in blue the Campaign setup instructions.

On a final side note: you could definitely include a Permanent Boon belonging to a Fallen Hero to your deck during step 1. Then, what happens to this Boon during Step 3. b) I don't know, I think it gets discarded. (Discarding or adding a Boon to the Victory Display does not remove the Boon from the Campaign Pool, so I guess it's safe).
