"Players do not raise their threat at the end of the refresh phase."

But, we don't normally raise our threat at the end of the refresh phase do we? The core rulebook says that raising our threat occurs during the refresh phase, and shows a player action window between raising our threat and the end of the phase. So according to the rules, the first line on Barad-dur doesn't actually do anything. We should all still be raising our threat by 1 each turn on top of the +X threat from the Forced effect.
