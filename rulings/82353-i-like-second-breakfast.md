I just want to show my support to Caleb and ffg for making the Second Breakfast periodic. I think it is nice of you to share thoughts behind deck-building, and I am especially looking forward to decks with the upcoming player cards. I have run similar decks to those previewed, especially the Rohan deck, so it is great to compare with one of the designers. I think it is safe to say I am among many whose anticipation for the Against the Shadow cycle is great, and the packs cannot begin coming our way soon enough. Keep up the wonderful game!

I agree.  Hats off to Caleb, and FFG in general, for the high level of engagement they maintain with the player community.

As a side note, I really like the strategy of keeping threat low and stealthily killing enemies in the staging area.  I'm really glad to see the game's designer does as well!
