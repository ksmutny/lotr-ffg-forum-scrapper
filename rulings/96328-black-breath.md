Treachery card reads:

When Revealed: Attach to a hero you control.

(Counts as a Condition attachment with the text:

"Limit1 per hero. Reduce attached hero´s [Willpower), [Attack]

and [Defense] to 0." 

 

My question here is wether this reduction goes for the hero´s basic abilities or also for his attachments?

Can Sam Gamgee get his modifiers applied for engaging high-engagement enemies?

Do various armor, weapon and other modifying attachments still give their bonusses?

Or does the hero to whom this treachery card is attached simply get cut to a flat 0 in all stats, regardless of other circumstances?

Phrases like "I assume..." and "I would take this to mean..." prompted me to ask Caleb.

Black Breath creates an effect that constantly reduces the attached hero's stats to 0. You can still give the attached hero any amount of attribute boosts, but Black Breath will immediately reduce them back to 0.
