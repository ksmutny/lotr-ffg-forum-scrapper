When dicarding for collatereal damge, iF another damage is pulled when discarding the first 2 cards, we usually play you have to pull 2 cards for that collateral damage also.. But when you pull the additional 2 cards for each other collateral damage in the discard pile, if another one comes up during that, do you pull another 2 cards? Is that clear?

You get CD, pull 2 cards, then see how many CD's are in the discard pile, including the first 2 cards you've already pulled, when then pulling the rest of your cards, if you pull another CD, do you pull an addional 2 cards?

Sorry to disagree,  but this was discussed before (see http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/86498-collateral-damage-peril-in-pelargir/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/86498-collateral-damage-peril-in-pelargir/]) and Caleb was asked and responded saying that each sentence must be processed separately.  Here is the question/answer


Legolas18:

if I discarded another copy of Collateral Damage from the encounter deck with the initial 2 discarded cards, does that mean I have to discard 2 more for the copy just discarded? Or does the "Discard an additional 2 cards from the encounter deck for each copy of CD in the discard pile" effect happen immediately, at the same time as the initial 2 discarded cards, negating any other CDs discarded from having any effect?

Caleb:

"When Revealed" effects are resolved on a sentence-by-sentence basis. When Collateral Damage is revealed, you discard the top 2 cards of your deck first. Then you discard 2 additional cards for each copy of Collateral Damage in the discard pile. Lastly you count the number of locations just discarded and raise your threat by the appropriate amount.
If a copy of Collateral Damage is discarded by the first sentence, then you would count that copy when resolving the second sentence.
