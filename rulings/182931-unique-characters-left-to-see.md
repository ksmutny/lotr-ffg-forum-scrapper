Just making a list of those named characters that still don't have a hero or ally card. Hopefully we'll see a bunch of them during this cycle. Comment if I missed any!

Círdan
Ioreth
Bergil
Tom Bombadil*
Goldberry*
Iorlas
Targon
Rosie Cotton
Leaflock
Ghan-buri-Ghan
Hirgon
Thranduil
Thorin III Stonehelm
Grimbold
The Blue Wizards (less likely)
Robin Smallburrow
Lindir
Galdor
Duinhir
Derufin
Duilin
Dervorin
Hamfast Gamgee
Beechbone

Húrin the Tall

Meneldor


Characters life the monts and dogs I think would be better as attachments.


*Much less likely to see as player cards, but I'd really love to have them. A perfect and thematic way to make them IMO would be to make them neutral allies with the encounter keyword and an event to shuffle him into the encounter deck. It keeps their erratic and uncontrollable nature and it would be awesome when they appear. Then again I guess they could go the strictly thematic route and just make them unavailable as player cards, but if they wanted to give players the choice if they want to have him in the Morgul Vale or not, that'd be the way to do it.

Really like the idea of a Farmer Maggot Hero with 3 unigue dog allies Grip, Fang & Wolf.

 

Put it no your to-do list Caleb!
