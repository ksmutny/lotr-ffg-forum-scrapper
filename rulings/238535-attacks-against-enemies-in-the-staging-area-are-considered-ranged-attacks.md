I'm trying to build a Haldir deck, and I am wondering if attacks against enemies in the staging area are considered ranged attacks ¿? (mostly to see if it's worth adding Rivendell Bow; the deck is meant to be played solo)

Asked Caleb about Haldir's action - if it considered as a ranged attack when attacking an enemy engaged with another player:

> When Haldir uses his effect, it is not considered a ranged attack. Ranged attacks are described in the core rules under the Ranged keyword. When a character with the Ranged keyword declares an attack against an enemy engaged with another player via the Ranged keyword, that is a ranged attack. When you declare Haldir as an attacker via his ability, that is different.

Hello there, my twin brother! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Wow, that ruling is even harsher than I thought it would be. I would have thought that the attacks against other players would be Ranged attacks, but if Caleb's ruling is that you specifically have to be using the Ranged keyword rather than some other ability for it to count as a Ranged attack, then even Haldir's special-ability attacks against enemies engaged with other players won't be Ranged.

In this one case, I think Caleb may be wrong. I mean, as the game designer, he's obviously right in this ruling, because the rules are whatever he makes them. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] But I think it's the wrong rule from a thematic standpoint, and that a rule of "It's a Ranged attack when it would make sense for it to be a Ranged attack, i.e. when a Ranged character has the opportunity to attack an enemy not engaged with him" provides a more thematic experience and thus more enjoyment. I believe that Hands Upon the Bow should be a Ranged attack, and so should Haldir's ability.

But enough about my pet peeve / favorite house rule. I'm glad we have a ruling that clarifies all kinds of "Is this a Ranged attack?" situations; even if it's not the one I would prefer, it's a ruling that will clear up several other card interactions besides Haldir.
