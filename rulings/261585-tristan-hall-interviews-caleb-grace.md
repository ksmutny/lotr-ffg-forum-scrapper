A bit late to the party but always gold!

Here [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1862253/interview-lead-designer-caleb-grace] you go!

Just wanted to say that is a great interview with two people that I admire: Tristan Hall (a.k.a. Ninjadorg and the creator of the gorgeous Gloom of Kilforth) and Caleb Grace (which I guess that we already know :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]).

Cheers!

No not really. Caleb does say that "the line will continue", but the interview is around 6 months old.
