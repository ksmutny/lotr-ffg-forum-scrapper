1.If I use 2 Hobbit Pipes after I play an threat reducing event and I can  see with Gandalf Hero the  Poisoned Counsels on my top of the deck and chose to not trigger the third  pipe?

2.After I defend With Gandalf Hero can I play Flame Of Anor ,ready Gandalf,declare atack one enemy and trigger  another copy of Flame Of Anor to gain aditional attack against that enemy?

3.Can I trigger Flame Of Anor and chose as target ready Gandalf?

Caleb :,,No, you cannot ready a character that is already ready. Gandalf must be exhausted in order to ready him with Flame of Anor."

Hmm. That does seem a little inconsistent. Was the Sam effect ruled on by Caleb as well? Because they are written in essentially the same way. I'm kinda all for not being able to ready a character who's already ready, since it's a core mechanic and makes a degree of sense, but then Sam gets a lot less exciting.

Caleb said that you can't play Flame Of Anor if in play are  only ready Istari characters.

For me the problem is the following:

 

Sam is a response to an action (engaging higher threat enemy), not a deliberate action to influence the game;

 

Flame of Arnor is played with the aim of readying the Istari (note the words "to ready") and therefor a deliberate action to influence;

 

 

So for me, the Flame of Arnor isn't playable if all the istari are ready, while Sam's response is still able to occur even if he is ready because the aim isn't readying Sam...

 

But there is, in fact, the precedent ruling about Sam (which i don't know who ruled). So it should be cleared by Caleb both situations...

 

 

PS: Alogos beat me partially....

GrandSpleen:

Me:,,I want to be sure:if I control only ready Istari charcters I can't play Flame Of Anor,right?"

Caleb:,,That is correct."

So as i though (and alogos) the word "to" is the difference

So, if we follow that line of reasoning, Vilya cannot be used together with Gandalf (hero); the top card will always be revealed while Gandalf is in play, however Vilya uses the same wording as Flame of Anor: "Action: Exhaust Elrond and Vilya to reveal the top card of your deck". That is, if Flame of Anor cannot be played if I control only ready Istari characters, Vilya cannot be used to reveal a revealed card.
