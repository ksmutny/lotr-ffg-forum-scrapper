In Tower of Cirith Ungol, would you interpret locations "Cannot leave the staging area" as "cannot become the active location" or "cannot become the active location or be explored?"

I would suppose that you can't explore them.

Thematically makes sense, you need to get past the Watcher before you start exploring the tower.

Time to abuse Ancient Mathom, Ravenhill Scout, and Asfaloth!

Agree with Rouxxor: They can't leave the staging area in any way, traveling or explored. Of course, if you have enough progress tokens on any location(s), once that restriction is gone, they'd immediately get discarded.

Interesting. I'd never thought of that before. You sure that's right? I ask because it could create funky situations. Is "explored" a flag than once done cannot be undone? For instance, if you get enough progress on a location to explore it, yet it can't be discarded, but then some of those progress tokens are removed... can you still discard it later when locations can leave the staging area? You'd almost have to, otherwise you'd have to "explore" it again, which doesn't really make sense.

I'll send an email to Caleb.

Actually, I now see none of the locations in this quest have an explored trigger, so it's almost a non-issue... yet it could still affect certain player cards like Idraen and others. We'll see what Caleb says.
