The first pack has 3 attachments, allies, and events and it looks like the other packs may follow that format. So probably a tactics attachment master card and a spirit event.

Also I highly doubt we will get more guarded attachments. Caleb threw one in the pack to compliment the contract but I dont think he wants every attachment in this contract a guarded one... That would make deck building pretty boring as people would just use only guarded stuff with he burglars turn. Thats exactly what they dont want to do with these contracts...

You may well be right, and we may have seen our last guarded card.  But as far as what to put in the "Loot Deck," it's already pretty boring: 7-8 Guarded cards (depending on if there's a Hobbit/Sting or Dwarf/Thror's Ring), after which people seem to splash Citadel Plate, Ancestral Armor, Burning Brand, and a few of the other expensive/power items to taste).  So the loot deck is already roughly 80% pre-built, in what I've seen so far.  In my opinion, though, the interesting part of deck-building for the Burglar's Turn isn't the Loot Deck itself (which is boring already), but rather what you do with a 50+ card player deck and trio of heroes that cannot have any innate attachments, and in multi-player how the other deck(s) adapt to pick up the attachment slack of the Burglar.  In this regard, I think it's the most interesting deck-building contract. since it not only radically changes the Burglar's deck but also the deck of the other player(s) involved.

So to that end, I don't think a few more guarded cards would undermine the interesting aspects of the contract.  In fact, I think a few more quality guarded cards would go a long way to helping the contract be a bit more appealing.

Having played quite a bit with the Burglar's Turn contract, I'm pretty comfortable saying that it's the most underwhelming of the contracts so far (all of which my group have proxied and tried to some degree).  Even in 3-Player, with the other two players devoting a portion of their deck to play attachments on the "Burglar" player's characters, I'd say the loot is "meh" at best.  When actively slow-rolling quests as much as possible (e.g. lots of Threat Control and Side Quests), we've typically only claimed 4-6 loot cards per Quest (meaning for any given piece of loot, you have less than a 50% of seeing it appear during a game), and the most loot we have ever claimed in a game was 8 cards--just over half of the deck.  When not building to explicitly slow-roll or when having fewer players with less chance of staging a location each turn, the loot becomes even less frequently claimed. 

The costs of Burglar's Turn are very high: having to give up attachments in one deck is a huge cost, since many of the best cards in the game are attachments (e.g. Steward of Gondor, Unexpected Courage, etc.).   The contract also forces you to travel to locations, which is something most decks never seem to bother with usually, instead preferring to just clear out locations with progress tokens prior to traveling.  So when burglaring you actually have to endure all those travel costs.  If you're not flipping locations, the contract fails to do anything at all (a problem that is more pronounced with fewer players).  The contract also fails to do anything if you travel and flip a unique attachment that is already in play, so if you want to use the Loot Deck as an opportunity to have an additional copy of an item that you also want to include in another player's deck, you risk shutting down the contract on some turns should  another copy come into play first. so you can't use the loot deck to improve the reliability/efficiency of key unique items seeing play.  Finally, the contract increases the quest point of locations for not just loot, but any attachments on the location.  So if you want to use the contract to build synergy with other cards that attach to locations and all the player cards that trigger off of them, you start getting diminishing returns. 


Don't get me wrong, the Burglar's Turn is still a very fun contract as-is, and I'll enjoy using it even if no more guarded cards or quality items drop this cycle.  But I'd like to see a few more, like a Spirit Weapon analog and maybe something for Elves or Dunedain only akin to Sting / Thror's Ring.
