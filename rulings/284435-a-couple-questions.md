So I'm new to board/card games so have some questions for you folk.

1. I know that you are only allowed to attach a maximum of two restricted attachments per hero but are you allowed to attach two of the SAME attachments two a single hero.

For instance attaching 2 "Citadel Plate [https://ringsdb.com/card/01040]" to 1 hero. Or 2 "Dwarven Axe [https://ringsdb.com/card/01041]" to 1 hero. I doubt it but just thought I'd ask.

And what about attachments that aren't restricted, can you attach 2 of the same attachment to 1 hero/ally?

2. Are you allowed to play (and pay with resources) additional cards from your hand after an enemy has revealed it's shadow card?

3. Are you allowed to  play (and pay with resources) just before the player attacks.

> Scenario C : Player 1 has Tactics Bard and is engaged with a non-immune troll, Player 2 has Tactics Legolas, Player 3 has Tactics Gimli.  Player 1 uses Bard to declare an attack on the troll, but since it isn't ranged the troll's defense is not affected.  Legolas can join the attack.  Player 2 can use Legolas to declare an attack on the troll on his turn, but Bard cannot join because he's engaged.  Player 3 cannot declare an attack at all if he lacks a ready ranged character.

I asked Caleb about this issue and his answer was:

> Quote

> No, you cannot participate in an attack against an enemy engaged with you when it is initiated by a teammate using Ranged. Your non-Ranged characters only get to attack during your attack window. Your Ranged characters can join in an attack your teammate initiates, but only if it is against an enemy engaged with another player.

While this is not (yet) adressed in the FAQ, I can at least confirm that Dale is right.

Well, 6.3 on the same page also say that each enemy engaged with a player will get an opportunity to attack during the Combat phase, but no, I don't really think you're missing something in the text of the Rules Reference. However I am certain that if you submitted a rules question Caleb would confirm that immediate attacks do not prevent the enemy attacking normally in the Combat phase as well.

As a relevant precedent, players are also restricted to only declaring one attack against each enemy per round, but this limit is circumvented by card effects which grant attacks (like Quick Strike, Haldir, Hands Upon the Bow, etc). It makes sense that the same principle would apply to enemies - attacks triggered by card effects don't count as their one framework attack for the round.

Edit - And now I see this was answered properly in other threads.
