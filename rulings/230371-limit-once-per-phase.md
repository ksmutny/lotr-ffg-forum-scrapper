> Yes. Any "limit once per X" is checked per card, so you can trigger it multiple times per X if you have multiple copies. The exception is if X is "game", when the limit is checked per player instead.

 

Well, I can think of 1 exception to this. Only one copy of Desperate Alliance can be played by the group each phase.

> The “limit once per phase” on Desperate Alliance should be treated as “limit 1 Desperate Alliance per phase.” That limit is for all players so that only 1 copy of the event can be played by a player group in a phase.

I think for the sake of consistency Desperate Alliance should be errata'd to use language similar to Tighten our Belts: "Only once copy of X can be played by the players each Y".
