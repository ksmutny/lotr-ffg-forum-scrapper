# [&quot;After you travel&quot; trigger timing query](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89609-after-you-travel-trigger-timing-query/)

## 1 [zeb on September 1, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89609-after-you-travel-trigger-timing-query/?do=findComment&comment=855355)

Hi,

 

I travel to Forest Gate:

> Response: After you travel to Forest Gate, the first player may draw 2 cards.

 

So I draw two cards, one of which being Strength of Will:

> Response: After you travel to a location, exhaust a Spirit character to place 2 progress tokens on that locaton.

Can I play it immediately to place 2 progress tokens on Forest Gate I just travelled to? Initially I thought I could do it, because I am still within the travelling phase. But now I am unsure, since I did not have the Strength of Will card when the "After you travel" trigger occurred. Is there any ruling regarding this?

Thanks for your answers. Indeed the rule book says to play Responses immediately after the trigger. But it is not entirely clear to me if the target of this trigger has to be available in your hand. I realised this question can concern some other cards, such as Foe-Hammer:

> Response: After a hero you control attacks and destroys an enemy, exhaust a Weapon card attached to that hero to draw 3 cards.

There is a window of Action at the end of Player Attack. Thus if after I destroy an enemy and I play an Action that allows me to draw cards (e.g. Gandalf) and draw Foe-Hammer, can I still play it immediately, or has the trigger "expired" because of having an Action? Has anyone encountered such situation, with this card or any other card?

 

I have submitted the original question to Caleb and will return to you.

In this case, since an Action has been taken (to draw the response card), the timing for triggering a response for "after destroying an enemy" is definitely passed, so you cannot play that response anymore.

 

Look forward to hearing the official words for the original question, thank you Zeb!

Caleb just answered me, and many of you will probably be surprised, except Nerdmeister :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] . Here is his answer:

 

> Hi Eric,
> You can play the Strength of Will that you drew with the Forest Gate. When multiple Response effects share the same trigger, you can decide which order to trigger them in. So in this example, you can choose to trigger the Forest Gate first to draw 2 cards. One of those cards (Strength of Will) happens to have a Response effect that can be triggered as well, so you choose to play that next.
> Cheers,
> Caleb

 

So I understand that you can queue Responses for the same trigger, and if a response leads to obtain a new Response for the same trigger, you can queue it and play it immediately. For clarification purposes, I have asked him to clarify when a trigger expires. And this is is answer:

> Any Response effect that has a trigger needs to be played immediately after its trigger. (It's because you can only play 1 effect at a time that the players get to choose which order to resolve multiple Response effects with the same trigger.) Once the game advances (a player plays an action, a new phase begins, etc) the opportunity to play a Response is done.

Cool, so now you don't have to have a card in your hand to trigger its effects?

 

But if that is true, how can Thalin's effect happen before Eastern Crow's surge effect? Caleb's new ruling says that between a trigger and its solution there is no time between. So even if you resolve Thalin's effect first, we should still have to reveal the surge effect from Eastern Crows. Because it is triggered immediatly after the Crows are revealed from the encounter deck. But if responses work that why, surge effects should also be queued until every other effect resolves.

 

To give another bizarre example:

 

Say there is a treachery that tells you: "When revealed: "Draw one card and resolve its effect." You draw a card and it is a "A Test of Will". So according to the new rules, as no time has passed at all,  you use it to cancel the treachery's effect. But if you cancel the when revealed effect you cannot draw a card. So you never got "A Test of Will" which means you have to trigger the when revealed effect. You draw a card and it is A Test of Will.....

Interestingly, this question was raised playing Passage, the very first scenario! And it is quite unsettling many people play got it wrong after so many expansions and so much time. This demonstrates that at some point they will need to release a very detaild sequence sheet with more precise timings, similar to what they did for AGoT. I suggested this to Caleb.

Regarding Thalin: don't forget his ability is a Passive effect (no keyword) and thus it takes precedence before any other effect, being Forced or voluntary Action. Furthermore, the card text itself was errata'ed (or at least clarified) that it takes precedence on any keyword. Golden Rule applies. Lastly, Caleb does not say there is no time between trigger and solution, but a trigger does not expire until the game advances with an Action or a new phase.

 

For your second example, it is interesting. Would you care to ask Caleb?

You mean "so many interpret the rules differently than Caleb does"? (I'm not even sure if "so many" is true). One problem is that it was Nate French who designed the earlier cards and he had a slightly different mind about the rules and how they're supposed to work.

I agree that a trigger does not expire when it has been triggered at the same time as another trigger. But a trigger that is triggererd after resolving another trigger is not triggererd at the same time.

 

> For your second example, it is interesting. Would you care to ask Caleb?

I honestly have no clue how to contact him.

And I'm not surprised, too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] It is consistent with other LCG such as CoC.  Nice to know the official ruling, thanks Zeb!

> I am still not  convinced that this ruling is logical, but be it as it be. I'm going to send my example to FFG and I'm anxious to see their explanation.

 

Leptokurt, it would be interesting you submit the "loop" you mentioned above. However, I had some thoughts about it: the Responses here are optional. So if there is a loop, it is only a matter of choice. Breaking the loop is just deciding not to do it (and play "A Test of Will" all over again). The only infinite loop problem would arise only if they both had a Forced effect.

 

Now such kind of games have infinite loops sometimes that break the game. And it happend in the past with LOTR:

 * 
   : that one is a voluntary one that gave infinite resources. It is a voluntary one, and was fixed by errata'ing Beravor.
 * Thalin passive effect also was errata'ed because - in part - of an infinite loop with the Surge effect on the Eastern Crows. So making the Thalin effect prior to Surge solved the issue. A lot of players from MTG were puzzled, because of the stack system. In LOTR, there is no stack, and effects are queued instead, with priorities.

If what you say is an infinite loop, it can be fixed at two levels:

 * Simply by errata'ing the cards responsible for it. It is a straightforward and easy way, but indeed not a global solution
 * Changing or rather precising the rules about timings to prevent loops. This is probably the best solution, although it may be difficult to anticipate all situations and cards, especially those that bend rules with the Golden Rule.

Regarding Caleb, do not forget he is not the only one to decide on rules. He has a team with him that playtest a lot, and he has already reverted rules in the past (e.g. attaching cards to Locations that cannot be targets of player effects).

 

I really think that what we need is a refined turn sequence, which would help squash these interpretations, especially at trigger points.

Lol, to be honest Caleb's answer is mortially offending my philosophical view of the world. But this time I only try to get things right in my head.

This is still silly. There is no other response. You only get the new response from the second Valiant Sacrifice as a result of another response. The other point is simply a PoV of how evebts proceeds - for me I have the following picture in mind:

 

Say someone asks: "Who wants to have a pie?" Several people raise their hands. You count these people and everyone gets a pie. Everyone who comes later gets none.

 

Caleb's picture is:

 

Someone asks: "Who wants to have a pie?" Several people raise their hands. You count these people and everyone gets a pie. Everyone who enters later and raises their hands also gets a pie.

 

So to me the logical approach is to look at one point if there are responses triggering. After that the window for triggering actions is closed. And not to travel back in time to use the trigger again. This is LoTR, not Marvel.
