In two weeks "The Siege of Annúminas" comes to my town. 

The spoiled Host of Angmar needs to be killed in this scenario.

Do you have any ideas how to attack this enemy in the staging area so we not need to optionally engage him?

K .. als Caleb answered me .. the best (and perhaps only) way is to engage this enemy, block him and destroy him. In the staging area he can't be targeted.
