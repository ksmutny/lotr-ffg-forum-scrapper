Haven't seen this elsewhere, so I'll ask:

The text of Mighty Prowess says:  

"Response: After attached hero attacks and destroys an enemy, deal 1 damage to another enemy that shares a Trait with the enemy just destroyed.".

Does the hero have to attack and destroy the enemy alone?  Seems like most cards like this say "If a hero participates in attack that destroys an enemy".

Foe-hammer's trigger condition is "After a hero you control attacks and destroys an enemy...". We know that such a hero can be attacking along with other characters and still be eligible for this effect, e.g., the FAQ on Brand son of Bain.

What if you have two Foe-hammers in hand, two different heroes (each with a single Weapon), and they team up to attack and destroy an enemy? Can you use both Foe-hammers, one on each hero/weapon? Or is only one of them actually responsible for the "destroys an enemy" part of the trigger condition?
