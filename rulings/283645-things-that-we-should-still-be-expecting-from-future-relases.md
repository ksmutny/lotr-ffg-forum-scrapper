Hi guys, today i wanted to start the topic of things that we should look forward when we look into LOTR LCG future. The game has obviously gotten incredibly big already, but in my opinion it's the closest board game/card game ever that allows players to replicate the Middle Earth experience in various ways, allowing us to have fun with both recreating the events of the books, reimagining them or just having fun in this incredibly rich world just doing the FFG original questlines. But in my opinion the game shouldn't be finished (as many are speculating that current cycle is the last), before we get a few more missing pieces to making the game actually "feel" complete. This is my list of things, in no particular order, that ffg should really take a look at.

1)  Scourging of Shire - Print on Demand Saga Expansion (Fog on Barrow-dawns and Old Forest style)

So the real climax of Return of the King is yet to make its way to the game. It's easy to implement as Gencon or Fellowship scenario and its the one i've been hyped for since forever. 

2) Finishing the Nightmare Series.

Nightmare scenarios are really important to more dedicated players. It allows them to both up the difficulty of the easier quests and improve the mechanics of them. Most of nightmare relases have really added to the game and it should be on ffg's list to finish of what they started:

> Finishing off the Nightmare Saga

> Finishing off the Nightmare Cycles

> Adding Nightmare Print on Demand Fog on Barrow Downs and Old Forest for complete nightmare saga experience.

3) New Versions of some classic characters.

One of the main draws of the game is how they can play as almost any major and minor character from LOTR and Hobbit books. Unfortunetely, some fan favorites have fallen behind and them getting a new version would certainly be welcome, even if only to diversify the options. Similarly to how Pipin and Faramir got their new, stronger and better cards, there are some characters that deserve the same treatment:

> Bilbo Baggins. Absolutely beloved character, a fan favorite hobbit is just not exciting anymore, even if just for the fact that his hero card is really old at this point and most people have already played his (mediocre) card a lot already. Maybe introducing a more willpower-oriented (his love of adventure) and attachment-oriented (he really is an owner of a lot of fascinating items) Bilbo is what we should be looking at. Probably spirit sphere, if we're aiming to get younger Bilbo right.

> Radagast and Saruman hero cards. Both of these Istaris have already received their ally versions, but unlike Gandalf getting a hero card never happened to those two. They should probably continue a trend of being neutral and getting resource icons while fullfilling specific conditions - this could be getting icons when playing creatures or after playing a doomed card.

> Tom Bombadil and Goldberry. These two should probably get ally versions that either go away at the end of turn like original gandalf did or they should be shuffled into encounter deck via encounter keyword. No matter what way ffg will choose, these two should not be ommited.

> Gandalf The White hero card. While he would need to have a weird mechanic disallowing you or other players from playing basic Gandalf ("No player can play or own cards named "Gandalf" while "Gandalf the White" is in play), i think the differenciasion should be made. Gandalf the White is a different character in many, many ways and why would we deny ourselves getting awesome Gandalf the White art?

> Some more important minor ally characters . What comes to my mind is Nob (the Balirman helper in Brancing Pony) and Bergil (Beregond's son) but there are probably more characters that are of some sort of importance and not depicted in the game yet.

4) Mordor-oriented cycle. It could also touch on some more unexplored regions like Rhun and Khand.

The reason why i believe Rhovanion is not the final cycle is because i believe the designers wouldn't deny themselves bringing the party to Mordor for some reason or another at the very end. Maybe it could be a mission to try to cause more infighting with the orcs and try to weaken the strenght of the enemy? We could even see some Shadow of Mordor-style mechanics with getting Orc objective allies that temporary join us because of some magic influence.

5) Utilising the Saga Mechanics once again.

Saga expansions were brilliant and i think we all agree on that. I think that bringing their mechanics (campaign cards, boons, burdens, pernament death and threat penalties) to old cycles would do them a lot of good. It would probably take a few PoD expansions, but imagine the replayability it would bring to old cycles if, for example, you were able to play old Hunt for Gollum mirkwood as a campaign with added immesion of using the same characters and actually being rewarded for it. Campaign always introduced a lot of decision-making between quests and brought a much-needed sense of progression to the game. I think adding campaign mechanics to regular cycles would do them a lot of good.

5,5) (controversial and not actually needed a lot) Remaking the Hobbit boxes completely.

The Hobbit has a very important place in most of our hearts, but Hobbit boxes are possibly some of the worst quests in the game. I think revamping the Hobbit and adding the fully-fleshed out campaign mode to it with maybe some new treasure mechanics added would do it a lot of good.

 

So, what do you think guys? What is the most interesting out of those for you? What do you personally expect?

Nice thread. I know a lot gets said about the "future of the game", both pessimistic and optimistic but it's always a fun topic for discussion and good to hear some of the ideas out there.

1) Completely agree. I'm surprised it wasn't 2018 GenCon like many predicted. Some have suggested Caleb might leave it to be his parting gift to players - before he sails off to the undying lands - and that is a comforting thought.

2) Unless there's some disaster, I imagine FFG will do their best to tie up all Nightmare products for all released saga and cycles. I'm not a big Nightmare player so haven't considered Old Forest and Fog before, but yeah, unfortunately I could see them being missed out as they're PoD...

3) Everyone's favourite topic? Well, now we have Thranduil, Thorin III etc so the gaps are being filled in. I would personally love those wizard heroes but could understand if the designers chose to keep them as powerful allies only, certainly in Saruman's case - Radagast would need a new ally version at the very least. Tom and Goldberry I would argue shouldn't be player cards - only part of the encounter deck for any quests set in their realm (such as Tom in his PoD quests). If they do become player cards, then their effect would have to be quite abstract.

Now that sagas are over, Frodo and Bilbo need new player cards for sure. Sam is also a massive character with too few player cards. I guess a danger is having all-spirit hobbit heroes but I could see a Lore Frodo, Tactics Sam and Spirit Bilbo, maybe. Really, there needs to be a leadership hero other than Sam as well, but who? More hobbit cards are surely on the way: The Gaffer, Nob, Tom Cotton's sons...

4) The Mordor locale could be fun. On the other end of the scale, I'd like to see something closer to the Shire and Bree. Less epic but with some intrigue, hunting Sauron's spies for example. Alternatively, could Caleb ever consider a War in the North saga-style adventure, culminating in the Battle of Dale? I'd play that!

5) I'd love that too, but it would take serious work, and well as some head scratching to solve weird story jumps (see Dwarrowdelf).

Despite some frustrations, I liked Thew Hobbit boxes, re-doing those wouldn't be a priority for me.

Interested to read what other people are looking forward to

I agree with every single point here, (except for Gandalf the White hero), as I've made them myself numerous times before, especially the Istari heroes and Bombadil and Goldberry with Encounter keyword. Let's hope Caleb agrees too!
