Goddamn AMAZING player cards.

Orophin is an auto include in my decks and I'm already looking at making space for Henneth Annen Guard, Galadriel's Handmaiden and Cloak of Lorien.

So thematic and amazing art on all of them. Really enjoyed Matt and Caleb (and team Covenents) banter and discussion of the cards. Can't wait to see the encounter cards as well.
