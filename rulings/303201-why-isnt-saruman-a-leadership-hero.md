I understand completely why Radaghast is Lore and Gandfalf is what he is.  But I can't for the life of me figure out why Saruman is Lore and not Leadership as he was the leader of the wizards, the White Council, and the White Hand.  Help me understand!

He is corrupted by a thirst for power and knowledge, so I can see it going either way. I do wish he was able to change his sphere to reflect the many colors thing, and not just when playing the doomed cards.

I'm actually more bummed that he can't use the Palantir without that noble trait card. The threat gain would be crazy, but where's the fun in not letting Saruman use his iconic artifact? 

Lol, I don't even consider that palantir to exist. Pretty sure that we'll see new palantiri this cycle with the new Caleb-modern-design-and-balance-criteria (i.e. what was absent from the ATS cycle)
