cool interview. He did ping Caleb twice there at the beginning of this just being the end of the saga and not THE END.   So that is good to hear, haha. Even though news is slow, that is probably the best confirmation we'll see that there is still material forthcoming...at least how I interpreted it.

That's how I took it too.  But if we're down to one deluxe & cycle per year things will be much slower than before.

I really hope it means a new cycle is comming and not some PoD quests and Nightmare ones. It would make me really sad to see the game end now that it's getting interesting.

I don't mind a slower pace if it means they will keep developing new cycles for it.

I was happy to see this interview with Caleb. He's come a long way as a designer since Over Hill and Under Hill (though I still enjoy those quests), and he has consistently translated the spirit of the books into creative and fun quests in the Saga expansions. He's also told a relatively cohesive and comprehensive story (with each LotR Saga quest taking the name of a chapter) by following Frodo and Aragorn's stories while finding a way to incorporate other highlights (like Rouse the Ents at the beginning of The Road to Isengard). I'm happy to see that players like me who want to recreate the books in their campaign will not suffer from playing a minimal/no ally deck for Mount Doom. BTW, to recreate the books in my campaign, I'm still hoping for ally versions of Aragorn (for A Knife in the Dark and Flight to the Ford), Merry and Pippin (for The Ring Goes South and Journey in the Dark), and Éomer (for The Uruk-Hai). I'd also like a hero version of Grimbold (to accompany Gandalf and Erkenbrand in a reinforcements deck) for Helm's Deep.

Here's some speculation about the twist ending Caleb talked about for Mount Doom. He said (slightly condensed, starting at 10:56):

> That was such a part of the books, right? That Frodo [..] unbelievably he makes it all the way into Mordor to Mount Doom from the Shire, from his little round door, and he's made it and he's like "No, I'm going to keep it." That moment of like, WHAT!? So that's definitely a risk that could happen in your game as well, and there is kinda a twist ending that I don't want to give away. I really want people when they read it for the first time to go "What!?" and I hope... yeah, we should get emails about that. [...] I think you're going to love it. Especially if you're a fan of the books, you're going to recognize like, "Oh that's perfect." That's what I hope you should feel, and that's where just about everybody [at FFG] was a big fan too. It is a little bit of a risk, which is why there was some initial pushback of like, "We're going to get angry emails." So, we'll see.

While I have no idea how Fortitude tests work, I suspect that the end of Mount Doom (potential SPOILER)

will not allow players to win through questing successfully or simply passing Fortitude tests; instead I imagine that players will have to survive long enough for Gollum to destroy the ring, so the conclusion will be a bit more passive once you've managed to reach that point, connected to Frodo's mercy towards Gollum, and perhaps eucatastrophic.

There'll also be an Eagle objective ally in The Black Gate Opens, perhaps like the eucatastrophic ally from The Battle of Five Armies, where you expect punishment from the encounter deck and instead receive help unlooked for.
