This was inspired by the Hero Championship, which I wanted to emulate to see what were people's favorite quests.

SO, everyone who wishes to participate will vote on their top 10 favorite quests, out of all the ones available. Favorite can mean, best designed, most thematic, most fun, great difficulty level, whatever criteria you wish. The quests with the most votes will make it to the first round of voting where 2 quests will be directly paired up, and everyone votes on 1 or the other. Eventually we will make it to our top 3 where you will vote for 1st 2nd and 3rd place. If you vote for the Nightmare version of a quest I will just count it as if for the regular one. 

 

The 3rd round of voting is up! 1-10-15

 

1. Wastes of Eriador vs. Flight to the Ford

2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Seventh Level

3. Fog on the Barrow Downs vs. Massing at Osgiliath

4. Helms Deep vs. Encounter at Amon Dun

5. Foundations of Stone vs. Stewards Fear

6. Three Trials vs. Siege of Cair Andros

1. Wastes of Eriador

2. Breaking of Fellowship: I’ve only played this quest once. It was a 4-player game with Caleb Grace at worlds. It was so much fun, I’m nervous about going back and playing it again.

3. Intruders in Chetwood: Both quests are “meh” for me. I suppose I’ve played this quest more

4. Massing at Osiliath: The OG GenCon quest, much loved and adored

5. Seventh level: SoE is a better designed quest, but building a deck to thrash goblin weenies is a Guilt pleasure on mine. Sometimes I’ll just keep playing once I’ve won and increase the number of revealed cards each round to see how far I can get.

6. Helms Deep: I played only this quest for two weeks straight and still love going back to it

7. Foundations of Stone: I can actually win this quest

8. Mount Gram:

9. Battle of Carn Dum:

10. Journey Down the Anduin:

11. Steward’s Fear: I can actually win this quest

12. The Druaden Forest:

13. Shadow of the Past:

14. (The) Battle of (the) Five Armies: ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

15. Blood of Gondor: Try this quest with a mono-tactics deck, it’s a ton of fun

16. Encounter at Amon Din: I love teaching the game with this quest
