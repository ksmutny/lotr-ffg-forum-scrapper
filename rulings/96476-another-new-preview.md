looks like elves will be a focus of this cycle!

 

looks like it won't really be a Rohan cycle (which is to be expected, given the previous cycles' player cards not really matching their location) and Secrecy returns!

Wow!  Love what Caleb and Matt are doing.  I liked how he discussed developing a thematic core for a trait, so that it has a strong identity and mirrors the role of the race in the books.  The biggest complaint about Gondor, aside from it being underdeveloped, is that it lacks a clear identity.  With one AP, it seems like Silvan will have a clearly defined role in the game.    

And perhaps we got a little foreshadowing of this with Silvan Refugee and Children of the Sea, both of which look a lot more valuable now (though I always liked Silvan Refugee).

Awesome ability on Celeborn. This means we might see Lady Galadriel by the end of the cycle. And it seems like there will be a new focus for each AP--so it will not only be Silvan which gets developed but, in Caleb's words, "a smattering of Middle Earth." Secrecy hint as well. Looking forward to this year!

Absolutely, the history of Eregion is one of my favorite parts of the lore. Caleb and Matt have done their homework and are going deep into the lore. Ost-in-Edhil played a major role in the manufacture of the rings of power and the battle against Sauron, but also in the alienation of the local peoples of the area who later became the Dunlendings. The thematic synergy here is nice and I can't wait to read the story that FFG has written for this cycle. Hopefully we'll see a bit more of the area of Eregion, I'd especially like to see the ruins of Tharbad.

 

I was already excited for this cycle before and I'm over the top excited now.

I'm glad they haven't abandoned secrecy. I hate when a CCG abandons support for a deficient game mechanic and you're stuck with a whole bunch of cards you'll rarely (or never) use. I trust that Caleb and Matt have taken a hard look at secrecy, identified its weaknesses and now the mechanic will be resurrected in grand style!

 

Plus... more mount support? I'm very curious.

Agreed, agreed. Add to that my hopes for magic ring attachments (either rings of power or just lesser magic rings) and maybe even some lost seeing-stones.

This expansion and cycle are just blowing away expectations so far, such a great time to be a fan of this game. The way the cycle is described I wouldn't be surprised if we saw each AP focus on a particular gameplay style. Much more preferable to the old way of waiting for the max potential (or maybe I just harbor bad memories of waiting forever for Anborn and Visionary Leadership).

Cannot wait to play with the silvan elves, looks like an incredibly fun deck archetype to run, the only question now is who the accompanying two heroes will be with Celeborn. A tri-sphere with Elrond and spirit Glorfindel could probably work.

Love that Caleb is hitting his stride here,

I don't know about you guys, but Caleb, Matthew and FFG in general know how to create spectation. And it was well delivered.

 

I love also, and that's my opinion, the caring and love these two guys are putting on theme, to the point of making each known trait on this game unique to play. That's something that makes me want to play each and every type of deck.

 

The mechanics, interesting. The art, you know, we need to create a new adjective for excellency, like LOTR-esque art, because saying it's beautiful sounds shallow.
