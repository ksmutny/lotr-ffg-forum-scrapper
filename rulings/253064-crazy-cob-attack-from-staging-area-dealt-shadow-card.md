# [Crazy Cob - attack from staging area - dealt shadow card?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253064-crazy-cob-attack-from-staging-area-dealt-shadow-card/)

I'm just starting Flies and Spiders, and have drawn a Crazy Cob as my first setup card. It says on revealed it attacks the character with the most poison.

Does this attack get dealt a shadow card as normal?

Since no characters are poisoned, does it even attack? I guess it does, but I just pick a character of my choice.

Pretty sure that there were cases in Blood of Gondor where Caleb ruled that enemies who attacked during an ambush after the beginning of the combat phase (and after shadow cards had already been dealt to engaged attackers at the beginning of the phase) would not be dealt a shadow card. 

Not sure if that has since been overturned?
