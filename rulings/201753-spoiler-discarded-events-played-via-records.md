(I feel like this might have been discussed to a certain extent somewhere already, but I can't find it...)

Several of the Grey Havens events have effects that depend on the # of copies in your discard pile. If 1x Skyward Volley is in your discard pile, and you play it via the Book of Eldacar, do you:

- Resolve the main effect twice because you do have a copy of Skyward Volley in the discard pile (itself), or

- Resolve it only once because that copy is considered to be in your hand and NOT the discard pile anymore...?

We discussed it with Elwing's Flight and Map of Earnil in this thread: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/]

Don't think we got an entirely definite conclusion though. Maybe someone should ask Caleb.
