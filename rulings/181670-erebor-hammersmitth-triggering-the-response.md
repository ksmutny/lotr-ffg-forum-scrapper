# [Erebor Hammersmitth - Triggering the Response](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181670-erebor-hammersmitth-triggering-the-response/)

Can I trigger the response of the Erebor Hammersmith if I put him into play via, for example, A Very Good Tale or Sneak Attack?

His ability reads: "after you play EH ....".

Now, does playing include putting into play or does it specifically mean playing from your hand, as some other cards specify (West Road Traveller, Galadriel ally, for example)?

 

I think after leaning for the former I am now more inclined towards the latter.

I have received a ruling from Caleb regarding this situation that, to my knowledge, had never been answered by a developer until now, though I may have overlooked it.

 

> Q: If you exhaust Elrond and Vilya to reveal an ally on the top of your deck can you : 1) put him into play at no cost, 2) play him at no cost, or 3) choose to play him at no cost or put him into play?

> A: When you use Vilya’s ability and the top card of your deck is an ally or attachment, you put it into play. The added language about “play at no cost” is there for when the top card of your deck is an event, because you don’t put events into play.
