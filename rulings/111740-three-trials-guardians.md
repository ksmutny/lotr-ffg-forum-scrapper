Hey folks,

 

Wanted to throw out the question of, 

Because of the effect on the Quest cards, "The first player engages the guardian" 

is that a constant effect that prevents a solo player from ever disengaging the guardians?

In other words, if you sent them to the staging area would they just automatically re-engage you?

We asked Caleb what would happen if a "engage the first player" constant effect occures while a not-first player play hammer stroke, when the quest reads "when an enemy engage a player" and he answered that it would trigger both engagement, well, getting hard to explain so I'll just quote him :

> 
> If a player used a card effect to engage Chief Turch, he would remove 1 time counter for that engagement. Then, Chief Turch’s passive effect would immediately cause him to engage the first player again, removing another time counter for a total of 2 time counters removed.
