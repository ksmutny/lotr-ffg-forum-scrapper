Can a trigger for when an enemy is "added to the staging area" only occur when it first enters play? Or does it also trigger when sent back to the staging area (such as via Guardian of Ithilien or Fastred)?

And the result: 

-----------


When an enemy is ‘returned’ to the staging area, it is not ‘added.’ Enemies are added to the staging area after they are revealed by the encounter deck, or put into play by an effect. Essentially, for an enemy to be ‘added’ to the staging area, it has to originate from some out-of-play state.
