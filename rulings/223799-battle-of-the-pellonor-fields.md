Man, this looks awesome! Love the way that they tie in the scenarios beyond just boons and burdens with the Corsairs and the Harad.

> Beyond the fact that they take you as close to the Nine Walkers and their stories as you can get with any game, the Saga Expansions for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game are remarkable for the ways they ensure that every decision you make has lasting consequences.
> 
> Through the first four Saga Expansions, these consequences have come primarily in the form of boons and burdens, as well as the inability to play with any characters that appear on your list of fallen heroes. Now, however, as we look forward to The Flame of the West, we see new weight and new dimensions to your decisions. Will Aragorn show up in time to aid the defense of Minas Tirith? Will the White City's defenders fall to the Haradrim who managed to survive Faramir's ambush?

> You'll have your chance to make your decisions and to live with the outcomes when The Flame of the West arrives at retailers. This first Saga Expansion from The Return of the King is on its way, so be sure to pre-order your copy today!

And its flip side:

I had high expectations for this quest, since it involves so many different elements coming together. I love the narrative flow through the different quest stages, as the pressure and the stakes get higher (but there are also moments of hope when Rohan and Aragorn arrive).

 

I had thought that the quest might involve players on separate stages (if there were multiple players) to represent the Rohirrim getting closer to Gondor and finally arriving. That wouldn't work well for solo, though. My theme OCD is slightly disappointed because it feels like Rohan heroes shouldn't be present at the start of the game, but I'll get over it. The Rohan player's contributions will represent the fact that Witch-King diverted an army to try to stop Rohan from reaching Minas Tirith.

 

I wonder how significant Aragorn's arrival will be. He has good stats (and potentially Sword that was Broken), but I wonder whether there will be any encounter cards that are less bad if Aragorn's in play (or perhaps the fellowship player card in the box will really help for this quest, but Aragorn needs to be in play to use it).

 

Way to go, Caleb! This looks richly thematic and epic, and I am definitely looking forward to it.
