I was reading this attempt of PR and interpreted it as follows: 

> Quote
> 
> How big is the Fantasy Flight Interactive team? What kind of staff does it take to make a game like this?
> 
> Fantasy Flight Interactive is a very small team that works with partner studios. Rather than establishing a huge studio presence, we have a small team that oversees the design, production, art, sound, and testing of the games we bring to life. We work with partner developers who write the game code, as well as both creating new assets and implementing game assets we provide. 
> 
> This way, we can stay lean as a studio, but leverage larger teams to create the games we work on. It also allows us to be more agile since, now that we’re established, we can create more than one game at once in the future by working with more than one team at a time around the world. 
> 
> Our internal staff includes testers, producers, designers, and art and programming direction staff. Overall head count is still less than a dozen people internally, but with a reach that extends far beyond that. 
> 
> In addition, we work with the creative design and art staff at Fantasy Flight Games in Roseville, Minnesota as well as our publisher, Asmodee Digital out of Paris. In this way, we can have 24 hour development as our development partners around the world work together.

We are not really a video game studio. We outsource small tasks like coding and asset development in order to have more time for outsourcing more stuff. This way we can create more hits that follow the steps of the Lord of the Rings: the Living Card Game. We are about 12 people in here. Our designers dismantle the tabletop version and our artists organize the assets FFG gave us in folders so we can email them to the outside crew. We also throw the word Paris in here, because it's cool. Bonjour!

> What is the relationship between Fantasy Flight Interactive and Fantasy Flight Games?
> 
> Fantasy Flight Games is both our partner and inspiration. They are the authors and creators of the games we develop into digital titles. They are also our partners, as they are involved in the design and art direction decisions that we make. We work with the original development teams and the digital team at FFG as much as we can—they are instrumental in our development process, providing support in art direction, design direction, and game scripting.
> 
> We also work with Asmodee North America, who support us with marketing, promotion, and licensing support. Working with each of these sister teams means that even though our own staff is small, we still have global reach and resources.

Since we are not a serious video game developer we are relying mostly on FFG and Asmodee. We are constantly calling Caleb for some help but he doesn't pick up for some reason.

> 
> How would you summarize the studio’s approach to game design?
> 
> We have a really indie house design approach. Because we’re so small, we’re fairly experimental. Our studio was formed to explore the digital design space—not just crank out ports from tabletop to digital. We want to create new and unique games based on the tabletop properties, and that means taking risks and trying new things.

This is a student project for college credits. We want to stress this because our game is basically HeartStone's UI with 3/10 of LotR LCG. We consider this a new and unique game that 30-40 (24 hour peak) players want to play. Making a faithful port, i.e. adopting the tabletop 1:1 would probably be way better, but it wouldn't justify us taking unnecessary risks which will look way cooler when they will make our biopic. In addition, as you can tell from our recent change in monetary policy, taking risks means not really thinking ahead or reading the market.

> Why did FFI decide to release The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game in Early Access? What does Early Access mean?
> 
> Early Access is part of the experimental philosophy. Specifically, Early Access is a program on Steam where games that aren’t considered complete can be released to the public for input into development. A major pillar of our philosophy is to be open and communicative with our audience, and Early Access lets us interact with our fanbase in a way that traditional releases just don’t. We support this approach with constant refreshes on our Steam Community pages [https://steamcommunity.com/app/509580] and twice-weekly Twitch video streams [https://www.twitch.tv/ffigames].
> 
> On one hand, this means that users have to deal with the issues you might see in a beta release, such as occasional missing features or incomplete content, but on the other hand, players get to be part of our community and directly influence the direction the game is going into the future. We feel that what we gain in adaptability and real-world player feedback more than makes up for any instability or incomplete polish!

First of all, by occasional we mean often. Since we have zero faith in our product we treat whatever players come our way as test subjects in order to understand what we want to make. This might make the final game 10% more appealing to any potential gamers that still care after all this. As mentioned above, we don't really have a plan. We feel that what we gain in adaptability and real-world player feedback more than makes up for any instability or incomplete polish, the latter two being completely irrelevant when it comes to a good first impression. We also stream the same quests over and over again and press refresh on Chrome once in a while to see if there are any new posts on the steam forums. We make sure to address only the hyper positive ones and not the ones with criticism since this is Early Access.

> 
> What’s next for The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game? What can players expect during Early Access?
> 
> Already we’ve released free new cards to players, and have upcoming free adventures we call Encounters, which are singular quests that are either more challenging or test out new features. All players in Early Access get this content completely free. Coming up we’ll have Cooperative play going live online, as we want to have the chance to test this and adjust based on player feedback before we go live.
> 
> We also have our first Expansion Pack, The Shadow’s Fall, coming up before we exit Early Access. This package will include four new heroes, sixteen new player cards and seventeen new cards in our Valor Vault that players can earn through play, as well as new avatars, an all-new card back, and a new player nametag frame.
> 
> Looking even beyond that, we have all-new campaigns, heroes, and play modes in the works. We have ambitions of introducing a survival mode, draft play, competitive play, and even a Saga mode, where players can play through the entirety of The Lord of the Rings books as well as The Hobbit. That’s all for the future, however, as we focus on polishing the game during Early Access.

Our dream is to make the money that FFG makes selling from Adventure Packs and box expansions without printing cards. We don't make a 1:1 adaptation of the tabletop but would really like a 1:1 adaptation of the money it makes.

> What’s the future look like for FFI? Any hints about upcoming titles?
> 
> We have an embarrassment of riches from Fantasy Flight Games to choose from. With so many great games and limited time and resources, the biggest challenge has been picking which games to pursue next. We have two games planned for release in the next eighteen months, in addition to The Lord of the Rings: Living Card Game, but you’ll just have to stay tuned to see what they are.

After the big success of the Lord of the Rings: the Living Card Game, we are carefully thinking which game to simplify next and offer low effort DLCs for. Stay tuned to see which two favorite franchises we have chosen.
