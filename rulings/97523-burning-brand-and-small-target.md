Do they combo?  ffg_a-burning-brand-catc.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_a-burning-brand-catc.jpg]ffg_small-target-eaad.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_small-target-eaad.jpg]

 

So does BB take away shadow effects for Small Target's effect too?  I don't see why not.  BB cancels all shadow effects dealt to the attacking enemy.  And in small target it says if the attacking enemy's shadow card has no shadow effect.........

 

Thanks

Text is too small ><

 

Ok, so you are just revealing the attacking enemy's shadow card, and not resolving it, so Balin has no effect... Burning Brand is more debatable. Cards having no shadow effect is quite the borderline text... does it include a shadow effect with no effect ? does it imply that it must have a shadow card ? what about multiple shadow cards ? etc...

 

I vote «ask Caleb» :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I don't have the slightest clue on how/where to ask Caleb (and I don't mean to) so somebody else can or i'll just say that burning brand does combo with Small Target.  

 

Thanks guys.  I'm Surprised nobody has found the answer to this previously.  Seems like such a......whats the word..... bread and butter combo. (I dont think thats even a saying but you know what I mean  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])

But... why would any one let a lore hobbit defend against a 4+ ATT enemy? They're not on a suicidal mission!
