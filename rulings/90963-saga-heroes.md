Now that the Black Riders is out, it seems clear that doing the entire trilogy in this manner will mean 5 more Saga expansions.  If they follow the usual pattern, that means 4 heroes per Saga Expansion.  That's 20 more heroes!  At this point, I'm wondering who in the heck we are going to see?  I for one would like to see Erkenbrand--most likely a tactics hero.  And some more hobbits would be nice, even if it's just different sphere versions of the ones we have, though I generally am not a huge fan of the multiple-sphere-versions of heroes thing, mainly because it means multiplayer games are more limited in who can play who.  On the other hand, having 2 Aragorns means more flexibility in deck building around this great hero, which is pretty cool.  

 

So who will we see?  Tactics Aragorn?  Spirit Samwise?  Erkenbrand?  Another Faramir or Eowyn?  Maybe Leadership Éomer or Théoden!  Thoughts?

I mostly play two handed, but I would love to see ally versions of the main characters so that you could potentially run the full fellowship in a solo deck (or even the full fellowship in a two player game, which is close but not quite possible at the moment).  I'd also like versions of the characters that work together when they are a part of the fellowship, or abilities that play off of each other.  Sort of Elladan and Elrohir, but on a much bigger scale.

Caleb in his Team Covenant interview alluded that this could happen, but I don't think it is likely, but I want to see alternate ring-bearers.  The next saga expansion could potentially include Galadriel and or Boromir ring-bearer versions (Gandalf and Tom Bombadil could have been alternate ring-bearers in Black Riders).  I know that the saga-expansions are focused on telling the story of the books, but one of the reasons I like the game is that you are having your own adventures in Middle Earth.  Alternate ring-bearers would be a great way to explore what could have happened at these crucial moments in the Third Age.

Even though it feels like theres already been a number of topics already talking about this...I still really enjoy the conversation.  

I originally speculated we would see new versions Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas along with potentially a second Elrond, hero version of Arwen, Haldir, Celeborn, or Galadriel.  A lot of people have considered getting a new Boromir too, but I think its far more likely that if we see him it will be as an ally since I think if any hero is remade two times first it will be Aragorn and I truly dont see Boromir fitting into Lore or Spirit.

 

I was pretty firm on this opinion until i watched team covenant's interview with Caleb and his explanations of design choices in black riders.  He mentioned Aragorn wasnt included in the set because the saga expansions are marketed towards newer/casual players who may only have the core set and might be discouraged at getting repeat characters whenever they already have so few heroes to begin with.

 

This design choice eliminates 3 of my original guesses.  Also keeping in mind that when the voice of isen site went live there was short lived artwork of what looked like Haldir but was replaced with Eomer.  There is also the elven female warrior on the site who may or may not be Arwen.  This kind of leaves Elrond, Celeborn, Galadriel, then either Haldir/Arwen (whomever is not used in VOI) as the only significant heroes left to make heroes of for the second box.

 

All of this could be BS by the time we figure out who they are, but using the logic of the facts we are currently presented with it seems to make sense
