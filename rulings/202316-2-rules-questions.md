Please, help remind me. The first question is about multiple defenders, it is so long since I had used them but I was thinking about the new Anchor Watch card. When you have multiple defenders of an attack, thanks to Stand Together, Dori or the above, and the attack strength is higher than the defense, how do you deal damage? Do you have to apply it all to one character? And can you overkill it?

 

The second is with Hands Upon the Bow and Quick Strike against immune to player cards enemies. If I remember correctly, the former is not allowed whilst the latter is, but I am not sure, and am not sure if I see why, the wording seems almost the exact same.

 

Thanks!

1. Yes, if youhave multiple defenders only one will take the damage even if it's Overkill 

 

2. I fear Davachido is wrong, both, "Hands upon the bow" and "Quick Strike" target your own character and allow them to make an attack against an enemie (and immune to Player Card effects doesn't prevent getting attacked):

This would also fit with the Report in the cardgamedb rules clarification threat (page 4, right at the top):

Caleb says, that you can attack Bolg, who is immune to Player Card effects, with "Hands upon the bow"

 

Edit: My 2nd point is wrong, the ruling I refer to is outdated (see next post by GrandSpleen)

Thanks Grand, that's the ruling I remembered, wasn't sure where I saw it but good that it's in the FAQ now.

 

I think there's an old thread on BGG where someone got a reply from Caleb about it. Basically something about QS makes an attack target an eligible enemy which means that the card is only targeting a character to allow them to attack out of the attack phase.

 

Whereas hand upon the bow allows you to circumvent normal attack rules for targeting, similar to Dunhere, by targeting that enemy with the ability on the card. At least that's what the officially ruling goes anyway.
