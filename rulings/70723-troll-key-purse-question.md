Had a look through the topics but could not locate any that addressed this question: if these objectives are added to the staging area in quest stage 1 (1st Hobbit quest) before any trolls appear, does this mean they can never be claimed? That they are simply placed in the staging area unguarded and thus are never attached to a troll? Which means ultimately heroes cannot have Sacks removed by Bilbo (hence, at all)?

Maybe I am missing something but if not it seems overly harsh that you can practically lose the game at the turn of the first card.

im sure someone sent a clarification request to caleb- ill try and find it

EDIT - here you are - from james at bgg


If there are no Troll enemies in play when Troll Purse or Troll Key are revealed, then they are placed in the discard pile.
Cheers,

I don't know how you guys beat this one.  I was very excited about the Hobbit quests, but I couldn't ever get past the first quest, so I didn't go on to the next two for sake of the story.  But now that Caleb said that the player cards were all designed and then sorted, I'm hoping that the cards in On the Doorstep (NEXT WEEK!!!) will help my chances.
