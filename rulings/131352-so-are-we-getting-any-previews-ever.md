This is getting mildly annoying. The last actual news article was published in the 3rd of November. It's been more than 2 months. I will not talk about other LCG's since they seem to be completely out of sync with ours (SW just got their new expansion while we'll get ours presumably late March), but seriously, is there anything that the designers can preview at this point? It seems like this is the "dry season" for LOTR LCG, and I understand they don't want to prevew stuff too much ahead of time, but we already got our announcements. Is a little preview too much to ask?

There is no need to panic. There is a lot of materials for the game planned.

 

I think Matt and Caleb should have some difficulties with the creation of the scenarios of The Flame of The West.

There is a lot of events in The return of The King (they can create at least 7 or 8 scenarios till the end) , and it should be hard balance difficulty (especially with the Boons Burdens fot the lasts scenarios).

 

Nonetheless, i don't understand why we had a giant new (Nightmare of the end of ring maker + Nightmare of The Road Darkens) instead of 2 little news with a gap of 2 or 3 weeks. I prefer to have more regular news, even with less contents.

I was about to make a thread titled "So, are we getting any cards ever?" but maybe it's better to keep that discussion here.

Caleb, Matt and the art director sure do a great job, but with each passing day I wish this game was being made by anyone BUT FFG. They just never deliver, on time at least.

FFG does have a tendency to make some bad decisions. Like cancelling Battlelore for example, (but not telling anyone that they cancelled it). I hate their inane secrecy. I should become a playtester for every game just so that I don't have to deal with the secrecy. My guess is that there will be one more cycle after this, and the final Saga will be released at Gencon 2017, followed by the final packs in cycle 7 to end the game around Worlds 2017. Then we get to work on the legacy project. I've got quite a few plans already for organizing it.

 

 

And then, my Runebound LCG I have been designing forever will get accepted by LCG and published! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Yeah right.
