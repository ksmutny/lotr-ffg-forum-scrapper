I would love to see FFG create an official meta-game linking together the various cycles while at the same time going beyond the current, somewhat shallow "campaign rules" (which seem to add challenge but not much else).

For example, it would be neat if the meta-game would include include a map showing where each quest takes place.  You'd put your token on that map to provide a visual indicator of your progress through a cycle (and the campaign).  As you start each new quest, you'd read set of quest-specific instructions in the "meta-manual" (or "campaign manual").  And here's where it gets interesting.

For one thing, I like the idea of having to "earn" new player cards by beating quests.  This could tie into the difficulty quite nicely.  For example, maybe if you beat a quest in Easy Mode, you earn 1 copy of a new player card.  If you beat it in Normal Mode, you earn 2 copies.  And if you beat Nightmare Mode you earn all 3 copies.  So, you can either beat Easy Mode multiple times (which is ideal for people learning the game), or try to "blitz" through the campaign in Nightmare Mode (ideal for experts).

I also think it would be interesting if the campaign would force certain decks on you at times.  For example, imagine if the campaign forces you to play Conflict at the Carrock with a Hobbit-themed deck.  Or maybe you get more rewards for beating a quest with certain deck constraints.  And here's the interesting thing: the deck constraints don't necessarily have to make the quest HARDER.  They can actually be a way to teach you different styles of decks.

Also, the campaign could rebalance some of the notorious quests.  For example, it could direct you to play "Escape from Dul Guldur" one-handed, but with 4 hero cards instead of 3.  This would make that quest beatable solo, and since this instruction would be "official", it wouldn't feel like "cheating".

And between each quest there could be a nice set of narration and illustrations (deeping the immersion), and perhaps also some tips and FAQs (some general, some pertaining to the quest).  This sort of meta-information would make the "campaign book" act a bit like the "casual companion" book idea I mentioned several years ago:

And, while they're at it, they could include copies of any errata'ed cards in the campaign pack, so that we can swap out our old cards for the corrected ones and not have to remember which cards have which errata. 

Do you see what I'm getting at here? 

A well-planned campaign pack would be a huge boon, providing the following:

- a deeper story
- a better sense of geography (via a cool looking map)
- a tangible reward for beating a quest (access to new player cards and advancement on the map)
- a natural way to reward higher difficulties (while encouraging newer players to stick with a quest longer, gaining familiarity with it)
- an introduction to different types of deck builds we might not normally use (ideal for teaching)
- a genuinely fun incentive for people to buy more (or possibly ALL) of the packs, thus ensuring long-term health of the game

Did you notice this little tidbit in FFG's recent State of the LCG post?

Personally, while it would clearly be cool, I hope that any campaign expansion remains optional (in the fashion of the Sagas). The essentially required nature of campaign play in most of AHLCG was one of the reasons I didn't delve into it further. One of the appeals of LotR to me is matching player deck(s) and a quest on a whim and seeing how I do—a mandatory campaign limits the scope of doing that.
