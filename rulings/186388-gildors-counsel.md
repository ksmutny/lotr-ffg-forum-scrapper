# [Gildor&#039;s Counsel](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186388-gildors-counsel/)

Does Gildor's Counsel reduce all card reveals by 1 (to a minimum of one) for the entire quest phase or just staging. For example say in a 2 player game I play Gildor's Counsel. 1 card is revealed instead of 2. Then enough progress is made to advance to the next quest card. The next quest card reads "when revealed: reveal one card per player" it is technically still the quest phase so would those 2 cards be reduced by 1 as well?

Not that this was really in doubt, but @GrandSpleen [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/177891-grandspleen/] was correct:



> [Gildor’s Counsel] will not prevent the surge keyword from triggering and being resolved.
