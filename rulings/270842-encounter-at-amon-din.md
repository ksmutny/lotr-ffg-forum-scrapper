I just got this scenario and I'm having a lot of fun with it! But I came to an interesting result. After I finished the quest, I had 10 villagers on each objective. Rescued villagers says you win if you have more tokens on it than on Dead villagers. Dead villagers says the opposite. So what happens if there's a tie?

Got a response back from Caleb...

Personally if I'm playing and this happens I'm considering it a loss strictly from a thematic standpoint. It doesn't seem right in the end to meet with the orcs in the center of the village while it's all burning around us and shake their hand and say, "Well, lets agree to disagree."
