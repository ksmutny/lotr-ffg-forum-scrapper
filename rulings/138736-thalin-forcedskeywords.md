Hi all,

 

despite this situation has been chewed on many times I still get confused by what exactly happens. So therefore this topic with some examples such that I get it correct from now on. I'll describe how I interpret the situation and if I'm wrong please tell me. All situations are pretty similar from a certain point of view, but I thought it was useful if others read this threat the situation they triggered is covered.

 

My understanding of the rulings tell me that the priority is as follows:

 

Passive Text > Forced (+When Revealed, Keywords) > Responses. 

 

Situation 1: Thalin vs Eastern Crows

Because Thalin is committed to the quest, he will kill the eastern crows before the surge Keyword triggers. Secondary the forced of Eastern crows will not be triggered because the passive text outruns him. So despite the crows are the destroyed, the Forced will not trigger because it is secondary in priority and will never be reached.

 

This seems very strange to me but if I follow the priority scheme this seems the correct interpretation.

 

Situation 2: Thalin vs Goblin Archer

The players don't have to deal damage for the archer, because it's forced is not triggered.

 

Situation 3: Thalin vs Crazed Captive

The players don't have to raise their threat by 7, nor does the Doomed 1 trigger.Maybe not that bad to run the dwarf to prevent this incredible raise.

 

Situation 4: Thalin vs Toughness

Despithe the Uruk-Hai tracker having the Toughness Keyword he will still suffer the damage of Thalin, next to that it is also possible to kill these enemies with toughness when combined with Expecting Mischief.

 

Conclusion:

Despite there are no Eastern Crow loops possible in Journey down the Anduin, that first sting of Thalin seems to be very efficient weapon against all other kind of malice. Nothing is as fast as Thalin and therefor nothing gets triggered either. I really think it is somewhat strange myself but if you just follow the priority rules it looks like it works like this. Any confirmation or explanation if I'm wrong would be nice. 

 

Greetings,

Jban

So its all within the exact wording of the keyword ? If the keyword is worded as a "when enters play" Thalin will shut it down and otherwise it will still be resolved? At least it's an explanation I can work with. Thanks a lot!! I'll go through my keywords then and then I'm ready to go. I didn't know how to solve all, so therefor always picked the worst case. But since this wasn't consistent on the first 2 situations I had to ask it in here to be sure.

 

Still somewhat confused upon the crow loop, since I meant I read some Caleb answer to this on Boardgamegeek, that's it not possible. Probably some mistake, or a revised statement. (Some reply to this is still welcome)

Thanks,

Jban
