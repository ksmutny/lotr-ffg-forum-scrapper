How does Elwing's Flight work, if you can only ready one character but you have a copy of Elwing's Flight in your discard pile?

> I guess things like Lure of Moria with "all" characters are interpreted as not being a single effect but rather a collection of effects and so follow the We Are Not Idle rule of "you can resolve the ones you can resolve and ignore the ones you can't". This is why I'd imagine that Elwing's Flight can be used on the same character several times.

 

Lure of Moria does still have an effect even if you have no Dwarf Characters. It resolves by readying 0 characters. It may seem odd, but they've ruled that "all" can be 0 before. But if the card said "Ready a Dwarf character" and you had no Dwarves, you couldn't play it, because "a" cannot be 0.

I would say 4 as well. This is a ruling from Caleb on whether you have to pay extra for recalling an event with a Record if Heavy Curse is in play:

Now, he does't go on to specify where the event card is when you are resolving its effects, but without some indication that it gets put into some sort of limbo mode, I would assume it's still in your discard.
