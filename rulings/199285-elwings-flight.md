How does Elwing's Flight work, if you can only ready one character but you have a copy of Elwing's Flight in your discard pile?

> I guess things like Lure of Moria with "all" characters are interpreted as not being a single effect but rather a collection of effects and so follow the We Are Not Idle rule of "you can resolve the ones you can resolve and ignore the ones you can't". This is why I'd imagine that Elwing's Flight can be used on the same character several times.

 

Lure of Moria does still have an effect even if you have no Dwarf Characters. It resolves by readying 0 characters. It may seem odd, but they've ruled that "all" can be 0 before. But if the card said "Ready a Dwarf character" and you had no Dwarves, you couldn't play it, because "a" cannot be 0.

I would say 4 as well. This is a ruling from Caleb on whether you have to pay extra for recalling an event with a Record if Heavy Curse is in play:

Now, he does't go on to specify where the event card is when you are resolving its effects, but without some indication that it gets put into some sort of limbo mode, I would assume it's still in your discard.

I don't know if the Heavy Curse/Record attachments ruling is relevant here.  The ruling for that says "It is still in your discard pile at the time you must pay its cost..."

 

It isn't entirely clear where cards go after you've paid their cost as previously mentioned in this thread (regardless of whether they are played from your hand or discard pile or somewhere else.

 

Here is the quote from the rule book regarding events:

 

> An event card is played from a player’s hand, its text effects are resolved, and the card is then placed in its owner’s discard pile.

 

1.  You pay the cost for the Elwing's Flight in your discard pile via the record attachment

2.  You resolve its effects (unfortunately we don't know how to exactly resolve Elwing's Flight in this example because of the ambiguity of where the event is)

3.  You place the event in the discard pile.

 

It does seem that event cards enter a an unidentified limbo state.  Otherwise, as was also mentioned, you would be able to discard Daeron's Runes when you triggered its effect which seems wrong to me.

So, Daerons Runes means it doesn't make sense for it to be in your hand when resolving it.

 

And the Hama/Quick Strike ruling means it isn't in your discard until it's done resolving.

 

So I guess a limbo state is necessary?

It seems so, but I don't think we can declare it with 100% certainty.  It seems odd that it isn't mentioned in the rules explicitly if it does indeed exist.  It's also just as possible that they forgot to include mentioning it as it may not have been relevant initially.

 

Theoretically, it could be "in play" but I think we have received rulings that events are not "in play".  Is it true that we have received such a ruling?  If we have, then are there any other options as to where the card could be other than an undesignated limbo area.

So .. the card is better than i thought :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So ... with Calebs ruling, it is possible to play "We Are Not Idle" without a dwarf character and draw one card?
