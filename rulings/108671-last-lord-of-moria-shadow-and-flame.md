Quest Points: 1

Side 3B: When Revealed: Durin's Bane makes an immediate attack on the first player. Add Dark Pit to the staging area.

Players cannot win the game while Durin's Bane is in play. If Durin's Bane leaves play by the effect on Dark Pit, the players have won the game.

My question is: if I use the effect of Dark Pit, I win the game immediatly even if I don't have the only quest point requested in this quest or I need to put 1 progress token on the quest?

Thank you in advance

O Elbereth wouldn't work, the word "cannot" is absolute so Elbereth can't take Durin's Bane out of the staging area.

 

Of course, by the same logic, Dark Pit also can't remove the balrog from play... so as you might imagine, this question has been asked before and here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/68756-durins-bane-dark-pit-oeg-sf-spoilers/] is the thread with the official response.  I'll copy it below too:

 

Durin's Bane cannot leave the staging area, so O Elbereth! Gilthonial! will not send it to the bottom of the encounter deck. This does create a problem with the text on Dark Pit. That card will receive an erratum in the next FAQ to explain that its ability supersedes the game text on Durin's Bane, making it possible for players to defeat the scenario the way it was intended. In the meantime, please play the scenario as if the last line of Dark Pit reads "This effect supersedes the game text on Durin's Bane."
Thanks,
Caleb

 

 

And as far as I can see, that errata never happened.
