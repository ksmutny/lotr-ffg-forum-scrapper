Just a small rule clarification from Caleb.

Nothing fancy, turns out this is how I played it, but I guess this might worth sharing in case someone's wondering:

 

I'm playing the Black Riders/the Road Darkens.
The One Ring [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-black-riders/the-one-ring-tbr] is not exhausted.
The Ring Draws Them (BR) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-black-riders/the-ring-draws-them-tbr] is revealed from the encounter deck.

Is it possible to cancel its effects and shuffle it into the encounter deck using Frodo Baggins (BR) [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-black-riders/frodo-baggins-tbr] response, considering it requires exhausting the One Ring [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-black-riders/the-one-ring-tbr] ?
What is the correct timing sequence here ?

 

> Great question. Since Frodo’s ability requires you to exhaust The One Ring in order to cancel the effects of an encounter card just revealed, you cannot use it to cancel The Ring Draws Them. You could initiate the Response, but at the time that you would actually cancel the treachery’s effect, the Ring would be exhausted and the effect on The Ring Draws Them would protect it.
