With nothing to do while waiting Shadow and Flame and The Hobbit saga expansion I thought it would be a fun exercise to postulate on some cards for what I am calling "The Shire" cycle after The Hobbit saga expansion.  So I dont have any rules really for this cycle other than try to stick to the Shire, Arnor, and Grey Havens, and basically the west geographically.

 

I'll start with a card I would very much like to see:

Hero:

Farmer Maggot (Lore? Maybe Tactics)

Farmer

Threat 7, Will 1, Att 1, Defense 1

Text: While Farmer Maggot is the defending character any Nazgul's Att is reduced to 0.

No attachments except Fang, Grip and Wolf.

Attachment:

Fang (Cost 1or 2)

Creature

Text: Attach to Farmer Maggot only.  While attached Farmer Maggot gets +1 Att.

If Fang and Grip and Wolf are attached Fang provides Farmer Maggot with a total +2 Att.

Grip

Creature

Text: Attach to Farmer Maggot only.  While attached Farmer Maggot gets +1 Will.

If Fang and Grip and Wolf are attached Grip provides +1 Will and Farmer Maggot does not exhaust to quest.

Wolf

Creature

Text: Attach to Farmer Maggot only.  While attached Farmer Maggot gets +1 Def.

If Fang and Grip and Wolf are attached Wolf provides +1 Def and Sentinel.

 

 

What do you think?

What are your ideas for "Shire" cards?

Good ideas for cards. I like the suggestions for Maggot and his dogs, the Old Forest, Bombadil (who I would LOVE to see), and "missions" rather than quests (similar to the ones in LOTRO). I think "missions would work well for a cycle in the Shire, although I would worry that a "lighter" cycle might alienate some players and depart too much from the core mechanics of the game. I'm interested in others' thoughts on the last point…

 

 

thats a good point - i think the bilbo type players would love it (i certainly would) pippins would be on the fence and boromirs would hate it. perhaps theres a comprimise somwhere between lightheartedness and peril- places like the downs and old forest are like this i think

or perhaps the first two could be light hearted in the middle of the shire and the other 4 could steadily get more dangerous [added]- that progression would be very faithful to the books

Great idea! I hope Caleb reads these…
