I remember I was rooting for a Smeagol hero long ago.

A lot to go over with this. Overall, I'm extremely happy and excited for this announcement. Biggest news for me is we're finally getting a One Ring player card, and it seems to be fitting and powerful. Gollum hero also is another thing I was waiting for, and more importantly it signals Caleb's willingness to cover some of the dark themes that have been missing for years in this game. Here's hoping the Rhun/East cycle finally brings some of my most expected characters, namely hero Saruman and the Blue Wizards. Also, this new Master keyword could be some sort of Doomed reboot I was waiting for for a true Artifact theme/subarchetype. Here's hoping Caleb expands on the "magic", "arts of the Enemy" doom-y artifacts themes during this cycle, as it would fit it perfectly. The expansion itself, the art and story all excite me quite a bit (love the wild ox reference in the River Running art, as it was from hte wild oxen of Rhun that the Horn of Gondor was taken). Can't be more glad for this game, and now I'm more certain than ever that right now it's the best it's ever been.

I'm torn on this one.

Yesterday, I would have told you that the absolute worst thing you could do for this game (short of making Orc playable characters on the hero's side, perhaps) was to introduce a One Ring player card outside of the Saga expansions. I never really thought about Smeagol as an option, but if I had, it would not have been far behind on the list of worst things you could do.

Frankly, as of yesterday, I would have rather had the game end than introduce these player cards to the game.

But, I trust Caleb. I trust his design instincts, and I trust that just like he came around to a different point of view, so can I. I hope so, at least. The spoiled cards so far seem to indicate that he's taking the appropriate amount of care and thought with this. I hope the final product that emerges at the end of the cycle is a game as true to Tolkien's vision of his world as the game was as of yesterday.

Super excited for this. I'm a big fan of being able to play "what if" decks, so I'm happy that Caleb and any other designers adding their input to the game have come around to the idea of giving us an Arkenstone, a One Ring, a Sting, even though their location is known to us at the time our game is set.  You have the freedom to build thematic decks, but having the freedom to also build wildly off-canon decks is also appealing to me and keeps the game fresh.

Also, I do love Gollum as a character, and have been wanting him as a playable card for a long time.  I love his design.  Amazed by the 3 threat!  

I like the fist Master card that we've seen.  Now you have some cancellation in any sphere you wish.  Plop that into a tactics deck, cancel a location and hope for an enemy to replace it.

Well, I don't think Caleb sat down with a marketing intern and said, "Hey, this hero is coming out in an AP next cycle, and the other one is coming out in the following cycle, so be EXTRA careful to use a plural here, OK?"

I know often all we have as evidence is what FFG puts on its site, but I caution reading too much into the words where the marketing department is concerned, as they have repeatedly gotten things across multiple game lines wrong. (I also think a starter set that didn't cost $100 might very well count as "standard", but that's neither here nor there.)

I also don't think Caleb sat down and invented two brand-new heroes for a product that otherwise contained exactly zero new player cards.  It makes much more practical sense to borrow two heroes that have already been playtested for a future cycle or cycles.  Now it's *possible* for two yet-to-be-released heroes to be in the same deluxe, but as Thorin and Gildor have nothing in common and never met (that we know), that doesn't fit the pattern for past deluxes:  two dwarves, two Gondorians, two Rohirrim, two Dunedain, two Noldor, Legolas & Gimli, two Dale.  So even if FFG had said nothing at all, I'd expect both heroes to be released in separate, regular products.  As they said exactly that, I see little reason to hedge on my expectations.

While I recognize that FFG releases aren't authoritative, the way the new heroes are portrayed in the article (brand new, but coming eventually in standard products) is different than the way the new quests are portrayed in the article (brand new and unique).  I think the starter set *should* be released by FFG as a regular product, but there's been no hint from FFG that they will do so.

Since past deluxes *do* have links between their hero, who could be released with Gollum in the next deluxe?  I'm betting on a new version of Frodo or Sam.

Can't agree with you more. I've learned through several talks that Asmodee pretty much runs the website marketing. Caleb may not even get the chance to really look at the articles or have any say to edit the article before it's released. Please don't punish Caleb! 

 

 

Remember! You're just playing your "version" of what happens between the books. What if Boromir DID find the ring and take it for Gondor? What if Aragorn or Galdriel did see themselves as capable enough to bear the burden?

I honestly can't say. I think I heard it hear or on the Facebook page. To my memory, it was attributed to Caleb, but I may honestly been totally mistaken. Nobody else seems to know about this, so it's more than possible that it was never said and that I'm simply remembering incorrectly.

There is a hint in one of the designer journals:

Q: If you could do one thing to improve the game experience, what would it be?

Caleb: Campaign play has been very successful and well-received with the saga expansions. Lately I’ve been thinking quite a bit about how we might be able to do more with that idea.

I'm not totally crazy!😂😂😂

Just to add another perspective on the "final cycle" nonsense arguments: A few people have said that Mordor (if we're going there, which we may well not be) would be a good place to set the final cycle (which this almost certainly isn't). But personally I think it's much more likely that, not knowing for sure how long the game will run, if Caleb has cool ideas for a cycle that goes to Mordor (or Rhun, or anywhere else), he's just going to do them. He's not going to postpone those ideas specifically to make sure they end up being the last things he makes, he's just going to get them out there so everyone can enjoy them sooner rather than later.

Caleb giving us cool stuff is not evidence the game is dying, it's evidence Caleb has cool stuff for us to enjoy.
