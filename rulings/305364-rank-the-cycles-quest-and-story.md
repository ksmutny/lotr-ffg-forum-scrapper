So I'm trying to figure out where to go back into the game after a break. I'm halfway through Harad, but so far the story and quests haven't really appealed to me. So, how do you rank the cycles you've played? Ignoring the player cards entirely. I have enough player cards to try out new decks, but I'm looking for the best quests in the game.

Â 

Here's my list:

1. Angmar Awakened (Favorite part of the lore, likeable allies, fun diverse quests, satisfying bossfight)

2. Dream-chaser (Innovative sailing mechanics, pirates themed, dissapointing reveal of the mystery)

3. Khazad-Dum (Feels very much like Moria, very close to the books, repeats the same story within the cycle, bs treachery's)

4 Against the shadow (Some really cool quests, some boring ones, annoying mono-sphere treachery's)

5 Haradrim (I'm only up to the second AP, nothing stoot out for me so far, does it get better?)

6 Shadows of Mirkwood (Early development questionable design but also fun and memorable, Anduin still holds up as one of the best)

7 Ring Maker (Story didn't grap me as cool as helping Saruman is, SO MANY COUNTERS AND TRIGGERS, such a mental chore to play)

8 Hobbit Saga (Thematic at the cost of fun quest design, too gimicky)

Â 

Unranked:

LotR saga, Ered Mithril, Vengance of Mordor

In my opinion, as a mix of mechanics, theme and fun I would rank them as such:

1) Ered Mithrin
2) LOTR Saga
3) Dreamchaser
4) Angmar Awakened
5) Harad
6) Ringmaker
7) Shadows of Mirkwood
8 ) Dwarrovdelf
9) Against the Shadow
10) Hobbit Saga

Keeping in mind that we always played them as a 4 players group.

In general I feel confident in saying that the overall quality (both mechanical and narrative) of the quests has only been increasing lately, as Caleb's grasp of the game and quality of writing improved over the years. That's why I have very high expectations for Vengeance of Mordor (I still have to get Wrath and Ruin ðŸ˜¢)

1) Against the Shadow: first real narrative of the game, and quite plausible, I like all quests, even with the Battle/SIege questing which is not too annoying with a modern day cardpool.

2) Angmar Awaneked: both the narrative and the quests are close to perfection. I rank it behind Against the Shadow because I'm a Gondor fanboy, but if I were a bit more impartial, this would be first.

3) Ered Mithrin: Fram+Beowulf narrative is really good but a few quests were a bit of a let down for me (Ghost of Framsburg, Roam Across Rhovanion)

4) The LOTR Saga: nuff said. It's only 4th because a few quest are kinda "meh" (Road to Isengard, all the Land of Shadow box, the Siege of Gondor). if it were just for the Black Riders augmented with Fog on the Barrow Downs and The Old Forest, I would rank it even the Angmar Awakened cycle.

5) Shadows of Mirkwood: following Aragorn's chase in the appendix was a clever idea, but the game was too young to really make it shine like it could have. The Nightmare version helps a bit bettering the cycle.

6) Dream-Chaser: really cool narrative even if on a weird stance with the jungles, grottos and all those undeads, but all quests are really fun, innovative and well balanced

7) Haradrim: unmemorable narrative in my opinion, ok quests

8 ) The Hobbit: first quests designed by Caleb, so they're not perfect, but I like them, especially the second box

9) Ring-Maker: those Time tokens and mechanics were just dead annoying. Too bad because the narrative covers so many things about Saruman pre-LOTR (forging of its ring, designing the uruk-hai and aligning the Dunlendings)

Â 

==> this concludes the first part of my list. Obviously it's too early to rate Vengeance of the Mordor cycle, but it would probably be on par with Ered Mithrin cycle. Anything below rank 3) was actually hard to rank, so that's why I'm taking a pause here. Because, yes Ring-Maker is 9, and Dwarrowdelf is 10, but Ring-Maker is infinitely better. So I will be finishing with:

Â 

10) Dwarrowdelf: non-sensical narrative (contradicting heavily with lore) that gets repeated twice (the saga scenario "Journey in the Dark" is more than enough to cover Moria, thanks). Most quests have a poor design and an overly thick encounter deck. Probably the worst batch of player cards. Both the two-powerful-onesÂ that unbalanced the game for years (Glorfindel+LoV+Asfaloth)Â and the actual worst one is from this cycle (The End Comes). Oh, and Sleeping Sentry. Dumbest card in the game. Worst player card and encounter card of the game.
