Yesterday I was reading through the UT book and I want to bring up a discussion that started a while back.

Does FFG have a license to things in UT?

We have seen Khamûl the Easterling in the Saga expansion Nightmare pack. Khamul is only named in the UT book. This would lead to suggest yes. They could also just bought Khamûl, and not a whole license.

Why FFG should get a license if they don't have one yet:

The Blue Wizards are named in UT in the essay on the Istari. Also in the Silmarillion, but I doubt anyone ever getting a license for the S. Many people including me would love to see them represented in the game.

The Battles of the Fords of the Isen are in UT. As suggested in another thread: good expansion material.

A lot of information about the Palantíri is in UT. Some people have been dieing for a 'better' palantir/ not a general palantir card but unique ones.

But the best thing I will quote:

''For with the consent of Eru they sent members of their own high order [...]. Of this Order the number is UNKNOWN; but of those that came to the North of Middle-earth,[...], the chiefs were five.

This suggested that their are more Istari in our 'playregion'. (FFG invented Istari!) :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

To come back to my question:

Does anybody know if FFF has a license or how to find out?

> As I understand it, the rights for The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are owned by Saul Zaentz.  Everything else is owned by the Tolkein estate.  (Read: Christopher Tolkein)  We would have never had the movies and maybe not even the games if Christopher Tolkein had his say.

In one of the community interviews with Caleb he mentioned how the company worked fairly closely with the Tolkien Estate.
