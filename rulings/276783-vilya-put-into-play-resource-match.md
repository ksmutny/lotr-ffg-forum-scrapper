My friend and I were discussing In Seastan's The One Deck how he is getting steward of Gondor in play without resource match.  I offered that when putting things into play  maybe you ignore resource match, he wasn't so sure.  Is there a place in the rules that addresses this?  Thanks.

Vilya is a complicating card. From the FAQ (https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/2e/31/2e3129b3-dc51-4c27-81ed-6a72f13e82f3/lotr_faq_19.pdf [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/2e/31/2e3129b3-dc51-4c27-81ed-6a72f13e82f3/lotr_faq_19.pdf]

So no resource match is required for any card.

From Caleb:

> A: When you use Vilya’s ability and the top card of your deck is an ally or attachment, you put it into play. The added language about “play at no cost” is there for when the top card of your deck is an event, because you don’t put events into play.

So the text "at no cost" on Vilya is the important factor here. Because if it just said "You can immediately play or put into play the revealed card." then you would have to have a resource match for events (since you play them) but not allies/attachments (since you put them into play).

Vilya's "no cost" text also applies to additional costs, such as the one of Skyward Volley. It also bypasses play restrictions on attachments like Ent Draught (since you aren't "playing" it) but not play restrictions on events like Strength of Arms (since you are "playing" it). This was all discussed here: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204958-vilya-and-ent-draught/?do=findComment&amp;comment=2094740 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204958-vilya-and-ent-draught/?do=findComment&comment=2094740]
