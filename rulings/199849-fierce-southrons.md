When fierce Southrons forces one enemy in the straging area to make an immediate attack, can other player defend this attack with centinel?

My doubt is because it has the Peril keyword.

Other questions similar: can other player kill the enemy during the attack, for example, with Hands-upon-the-Bow?

The question I asked: 

Greetings! With regards to the peril keyword and the treachery card "Fierce Southrons" - if the option is chosen where "each enemy in the staging area makes an immediate attack against you", can your team mates use their sentinel characters to block for you? The rule for peril is: When a player reveals an encounter card with the Peril keyword, he must resolve the staging of that card on his own without conferring with the other players. The other players cannot take any actions or trigger any responses during the resolution of that card's staging. Thanks

 

The response I got:

The peril keyword prevents other players from interrupting the staging of Fierce Southrons, but once the attack has been initiated the staging is done. When an enemy makes an attack outside of the combat phase, you observe all the steps of ‘resolving enemy attacks’ and the action windows between each step. So, it is possible for another player to declare a sentinel character as the defender and to take actions in-between those steps.

Cheers,
