For example. A hero (with a weapon attached) attacks and destroys an enemy.

Scenario 1: Can I play two Foe-Hammers from my hand for the same single enemy that was destroyed? 

Scenario 2: I play Foe-Hammer and draw 3 cards. Say the third card is another copy of Foe-Hammer. Can I play that one as well in light of the same enemy that was destroyed earlier?

Scenario 3:  I play Foe-Hammer and draw 3 cards. Say the third card is a Daeron's Runes. I play DR and draw 2 more cards the second of which is another copy of Foe-Hammer. Can I play that copy of Foe-Hammer in light of the same enemy that was destroyed earlier?

It was clarified that cards that weren't on the table when the trigger occurred can't activate their Response to that trigger (e.g. character leaves play, quest card says "Forced: After a character leaves play, reveal an encounter card", and you reveal an enemy with "Forced: After a character leaves play raise your threat by 1; you don't raise your threat by 1). I didn't ask what that meant for the old ruling about cards you just drew, because I didn't want Caleb to take away our toys.

Edit: similar case where responses don't trigger: if a response to trigger X causes a card to acquire new text that also has a response to trigger X, the new response does not trigger. Example: A card with "Forced: When a character leaves play, attach to a hero. Counts as a condition attachment with the text 'Forced: when a character leaves play, raise your threat by 1.'" The first time a character leaves play, you attach the card as a condition, but do not trigger the threat increase.

Just to mention: I lost the email unfortunately, but some time after this discussion, I asked Caleb to confirm Nate's old Valiant Sacrifice chain ruling (http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications/#entry4469 [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications/#entry4469]). Caleb reiterated that yes, you can indeed play a VS you just drew from a prior VS (even though the 2nd VS did not "see" the triggering condition).

I still find this weird, but hey.
