Good day traveler's of Middle-earth! This is Gwaihir, Lord of the Winds, with yet another video play-through for your viewing pleasure. Today's video continues the saga expansion in the Road Darkens with the second scenario, Journey in the Dark. For now on, I will post all future updates to this thread.

This is interesting indeed, Mr. Beorn. You are right in saying that the rules say nothing about limiting keywords to a single word. It just seems to imply that in my opinion. We should get an official ruling on what are keywords from Caleb and crew.

I think the phrase 'loses all keywords' in plural was deliberate to allow future design space (think Caleb says this in an interview or question somewhere) i.e. the designers didn't want to limit the space. However, I don't have a link, or the time to hunt it down...

 

As I understand it, a keyword has to be described as such in a rulebook or insert, and Immune to player card effects is never described in this way. I would *love* the opportunity to use some interest player card effects (not necessarily Feint) on the Balrog, as otherwise it's all about brute strength in your attack column to kill it. No subtlety.

There's an official ruling quoted in this thread: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1251736/balrog-keywords-and-great-bridge [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1251736/balrog-keywords-and-great-bridge]

Summary: the only keyword on the Balrog is "indestructible".
