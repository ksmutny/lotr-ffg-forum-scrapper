The Fires of Industry

Announcing the sixth Adventure Pack in the Vengeance of Mordor cycle 

"Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-earth. The old world will burn in the fires of industry. Forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the tractor." - Thane Ulchor

After rescuing the prisoners from their fierce Easterling enslavers, you have finally reached Thane Ulchor's stronghold.  As you draw near to his fortress of Dol Rhugar, however, you have come across something you did not expect: Thane Ulchor is breeding an army, with a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. But this army is not comprised of anything you have come across before. Thane Ulchor is forging an army of sentient tractors, preparing to plow over all of Middle-Earth.

Bobbymcbobface is happy to announce The Fires of Industry, the sixth and final Adventure Pack in the Vengeance of Mordor cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game! Beginning after you rescue the prisoners in The Land of Sorrow, this 60-card Adventure Pack pits your party against fierce intelligent tractors and their fell allies in the final epic showdown of the final cycle of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game! Can you save Middle-Earth?

Battle of the Ages

The end of your journey has arrived. Your journeys have led you from Thranduil's palace, through Moria, through many battles in the realm of Gondor, to Isengard and Dunland, to the lost realm of Arnor, as far away as the fabled ruins of Númenor, to the blistering sand of Harad, to the wilds of Rhovanion, and finally through Rhûn and Mordor to this final clash. 

In this quest, a new mechanic, representing the overwhelming forces of the tractors of Mordor, is introduced. The Tractor Deck is comprised of 10 Tractor cards, some enemies, and some tractor treachery attachments, which enter play through various card effects. The Tractor of Mordor, for example, will plow allies under wheel if the players do not take it down soon enough.

Haha, I’m just seeing this ... nicely done.
 

But no, I think Caleb’s mic drop on the final scenario will be going full on “The Third Age” rpg and having our heroes climb Barad-Dur to physically assault the flaming eye of Sauron.
