I was pondering this question during one of the many "the game is dying threads". Is there a point where you would WANT the game to die? There's only so many places and characters in Tolkien's legendarium.

Personally I don't mind some ffg characters but if the game becomes MOSTLY ffg original material the game will be done for me. I'll still play what I have but I won't buy anymore.

How about you guys?

Would you be willing to go to entire regions that are made up?

Would you play if an entire cycle had no canon characters?

Would you play if they started releasing material that directly contradicted stuff in the source material?

As long as the game still has the feel of Middle Earth, I will keep buying and playing, no matter what characters FFG makes up. One of the amazing things that Caleb and Matt have done with most of their made up characters is they give them backstories and make them feel like they belong in Middle Earth. As long as they keep doing that (and I dont see them stoping anytime soon) I'll keep playing and buying.

I agree with this totally. One of the things I love about this game are the elements that Caleb and Matt make up or explore in a "non canonical" way but are sourced enough in the lore to make me go look things up and learn more about the lore.

Also, I wouldn't mind having copies of most of the main named characters across all of the spheres, with game abilities fitting to each sphere while still being rooted in the source material.
