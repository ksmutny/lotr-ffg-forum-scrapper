Hi Matthew,
Good question. You can play attachments on locations that are immune to player card effects. If a card cannot have attachments, then it will read "Cannot have attachments." However, cards that are immune to player card effects will be immune to the abilities of attachments. So you can play Power in the Earth on the Troll Cave, but it will have no effect on that location. Card like Ancient Mathom and Path of Need work differently because they don't affect the location, so their abilities will still work.
Thanks for asking,
Caleb

I've had a reply from Caleb and then a quick email exchange to confirm my understanding.

First reply from Caleb

Smaug's immunity does not affect shadow cards, it only protects him from card effects. Burning brand targets the shadow cards and not Smaug, so it still works. The +1 defense from Dunedain Warning modifies the attached character, not Smaug, so it still works. An example of cards that wouldn't work against his immunity to card effects would be Radagast's Cunning or Feint because they try to modify Smaug.


 

I then asked

In the Hobbit expansion it defines the term "immune to player card effects" as.
Cards with the text "immune to player card effects" ignore the effects of all player cards. Additionally, cards that are immune to player card effects cannot be chosen as targets of player card effects

If I've understood you correctly, the first sentence isn't correct. Smaug doesn't ignore the effects of all player cards. If he did, he would ignore the effects of a Dunedain warning on a defender. Actually he only ignores the effects of player cards that would directly affect him.
So Rivendell blade won't lower his defense, Mirkwood runner will not get around his defense and Heavy Stroke can't add more damage to him because they would all affect him and he is immune to those effects.
Dunedain warning on a defender affects how much damage the defender will take and therefore is not ignored as it doesn’t affect Smaug, it affects the defender.

If I've got that right then a clearer definition could be

Player card effects can neither target nor affect cards with the text "immune to player card effects".

Is that right?
 

And the reply was

What you described in your example accurately describes how Smaug's immunity interacts with the game.

I'm happy that I now understand the term and even though Caleb didn't comment on my updated definition of the term I will be using it from now on when interacting with Smaug (and Beorn).

Player card effects can neither target nor affect cards with the text "immune to player card effects".
