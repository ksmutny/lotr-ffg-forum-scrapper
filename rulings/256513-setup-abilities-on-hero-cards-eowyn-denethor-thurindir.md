Together, their threat is 21 (9+12), but Eowyn's setup allows for a 3 threat reduction (21-3=18). After using her ability and other things, it becomes time to use Lore Aragorn's Refresh Action. Does threat go back to 21 or 18?

The initial threat is set before using TaEowyn's ability so her reduction is not taken into account by LoAragorn ability.

But let's say that right now there is lot of uncertainty about triggering Setup abilities, since the Contract introduction. We are trying to get some clarity from Caleb, but your case should not be influenced.

I will agree to that statement...I had asked another question before in regards to using Messenger of the King and seeing if I could give Spirit Ally Bilbo turned Hero The One Ring and there was dispute of what happens first I believe...I personally want to play it as such that I can do it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It would be nice to define a list of what happens:

As you suggest, do we 1) place heroes, 2) set initial threat, 3) do hero setups...In this case initial threat would be 21, but threat before play begins is 18...technically no different than playing an Elrond's Council during the Action window of the Resource phase (if you had a Spirit hero and Noldor hero in play).

Or do we look at it as 1) place heroes, if any hero has setup then it acts as interrupt, 2) set threat...In this case initial threat would be 18.

Well right now (by Caleb's debated last rulings) you place heroes and set initial threat in Step 2 of the Setup and resolve Setup abilities (of heroes and other player cards) in Step 7 after doing the quest Setup.
