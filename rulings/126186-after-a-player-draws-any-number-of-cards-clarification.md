In the case of a card like "Hithaeglir Foothills - The Dunland Trap", which gains one resource "after a player draws any number of cards", is this 2 resources during the draw phase because two players drew a card? Or is it just one if players draw simultaniously. Because Hithaeglir Foothills has no cap for instance,when we played it forced the threat in the staging area up to almost twenty, while Stage 3 had another activate location in play so we couldn't travel there, and we were way too burdened with enemies to quest all out. Bit broken if so.

If you're interested, that ruling about Silvan Tracker is in the thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/page-2].
 
You can trigger the Silvan Tracker's ability for each Silvan character that readies during the refresh phase. If 8 Silvan character's ready at the same time, you will trigger the Response 8 times and resolve them one by one.
