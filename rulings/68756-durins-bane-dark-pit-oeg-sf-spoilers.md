# [Durin&#039;s Bane, Dark Pit, OEG [S&amp;F SPOILERS]](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68756-durins-bane-dark-pit-oeg-sf-spoilers/)

 Durin's Bane "cannot leave the staging area" (by its own text).

I presume this means that O Elbereth Gilthoniel will not work on Durin's Bane (since putting DB on the bottom of the encounter deck would involve it "leaving the staging area"). This seems fair enough.

However, the same reasoning suggests that Dark Pit will not work on Durin's Bane, as it "discards DB from play" (= "leaving the staging area). This would obviously be absurd as DP appears to be the way that the quest requires you to overcome Durin's Bane.

Given this, what reason is there to say that OEG does not work on DB, but that Dark Pit does? (other than perceived designer intent, a very poor basis for rulings).

Well, here we have it:

Durin's Bane cannot leave the staging area, so O Elbereth! Gilthonial! will not send it to the bottom of the encounter deck. This does create a problem with the text on Dark Pit. That card will receive an erratum in the next FAQ to explain that its ability supersedes the game text on Durin's Bane, making it possible for players to defeat the scenario the way it was intended. In the meantime, please play the scenario as if the last line of Dark Pit reads "This effect supersedes the game text on Durin's Bane."
Thanks,
