The 1st until the 3rd AP are supposed to be expected in Q2.

So says the almighty upcoming page.

Q2 starts next week, and the 1st AP is still in concept status?

That means: printer + boat ride + shipping = 3 months minimum.

For the 1st pack that is. AP 2 & 3 will not make it to the stores in Q2.

Don't expect the cycle to start before late Q2 (June) or Q3 people....

It's well past concept.  I'd be surprised if Caleb & Co. were not neck deep in the NEXT cycle's design.  You need to think pretty far ahead with this kind of game.  

 

The question I have is: how do they organize the playtesting to make sure they have only the cards they want in the decks for each test?  How much of that testing is done on computers vs. real cards?  Designing while refining while blogging based on a past status of the game sounds like a pretty overwhelming task.
