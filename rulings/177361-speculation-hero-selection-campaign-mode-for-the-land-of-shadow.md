I can't help but wonder as to how they are going to manage hero selection (in campaign mode) when The Land of Shadow comes out.  At a minimum I expect that you can't use Aragorn, Saruman, or Grima in any of your decks. But will they go further and say you cannot use any hero that was used for The Treason of Saruman?  Stands to reason that they cannot be helping out Frodo while also rescuing captives, defending Helm's deep, and confronting Saruman.

 
Let the speculation begin!

Just to toss out an observation: up until the Breaking of the Fellowship, the storyline in the books only follows Frodo's point of view.  While we are free to mix and match precisely who is with Frodo, the saga story so far has been "those heroes who are with Frodo". Starting with the Treason of Saruman we see now have a split focus: those heroes who are with Aragorn vs. those who go with Frodo to Mordor. Any hero who was present at the breaking of the Fellowship could have gone with Aragorn (with the exception of the Ring Bearer), and so that's the option Caleb and team gave us.  There's nothing preventing the designers from saying "By the way, you can't have the same hero choose to follow both Aragorn and Frodo at the same time". 

 

For the records my speculations are

 * we can change heroes in The Land of Shadow without any threat penalty.
 * we won't be allowed to use Aragorn 

 

For my part, I did chose to drop Sam from my team of heroes (and take the threat penalty) just in case they did something really restrictive (and for thematics reasons as well).
