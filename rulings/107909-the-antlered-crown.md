Exciting preview as always!!!

I'll start off with the spirit event which as noted above, appears as though it will add damage to enemies based off of progress when questing which is not only just a fantastic fit in regards to the nature of our current Rohan cards, but an amazing card for spirit in general. It's this kind of creativity that really helps the game when we can help cover the weakness of the sphere while still maintaining it's identity. Caleb and co. are remaining true to their word.

The ents are super exciting as well, the art on the booming ent is magnificent and I can see him being quite the powerhouse especially as we gain more ent characters. In that same vein Tree-beard is a great card too. I'll admit I would have preferred him to be a hero but I love that he's neutral and it seems the designers learned for the limited scope of Radaghast. For the two spheres our ent characters represent: tactics and lore, don't really mesh that well but thankfully with Tree beard you can probably get away with only running one of the two spheres provided u get him out early (using Elrond if u go with lore wouldn't hurt either)

They confirm these are the only ents we'll see in the cycle which makes me wonder when we'll see the previously spoiled art for leaf lock from artist Mike Nash. I figured it would be in his cycle but if it's like Gwaihir it may not be till years down the road. Speaking of ent art from Mike Nash, I have nothing against Treebeard's illustration, infact I think he looks quite regal in his own way. The really great booming ent kind of overshadows him however

Will be cool to see the Rohan hero and how he influences the current archetype but we know too little to bother speculating on him (or her) further

(sorry for the typos, doing this from my phone and there will undoubtedly be some)
