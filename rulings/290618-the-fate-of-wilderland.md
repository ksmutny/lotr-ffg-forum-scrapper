I'm glad to finally see another Istari hero, albeit a bit salty it's no Saruman.

Would be a nice bonus to bring Boromir back power-wise even though mostly helpful in the combat-phase. But could also make it once per round if they would be too strong together, or just make it "after raising your threat from a player card Doomed effect" and you would only lose the Palantir. The latter idea might even be a better fix then he only combos with Grima and the Doomed cards.

Though after recently battling Saruman boss in the saga edition he should be a multi-action powerhouse, chucking spells left and right, playing dangerously close with your threat and doing nothing to drop the threat of your allied players. 

Anyways that's my hope, would be pretty cool to have a team of Saruman/Grima synergizing with Gandalf, Galadrial or Elrond for some Hobbit cinema-verse recreations. Or even just to show what would have happened if Saruman accepted Gandalf's offer and helped against the great enemy. 

We will see what Caleb and FFG do but they have full permission to use this idea as a base haha. I just want to see whatever Saruman comes out, being able to synergize with the Voices of Isenguard cards and especially his ally Grima.

Oh and a final thought, he really needs to have ranged.
