No mention of any Istari character, Doomed keyword, or Artifact makes me sad and worried. Because this would have been, like, THE time to revisit those.

 

Seriously, Caleb and Matt, what's a man gotta do to get a couple Istari heroes, a few magic rings and a couple Seeing-Stones? That's literally all I ask for!

Agree with Bullroarer. I think the theme is quite solid. As he indicated, the quest begins immediately after the conclusion of City of the Corsairs. Narrow Alleyway was one of my favorite cards in the encounter deck. It grants a previously unseen positive effect for a location which later has a drawback. Furthermore, the card is not plentiful, so you have to decide whether you want to use it quickly or save it for an enemy you deem worse. The location cards generally operate on the chase theme when they become the active location - some sort of mechanic will trigger that forces you to engage enemies or remove progress from the main quest. One of the encounter side quests has some new tricks to it as well. Thankfully, I managed to avoid it in the two games I played.

 

The quest concludes with the heroes fleeing out the gates of Umbar and into the desert. That scene segues right into the second quest, which I have not played yet. I usually try to win about 3 games against a non-brutal quest, so I'll likely try Escape from Umbar a couple more times before moving on to Desert Crossing (Quest #2). I did glimpse briefly at the encounter cards for Desert Crossing; the desert-themed artwork looked great! As I mentioned in an earlier post, I was oddly ambivalent about the Harad cycle despite being tolerant of the designers forays into material that could be deemed un-thematic or not holding true to Middle Earth lore. But as I sifted through the encounter cards for Sands, I found myself feeling pretty motivated to play the quests.

 

Just glanced very briefly at The Long Arm of Mordor. It seems to continue the escape/travel theme by having the heroes make their way toward a jungle. I could see this cycle being the reverse of Dream-chaser. In that cycle we were the pursuers. In this, we appear to be the pursued.

 

I got the distinct sense that Matt and Caleb have decided to more strongly connect the narrative for the Deluxe cycles (as we saw at the end of Angmar Awakened and beginning of Dream-chaser). The beginning of Sands certainly seems to continue this approach. I like it.
