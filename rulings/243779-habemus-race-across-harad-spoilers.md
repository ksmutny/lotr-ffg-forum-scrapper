A player in the LOTR LCG FB group has posted this month's player cards spoilers (some of which I am extemely excited about). So, without further adue, here are the as of yet unspoiled cards:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What can I even say. The words Orthanc, Isengard and Doomed in the same card again. I wanted this for so long.

The power of Orthanc cannot be lightly thrown aside indeed... Hoping Caleb learned his lesson from the Ring-maker cycle lol! As for the card, I absolutely love it. Sure, it costs 3 and asks for doomed to draw cards, but with reduction and/or Loragorn the doomed is just gravy. Drawing cards is always really good, especially if you can splash it into whatever event you play, and I'm so glad they gave the doomed themed ally 2 willpower.

Nope, and that's why I hope Caleb gives the Doomed/Isengard/Palantir theme a bit more support so The Seeing-Stone becomes more relevant. And yeah I know technically it doesn't have to be Isengard and Palantir themed. He could just print any random event or ally and give him Doomed and it would help The Seeing Stone (as he did in the Ring-Maker cycle), but I really hope more Doomed cards deal with the themes of Isengard and the dangers of corruption, like this Steward did. It really is to me the direction in which the Doomed keyword should go, theme-wise.
