So i bougth this guest about week ago and me and my friend played it and we had this situatation.

 

We completed stage 2b and it says: After placing the 11th progress token on snowdrifts...Caradhras becomes active location. And caradhras has that While Caradhras is active location, guesting charecters get -1 willpower.

 

So here is my guestion: Does my hero Theodred die because he is still guesting or am i already finished guest phase and then Theodred wouldnt be anymore guesting charecter and he would survive?

 

Oh and i have another one guestion about same guest, so if example northern tracker would have been guested so much that caradhras would leave as an explored location, does i still have to complete it again, when i have been completed stage 2b?

Characters are considered questing until the end of the questing phase.

It's good if you are playing thalin, but in case of Caradhras, it does hurt a bit.

 

Answer from Caleb says it should become the active location even if in victory display because it's a forced effect and cards in victory display are not removed from the game. Expect cries and tears when playing Nightmare Emyn Muil.
