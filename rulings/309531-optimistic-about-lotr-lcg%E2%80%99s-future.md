Anyone else notice that the last 4 announcements on the main page are LOTR related? One for our beloved game, one for JIME, another for the anniversary edition of LOTR The Board Game and the livestream with JIME as it’s cover. 
 

After the long hiatus it’s nice to get a ton of love from FFG. Especially leading up to unto their annual livestream and future products announcement. And with all of the above it seems to me at least like LOTR isn’t as dead as many think it is after this cycle. They obviously recognize that it’s a popular property and are still pushing even the older LOTR games. 
 

Also there was the interview with the head of Asmodee who stated (More or less) that the market was flooded with games and that a focus will be on expanding existing games with established lines. This definitely describes the LCG. 
 

So regardless of what things look like post-break, I’m optimistic that we are going to get more content, and here is hoping for some more campaign material and contracts! 
 

Anyone else pick up on this and have any hopes or thoughts?

Here's some places on Middle Earth not yet visited:

Far Harad

Rhun

Khand

Forochel

IIRC, there was a report that Caleb intended to have the current cycle head East into Rhun and have the following cycle head into Mordor, but those were combined to get him off LOTR and onto Champions sooner.

We already know LOTR LCG is ending with the current cycle.  If the number of forum posts about a game are any indicator, LOTR LCG is certainly the most popular of FFG's LCG's.  Moving Caleb to Marvel Champions was important for FFG to make that game successful.  I'm hoping it will come back in the future in some compatible format, but  with the myriad of layoffs and staff reduction at Asmodee, it's no surprise they are shifting people around to setup different lines.  While Caleb is certainly a huge LOTR fan, you can tell Marvel is where is heart is.  I'm sure he jumped at the chance to develop that game.  Looking to the immediate future, picking up Journeys is probably the way to go for the mean time.  Fortunately, LOTR LCG is ending by FFG's own accord and not due to a loss of license or other form of mismanagement that abruptly ends so many games these days.  Once MC is of the ground, in a year or two we may see LOTR return.
