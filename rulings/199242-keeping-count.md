"Attached hero gets +1 Attack  for each resource token on another copy of Keeping Count that is above the current number of resource tokens on this card."

 

In my last game I had 3 copies of Keeping Count equipped on heroes. Glorfindel had 5 tokens, Elrohir had 3, and Elladan had 1.

 

When Elladan attacks an Orc how much bonus attack does he get?

> Keeping Count only targets a single other copy of Keeping Count when calculating the attack bonus. So, if there were 3 copies of Keeping Count in play, one on Glorfindel with 5 tokens, one on Elrohir with 3 tokens, and one on Elladan with 1 token, then Elladan could get at most a total of +4 attack strength from Keeping Count (4 being the difference between his 1 token and Glorfindel’s 5).

Who are all you people managing to get three copies of Keeping Count out in the first place?!

(Thank God for the Caleb ruling... Otherwise I had visions of Seastan figuring out some way of abusing the card by running 4 of the same mono-Tactics deck in conjunction... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )

I'm glad german translators seem to do a good Job... sometimes ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

The Problem definitely evolves around the english language =D

I use it in an Erestor/Arwen deck with Elven light. In my last two games I've ended up with all three in play pretty early.

My favorite method is Hama + Foe Hammer (+ optional Rohan Warhorse).  I've had a few games where I was able to get 2 kills per turn with Hama, then give someone a huge attack boost by turn 4-6.
