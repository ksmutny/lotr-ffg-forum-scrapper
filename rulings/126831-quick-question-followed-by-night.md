So, this card says:

"The first player (choose 1): deals 1 damage to all allies in play and Followed By Night gains surge, or all enemies engaged with players make an immediate attack, if able."

Can I choose the second even if there are no enemies engaged? If so, then great. But if not, then I'll lose. I thought that I couldn't choose it without being able to fulfill it, but just wanted to clarify.

I asked Caleb about this a while back to prove boooored wrong. Here's what he said:

When resolving any When Revealed effect that gives you a choice between two effects, you must choose an effect that you can fully resolve. Followed by Night is an odd example because you can always resolve either effect. That’s because it targets either ‘all allies’ or ‘all enemies’ and the word ‘all’ can include 0.

So you can pick the harmless option, you played it right. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
