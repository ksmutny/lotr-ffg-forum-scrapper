So, I keep hearing that we will be seeing the end of the adventure pack releases and that we are FFG will just release the larger expansion boxes from now on.  But it looks like there is at least one more AP cycle that hasn't really kicked off yet, Against the Shadow. 

Where are the rumors coming from about the adventure packs?

If you listen to the Cardboard of the Rings podcast, Caleb revealed to the team that the LotR:LCG line is one of the most profitable products. I can't see them messing a formula that is currently working. I think this game has a solid future ahead of it.
