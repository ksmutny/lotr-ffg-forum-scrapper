I have received clarification from Caleb as to which framework effects occur at the beginning and which do not occur at the beginning of their respective phases.

 

1.  Resource Phase: Each player adds 1 resource to each of his heroes’ resource pools, and draws 1 card.

2.  Travel Phase: Players may travel to 1 location if there is no currently active location.

3.  Encounter Phase: Each player may choose and engage 1 enemy from the staging area.

4.  Combat Phase: Deal 1 shadow card to each enemy.

5.  Refresh Phase:  Each player refreshes all cards he controls.  Each player raises his threat by 1.  First player token passes to the next player on the left.
