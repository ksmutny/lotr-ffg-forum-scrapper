Just like in the COTR progression series where they where wiped out in Road to Rivendell. Those who have seen it knows what I mean. They didn't just loose they where destroyed, grounded into dust and spread for the winds ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] does any other have any similar experiences?

My first attempt at the Lonely Mountain on solo, the first time I faced Smaug the Magnificent, he attacked me 6 times.  On the next turn, he attacked me 4 times and I was done.  As I kept flipping flipping over new shadow cards, watched him attack again and again, and ripped my dwarfs to pieces, I couldn't help but laugh.  I went from feeling like I had a good shot to beat the scenario to being totally crushed.  I went online to make sure I was playing it right, and Caleb's comment was something like: if Smaug toasted a dwarf army while taking Erebor, he can toast your dwarf army while defending it.  Well then.  When I finally beat the scenario, it made me feel really good!
