I'm testing out a dwarf mining deck at the moment, and making use of Dwarf Pipe to recycle discarded cards.

I understand how it works of you discard just one card. But how does it work if I discard multiple cards at a time (A Very Good Tale)? And what about if I have more than one pipe?

Say I have two Dwarf Pipes and play A Very Good Tale: can I return two of the discarded cards to the bottom of my deck? Any two of them? The last two? Do I have to decide whether to return a card before I discard the next card? Exactly when can I trigger the Pipe's response, when I am instructed to discard 5 cards in one go?

Thanks!

Caleb, in these rulings, implies you discard the AVGT cards one at a time, and Dwarf Pipe(s) must be fired immediately after a card you wish to save is discarded:
