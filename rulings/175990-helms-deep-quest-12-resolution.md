# [Helm&#039;s Deep Quest 1/2 Resolution](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175990-helms-deep-quest-12-resolution/)

1B states to advance to 2A at the end of the round

 

So, at the end of the round, 2A resolves

- Deeping Wall becomes active

- 1 to 4 copies of Soldier of Isengard are added to the staging area

- 1 to 4 cards are revealed

 

Then we advance to stage 2B

 

"Forced: at the end of the round place 1 progress here for each enemy in the staging area..."

 

So, before the end of the first round I need to place progress on 2B? That seems extreme and not the intent of the quest. 

 

What's the ruling on this? How are multiple "end of round" effects triggered? Has the end of the round passed by the time we get to stage 2B?

I'm pretty sure I saw an errata from a caleb answer... didn't bother adding it to my faq, but now I regret it...

Caleb:,,No. You should not trigger the end of round Forced effect on stage 2B unless you began the round at stage 2B."
