Silvan Tracker's ability reads:

 

"Response: After a Silvan character readies during the refresh phase, heal 1 damage from that character."

 

 

Question:

 

- Does a ready, damaged, silvan character heal during the refresh phase?

 

Of course, to have this question make sense I'm assuming that you can ready an exhausted card (but nothing happens ofc).

 

 

 

In the rulebook, you can read on page 22, refresh phase section:

 

"During the refresh phase, all exhausted cards ready"

 

But, on page 31 (quick reference), refresh pahse:

 

"• Each player refreshes all cards he controls."

 

 

Now, it seems clear that the quick reference should be viewed just as a shortcut, thus the actual rules are those comprised in the "rulebook" section, so I think if we want to follow the letter of the rulebook a (silvan) character that was ready doesn't heal any damage during refresh.

 

If all of the above is correct, however, I'm wondering what the intent was: was it phrased "refresh exhausted characters" just to make clear that ready characters do not need to refresh, so that it might be acceptable as some kind of house rule to have ready characters "ready" during refresh (thus healing 1 dmg), or do you think it would be against the spirit of the rules?

It seems a bit strange to me that you cannot get a benefit because you couldn't do something you usually want to avoid - also see Galadriel + Arwen : it's very strange that something that's supposed to work in you favor can actually hinder you.

I think having the option to exhaust characters as an action during combat phase would solve both these issues.

The rulebook in the section that summarize the step... summarize the steps.

So page 22 is better worded than page 31.

 

The trick is better demonstrated with Arwen, exhausting should not be "free" and available at demands, even if it seems a disavantage. If you need to heal, then the risk is to exhaust first. That is a basic risk/reward type bonus, even if weird.

Basic rules: do not interpret or use logic/thematic to find a "why" to how something is worded. It shoud be used as it is worded. When in doubt, though, ask Caleb.

 

I recommend using Spare Hood and Cloack if you want to get away from this limitation.

Thanks for your answer.

 

My question was twofold: whether my literal interpretation was correct and whether the literal interpretation was taken into account when creating the card, so that the card effect is exactly what it was supposed to be ("the spirit of the rules").

Even though I think we came to the same conclusion as far as the rules go, I don't think I agree on your risk-reward argument: all it takes is one enemy engaged with you to be able to exhaust all your characters during the combat phase, and I don't see no risk/reward in this - there is the risk of having to fight the enemy, but that has nothing to do with your choice of risking to heal or not - it's more a matter of whether you'll have to deal with that enemy or not.

Feels kinda weird, imo.

Also, I don't understand your argument for Arwen-Galadriel: what I'm saying is that it doesn't make sense from a thematic point of view, in this there's no rules-interpretation doubt. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

"Basic rules: do not interpret or use logic/thematic to find a "why" to how something is worded." From a rules-interpreting standpoint, I agree 100%. However, part of what makes me like this game so much is the fact that it's higly thematic, so I think finding ways to have rules make more sense from a thematic (and logical too) standpoint would enrich the game.
