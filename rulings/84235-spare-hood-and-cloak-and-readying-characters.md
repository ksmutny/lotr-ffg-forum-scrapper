Spare Hood and Cloak: "Action: Exhaust Spare Hood and Cloak and exhaust attached character to ready another character. Then, attach Spare Hood and Cloak to that character."

Can I exhaust Spare Hood and Cloak and the character, to whom it is attached, to "ready" another character, who is not exhausted?

Or more general: Can I use effects, which ready characters, on already ready characters? Or can only exhausted characters made ready?

I repeat: If you should be right, and only ready characters could be made ready, what is the reason then, that you find in the basic rules and on countless cards alike, the phrase "ready all exhausted characters" or "ready an exhausted character"? If only exhausted characters can ready by general rule, then the term "exhausted" would be superflous in all these phrases.

 

 

i really think theres a point where you could read too far into any rule into this game and while it is obviously wise to question the wording to find out the real way to play the game, some of the wording is there just becuase thats the way it is written.

there is nothing as far as i know that says you can ready a ready character…but then again there is nothing that says otherwise (however i also remember something similar to muemakan…though i cant find it) so does that mean you can't? well if you want to know for sure send a rules request to caleb…im sure thats the only way to know for sure, and im interested to know the outcome
