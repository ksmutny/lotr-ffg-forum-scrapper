Looks like they opted to redo the Netrunner Core Set rather than reboot the whole game. Could LotR be next?

I would love that, especially if it came with some new quests.

Thoughts?

The Netrunner re-core doesn't really do anything to the game except maybe help new people get into the game with less upfront expenditure by giving them more relevant cards in the core.  That could happen to us or not.  I wouldn't care one way or the other unless it brought more players in (which is good for our game).  We still see new threads of people joining our game all the time though.

If we were to get a V2 - and I don't think we need it yet, but maybe in a few more cycles - I hope that it's a complete reboot and we start from scratch.  (I have a lot of ideas, but I'll keep them to myself unless Caleb asks me.)
