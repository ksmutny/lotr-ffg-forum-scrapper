The wording is a bit confusing to me here--does this mean that if you have a silvan tracker in play, *all* silvan characters heal a wound when they ready?  Or is it just one per silvan tracker?  I was thinking the latter, but it seems kind of unclear.  (of course, they heal 2 wounds if Elrond is around, hehe).

I asked a rule question and here is the answer:

> You can trigger the Silvan Tracker's ability for each Silvan character that readies during the refresh phase. If 8 Silvan character's ready at the same time, you will trigger the Response 8 times and resolve them one by one.
