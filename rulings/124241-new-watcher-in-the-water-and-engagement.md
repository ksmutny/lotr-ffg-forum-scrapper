# [New Watcher in the Water and engagement](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124241-new-watcher-in-the-water-and-engagement/)

So I had some questions come up about the new Watcher in The Ring Goes South:

 

Since he is: "considered to be engaged with the first player"

 

Does he interact with the "when a player engages an enemy deal 1 damage to the active location" text on the quest card? When does he do this? Just the first time he enters play? Every time the first player token changes? At the beginning of each engagement phase?

 

The answer to that question would also answer the question of when do the Sam, Pippin, etc's abilities trigger.

 

Thanks in advance for your thoughts

Nice one...

I'd say each time the engagement status changes, and that would be when the watcher enters play, then every time the token changes.

I didn't notice since I played solo, so that was a moot point.

 

I asked a ruling about Sam some time ago about the effect "put [...] enemy into play engaged with the first player" (check here: http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/92528-sam-gamgee-and-the-prancing-pony/#entry895171 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/92528-sam-gamgee-and-the-prancing-pony/#entry895171])

 

> Any time an enemy ends up in your play area, engaged with you, it has engaged you and you have engaged it. It doesn't matter if it comes from the staging area, the encounter deck, discard pile, or even out of play: if it ends up in your play area, it has engaged you. And if that enemy's engagement cost is higher than your threat, Sam's ability will trigger at that time.

 

However, the answer was about "entering the play area", so this might not apply here.

Actually, the watcher never "enters the play area", he's only "considered engaged".

But the more I read this, the more I understand it as "both applies": he engages and he's also in the staging area (meaning that he could also be targeted by dunhere for example).

 

Think this requires a ruling question to Caleb...

Indeed, Caleb confirmed, same as Durin's Bane:

 

> In order for a player to engage an enemy (or an enemy to engage a player) it must enter your play area. An enemy in the staging area that is “considered engaged” with you has not actually engaged you because it has not been moved to your play area.
> 
> Therefore, The Watcher will not trigger Sam’s Response effect or the Forced effect on stage 4b because it does not actually engage you.
