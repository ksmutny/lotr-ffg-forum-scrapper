just like to say congrats to caleb and the team for making a really intriguing quest line (at least it looks it)

PS - ive been trying to edit this post for about 15 minutes now….**** forum being slow again…anyways what i was wanting add was given the storyline on the rules sheet and the title i think its clear the hero is denethor
