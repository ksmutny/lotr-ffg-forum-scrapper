So my wife and I were playing "Flies & Spiders" from On the Doorstop tonight. Her deck had some pretty decent card draw mechanics plus the Poison cards made her go through it extra fast. About halfway through the game she had run through her entire deck. What happens then in regards to taking Poison. Were her characters then immune to further Poison attachments as she had no more cards to put under them?Â

Just got an official response, even though we already came to this conclusion:

If you run out of cards in your deck when the Venom keyword triggers, then there are no cards to attach as Poison and nothing happens.
Cheers,
