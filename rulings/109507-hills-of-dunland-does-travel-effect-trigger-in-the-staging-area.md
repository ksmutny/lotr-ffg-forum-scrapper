Hills of Dunland, a new location from The Dunland Trap, reads:

 

While Hills of Dunland is in the staging area, it gains: "Forced: After a player draws any number of cards, discard the top card of the encounter deck. If the discarded card is a Dunland enemy, put it into play engaged with that player. This ability does not stack with other copies of Hills of Dunland."

 

Travel: Each player draws a card to travel here.

_______

 

The question arose while playing is does its Forced Effect trigger when you travel there? Is this location considered to still be in the staging area, or is it "in between" the staging area and the active location? The way we played it was that it was still in the staging area when you draw a card from its travel effect, so each player had to discard the top of the encounter deck. This seems to be what was intended.

 

What do you all think?

When a location has a Travel cost, the players must pay that cost before they can travel to that location. So, Hills of Dunland is in the staging area when you trigger its Travel effect, which means you will also trigger its Forced effect when you do.
Hope you’re enjoying The Dunland Trap!
