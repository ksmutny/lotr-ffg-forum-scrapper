I can't find this answer anywhere...

 

If Overcome by Grief is attached to your hero, and it was your char that was destroyed, does the forced affect trigger right away? Or only the next time one of your chars is destroyed?

Pretty sure that you do have to trigger the second effect. The cards forced effects must be triggered in order as the card reads I'm pretty sure, making the second effect trigger after the first. Could be wrong but pretty sure this is the case, maybe ask Caleb?

I actually found this (with respect to Responses only) in the rules but it DOES NOT APPLY to events so you can still play cards like A Test of Will.  It says:

 

> In order to trigger a response on a hero, ally, or attachment card, the card on which the response is printed must be in play, unless the response specifies that it can be triggered from an out of play state. Event cards with “Response:” effects are responses that are played from a player’s hand.

 

So it seems that Locations and Enemies should follow the same rules as heroes, allies, and attachments, but I see no reason why a treachery card with a Forced effect could not chain like Valiant Sacrifice and Foe-hammer.
