It's hard to say if these two are going to work together. Can response of Lord of Morthond trigger before Gandalf loses his printed leadershit icon?

We can speculate on it all day long, but I think I'll just email Caleb this question to make it easier for all of us.

> I think not.  Big problem with the wording.  Each hero must have a PRINTED leadership icon.  Gandalf has none.  That's my reading of it.

Please read the card again. It's says gandalf is considered to have the printed resource icon. Keyword: printed. It's written right on the **** card.

I agree biggest issue is resource icon fades once card is played and LOM says after card is played. We will await Caleb's gospel on this.

Hi Harry,
If you are using Gandalf and two leadership heroes, all three of your heroes would be considered to have the printed leadership icon when you play a card from the top of your deck. This would allow you to play cards like Strength of Arms from the top of your deck. However, Gandalf’s ability is only active while you are playing that card. As soon as that card is played he reverts to neutral status. Since Lord of Morthond’s response effect triggers “After you play…” Gandalf would already have lost the printed leadership icon by that time and you would not be able to use it to draw a card.
Cheers,
Caleb
