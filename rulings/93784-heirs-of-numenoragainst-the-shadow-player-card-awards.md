# [Heirs of Numenor/Against the Shadow Player Card Awards](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93784-heirs-of-numenoragainst-the-shadow-player-card-awards/)

On Cardgame DB, when A Game of Thrones LCG cycle ends, they vote on awards for cards in the cycle, and I thought that would be a fun thing to do with the player cards in this cycle.  Not everyone has played all the quests yet (including myself), but all the player card spoilers are out there so I thought we could vote on a few categories.  The cards that are eligible for voting are from the Heirs of Numenor deluxe expansion, Steward’s Fear, Druadan Forrest, Encounter at Amon Din, Assault on Osgiliath, Blood of Gondor, and Morgul Vale.  Heroes and player cards are eligible.  Depending on the interest level in the poll, I’ll keep it open until next Wednesday before I tally the results.  The award names are attempts to make jokes on the meta-game.  Enjoy :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] !

General Poll:

What sphere got the best cards? Leadership: Despite the grief we gives Outlands, all of the good outlands extras are in the leadership sphere. There's also Visionary Leadership and Boromir which solidify the Gondor Synergy

What sphere got the short stick? Neutral Well Equipped is yeah…, Good Harvest got nerfed when Caleb clarified that you had to have a sphere match. Palantir, while thematic, is hard to use. Hobbit Sense looks good but got blown away by the goodness of Black Riders.  Where’s our Vilya, our Gandalf 2.0, or the songs?

What was the best deck archetype to come out of this cycle? The Mono-Leadership Gondor deck.  It builds itself, buffs allies, and can make a ton of resources with the ability to give them away to other players very easily.

Did you like the focus on mono-sphere decks? Yes, it's easy to play pick-up games with multiple people - assign spheres and there is no risk of conflicts with unique heroes.

Awards:

 1.  The Chuck Norris Exhaust to Win Award (best player card) Gondorian Shield
 2.  The Fatty: When He Exhausts, Discard Him Award (worst  player card) Harbor Master. To make this guy useful, you need to have at least two card effects add resources to your heroes resource pools. How often can you make that happen in a game?
 3.  Angry Bear Swings Twice Award (most thematic player card) - The Records, probably the Book of Eldacar.  It's cool to think that a hero is rummaging through this old battlefield manual to learn the secrets of a Quick Strike, or how to call more Eagles into action (The Eagles are coming), etc
 4.  Haldir is a Boy Award (best player card art) - Trained for War.  There is so much story wrapped up in that card.  Boromir and Faramir practicing while Denethor watches form the Shadows.  Boromir, the outwardly stronger and brasher brother, is besting Faramir, etc.
 5.  Boromir Ringbearer Award (most overpowered player card) - Mithrandir's Advice, I love this card but it is disgusting how quickly a mono-lore deck can churn through a 50-card deck with this card
 6.  Bill the Pony Award (card that seems innocent, but is very powerful) Hidden Cache. At first it seems a little blah or useless, but I think already people are figuring out just what his can do for you.
 7.  Hail of Apples Award (cool but useless player card) Ithilien Pit. It's nice to have another trap, but this one seems to rarely pack the same punch as all the other traps
 8.  It’s a B+ (not the best player card, but you’ll use it a lot) White Tower Watchman. Maybe a little expensive and only really useful as a blocker, but his ability has saved many of my heroes
 9.  Gimli and Legolas Superfriends Award (best co-op player card) Visionary Leadership
 10. Tom Bombadil is the Witch King Award (most controversial player card) Hirluin the Fair.  Why does this second-tier leader tie the outlands troops together.  Why not Prince Imrahil? Why not Forlong?

Ok, I couldn't do the whole thing, I just support some views that I feel strong about.

 

Outlands again, I think the cry is now almost unanimous, and I think it is great for the community, it shows we don't want easy ways out, we want excitement. And I feel Caleb & Co. want the same, so please, these were a mistake - every one does them but it is nice to do something about them when it happens. That said, the Herdsman and Men of the West together with Lord of Morthond are the cards that make them almost invincibly bad.

 

Palantír is really a great thematic card.

 

Denethor is controversial. Very poor in comparison to Faramir (ally). If there's no direct damage to heroes (aka Necromancer's Reach or Blocking Wargs) then he is still good. But a card like Denethor should be wicked, have something special in it - and not just negative.

 

So many cards with great art. I have to go with Boromir but it is mostly the locations I like the most.

 

Emery is the one card people had initially thought it wasn't good enough, but I feel it is just the opposite: among the strongest in the whole cycle.

 

Gondorian Shield and Visionary Leadership are best Gondor representations here, I feel.

 

My thanks also go for the mono-sphere idea, I like it very much. Whilst Against the Shadow and Advance Warning events may not be as strong as the Leadership and Tactics equivalents, Spirit got Pelargir Shipwright who is a winner in a mono-Spirit (not to mention Emery again) whilst Lore got Mithrandir's Advice. The recycling attachments are also great.

Sorry for interrupting the thread, but I read 2 times that A Good Harvest can only be used when you have a resource match. I just wanted to make sure that it is of course still possible to pay for cards of any sphere with AGH, but not if they have a cost of zero.

I agree with most of what you're saying. Denethor is a great card for certain decks (Hobbits, Frodo, Beregond). Emery is a great ally, Gondorian Shield is superb, and Palantir is very thematic, although I don't use it very often.

4. Haldir is a Boy Award (best player card art): Advance Warning

5. Boromir Ringbearer Award (most overpowered player card): Gondorian Fire
