# [Surge as Shadow effect](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/269759-surge-as-shadow-effect/)

What do I do with a shadow effect that may get Surge? Case in point is:-

Call of the Curse (Temple of the Deceived, Nightmare card 8) has a Shadow effect: "Resolve the 'when revealled' effect of Call of the Curse." The When Revealed text says: "until the end of the round, each Undead enemy gets +X [att] and +X [def]. X is the number of locations ... If X is 0 or 1, Call of the Curse gains surge."

In my game, X is 0. Do I ignore the surge, deal another shadow card as the "surge" effect, or reveal another card?

(I seem to remember reading a similar ruling/topic before, but now can't find it - so apologies if I am going over old ground).

Surge is part of the when revealed effect who says "reveal an additional card". Does it solve the problem? Not really since we are not revealing cards so revealing an additional card don't necessary take sense.

We agree about the fact that the spirit is to reveal a card anyway. So even if the rules as we know them don't reveal a card I'm pretty sure that Caleb would rule to reveal one.
