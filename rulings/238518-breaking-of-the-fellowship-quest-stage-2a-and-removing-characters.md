In the quest "Breaking of the Fellowship", stage 2A says:

 

"When Revealed: Remove the Ring-bearer, and each card attached to it, from the game (treat The One Ring's text as blank while resolving this effect)."

 

Later in the game, you must obtain the objective card "Frodo's Choice", which says:

 

"When Revealed: Take control of the first player token and the Ring-bearer (and each card attached to it)."

 

My questions are:

- What happens with damage and resource tokens on the Ring-bearer when he leaves/re-enters play?

- What happens if the Ring-bearer was ready/exhausted when he is removed? when he re-enters game-play, does he re-join in that same condition, or exhausted no-matter-what, or ready no-matter-what?

Here is Caleb's answer for a question I've asked once (with my emphasis on Frodo's part):
 

> Q: Black Riders: When I travel to Weather Hills I can place an enemy card facedown under that location. What about attachments like Pale Blade that are attached to Nazgul enemy then? Are they also placed facedown and return to play when that enemy returns to staging area, or are simply discarded? Also, if that enemy would have any damage tokens, what about them? Do they stay or are discarded? The same - regarding damage - with Frodo in 1st scenario of the Road Darkens, when he is captured by the Watcher.
> A: When you place an enemy facedown under the Weather Hills, that enemy leaves play. Any cards attached to it, or tokens on it, are discarded at that time. The rules for Frodo and the Watcher are different because it specifically says that each card attached to him stays attached. However, damage is discarded when he is turned facedown.

I'd say that, as damage is discarded, so are resources then.

I'd also say that when he comes back to the in-play state, he comes ready, no matter what was his state before.
