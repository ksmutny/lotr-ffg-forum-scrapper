I couldn't find the answer to this anywhere.  Maybe it's obvious but I have been wrong before.  😏  If I declare Beregond as a defender against a 1 health attacker and he destroys the enemy with a spear of the citadel before shadows effects are resolved / attack vs defense is calculated is he still considered to have defended against an attack and taken no damage to trigger his ability?

@NathanH [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/254124-nathanh/] nailed it this time (for the record, I was privately leaning in the wrong direction, heh):

The FAQ states: "When resolving an enemy attack, the defending player should check the status of the attacking enemy at end of each step: is there still an attacking enemy? ... If no, end the attack." What does this mean for card effects that trigger "after [a character] defends"? e.g., Spirit Beregond has a Spear of the Citadel, and he is declared as a defender against an enemy attack. The Spear kills the enemy. Can Beregond lower my threat by 1? Similarly for any hero that has a Spear and Armored Destrier attached.
