The Goblin Archer of 48 threat from the Rivendell quests has a "forced" effect that deals 1 damage to a character for each enemy revealed, but does it count for the archer itself too? I'd assume not, but FFG has other games where cards do trigger for themselves (like Game of Thrones responses), so I'm asking just in case. Thanks.

Someone email Caleb.

 

Edit: I emailed in the question.  Will post results when I get them.

Official response from Caleb:

I was hoping for a more expanded response that explains why it triggers, but at least we have an answer.
