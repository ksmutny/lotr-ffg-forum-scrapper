That was also at a time the game didn't really know what it was doing (not to anyone's real fault). Ever since Caleb and Matt "took office" we've seen a much wider variety of heroes in cycles, and which they have explicitly said they strive for.

Tl;dr: It's much more likely they will do things more like the past 2 cycles than Dwarrowdelf.

Just curious, do you know the exact point where Caleb and Matt took office?   I'm curious how far the game was developed before they took over.

Caleb started working in the LCG with the Hobbit boxes, and then he joined the developer team during Against the Shadow and finally became lead developer in the Ring-Maker cycle.

I already asked Caleb about Deorwine:



> I believe Deorwine’s ‘Action’ should be a ‘Response’ to allow his ability to work as intended. His effect is meant to cancel the shadow effect after it is revealed and before it resolves in a similar fashion to Hasty Stroke.
