Hi folks,

 

perhaps you can help me with some rulings about Schwert-Than (Sword-thain) [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=7547]

 

in another thread Caleb was quoted that an ally which is put into play by Sneak attack and then switched to be a hero by Sword-thain must not get back into your hand because the ally played by Sneak attack is no longer in play.

 

As a result of this quote .. the ally leaves play somehow, right?

so, what about using responses which triggers if a character or ally leaves play?

can i use such responses if Sword-Thain is used?

 

e.g.

Heldenhaftes Opfer (Valiant Sacrifice) [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=24]

Horn von Gondor (Horn of Gondor) [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=42]

Éomer (Éomer) [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=4215]

Caleb writes me an answer to my question by mail.

To trigger "leave play"-moments a card must physically moved out of play .. same for come into play. So no, Sword-thain does not trigger such reaktions for a leaving ally.
