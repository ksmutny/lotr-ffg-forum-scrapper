"When Revealed:  Starting with the last player, each player must either return a Nazgûl  enemy engaged with him to the staging area or make a Hide 2 test."

 

Can we just choose to return a Nazgûl enemy, even if not engaged with one, and just ignore the ones in the staging area?

Or is it implied that we must make a Hide 2 test if not already engaged with a Nazgûl?

 

If the latter is the case I really wish they would have worded it like "each player must return a Nazgûl enemy to the staging area. If not engaged with a Nazgûl the player must instead make a Hide 2 test"

Got an answer from Caleb:

You cannot choose an option that you cannot fulfill. If you are not engaged with a Nazgul, then you must make a Hide test.
Hope you're enjoying The Black Riders!
