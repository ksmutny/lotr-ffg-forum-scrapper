Hi, just received my copy of Roam across Rhovanion. For building the encounter deck , there is a mismatch between the information sheet and the quest cards.  The info sheet says to build the encounter deck with Fell Beasts, Lost in Wilderland and Hills of Wilderland, the quest cards all show the symbols for Fell Beasts, Gathering Gloom and Hills of Wilderland. I am assuming the sheet is correct - but does anyone know for sure?

This came up at Con of the Rings, and Caleb said that the rules insert was correct (so Lost in the Wilderness).

While Calebs decision is what you should go with, does that not break the golden rule, that the cards overrule the rulebook?

Unless of course the card is just plain wrong, that's what errata is for.
