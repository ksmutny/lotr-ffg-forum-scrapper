Well, it is that time. Usually within a week from the "shipping" state someone starts posting the spoilers. Now, I am eager to see the rest of the Grey Havens (as there still may be quite a few). I wonder that after all these years, I still feel the anticipation. Do you?

And please, someone, if you have it, share it!

From this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197836-record-attachment-and-heavy-curse/], Caleb said "To play an event, you must first pay its cost. Tome of Atanatar allows you to play an event in your discard pile “as if it were in your hand” but it is not actually in your hand. It is still in the discard pile at the time you must pay its cost, so Heavy Curse would increase its cost."  So I'm inclined to think it's still in the discard pile.  Unless he's saying that it's only in the discard pile while you are paying the cost, at which point it is no longer in the discard.  Very confusing.

Good. It's nice to have a tip in favor of players from time to time.

 

Also, Eomer grappling hooking the quest for 5 anyone? (or even for 7 with Firefoot)

Having just been playing a lot of Rohan, Eomer/Firefoot was the first thing that came to mind as well.

I sent in a request to Caleb for clarification about the is-it-in-the-discard issue, specifically for these new Grey Havens events, so we'll hear one way or another soon.

 

What's doubly nice about Grappling Hook is that you can decide to do it after staging but before quest resolution.
