On episode 123 of CotR, Chad and Chris (me) interview the lead designer of LotR: The Card Game, Caleb Grace. We dive deep into the inner workings of the game with the help of other employees of Fantasy Flight Games, including past designers Nate French and Matt Newman. 

Also in this episode:

 * Caleb gives some advice for those of you attending a Fellowship Event.
 * We discuss the evolution of a couple of player-favorite cards.
 * Chad and Chris reveal the new Patreon page.
 * And much much more.

Thanks for listening!

It's being reported on BGG that Caleb said on this show that there was going to be a "big announcement" this week.

That report is indeed correct. He also confirmed that for the last year he worked on LOTR stuff which haven't been released yet.

Unfortunately, we've received word that this announcement has been delayed until early December.
