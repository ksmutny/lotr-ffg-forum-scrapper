This post is an idea tha sure all the fans of LOTR-LCG had got in mind in any moment. A window where you can post (display, show...) your own ideas about any card you have thought up.

It could have got a very good ideas, of course. Came on! (and Caleb, Matthew and company maybe, seeing these ideas, could be prompted :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif] ).

You can post only with the words, or even with an entire 'fanmade' card (click here [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/8458408#8458408]to get the temps of Gecko).

I start with my first ideas, lets go!

********* HOW TO POST IMAGE CARD FILES **********

 

1. Downloading the templates (click here [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/8458408#8458408]to get the temps of Gecko).

2. Working the templates with Photoshop

     - insert the image -there are webs with lots of image arts like deviantart, tumbler, .... searching in google-;

     - add the text you have thought...

     - and -important i think- reduce the size of the template to 500px minimum

3. Upload the image to a server (for example, imageshak)

4. Include the image in your post, by the key 'Image' (insert in the url text the image link that you got in the server in point 3).

Nice ideas for a start!  Here's how I'd work the pipe:

 

2 cost Unique

attach to an Istari character.

exhaust pipe and attached character to reduce your threat by 1.

 

 

make the wand unique, and I think it could maybe stand as it is.

Caleb of Pelargir: are you crazy?!!! :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]  The most overpowered character i haven't never seen!!! He is a superfusion-elrohir/elladan. (The art is amazing, however)

Pelargir Tough: very very good, yeah. Nice idea, sure. (The art is from one quest card of Pelargir quest :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif] ) Mmmh, another version of the tactic outlander.

Prolongued exploration: nice idea, but maybe overpowered? mmmmmh, maybe not. Ok, good...nice. Congratulations for your brilliant ideas. (The art is used by one fanmade card, but it is valid repeat if it is so... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] )

Things Long Forgotten: nice the relationship of bottom card with the 'forgotten' idea. But... do you know Mithrandil Advice? Maybe too powered combo. (I dont like nothing the art :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png]  lol :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ). Maybe change the sphere and use leadership with an Aragorn drawing (he learning his past).

 

But very funny your post. I think this thread is the most funny of all the forum at the moment.

Can you shed some thoughts on why you think Caleb of Pelargir is overpowered? He costs a hefty 4 to play, has medicore stats block, is unique and his ability is limited to once per turn by player and is a major resource sink.

Thematically I tried to portray a veteran sellsword, different players paying him to get his service from time to time.

 

You can't imagine how hard was to come by any fitting thug art around the internet. I'm happy that I have found this one, a familliar face.

 

Prolonged exploration takes your progress from quest, costs 2 and does not guarantees everybody a free card. It's also restricted to the travel phase.

 

I can't see how Mithradil Advice and Things Long Forgotten is a combo. Both are card draws but from different sources. And TLF requires quite a setup to draw more. I can see how TLF can be comboed with those event-returning attachments introduced in the Against the Shadow cycle.

Caleb of Pelargir is like the dunedain attachments, but as an ally, so more independent. Once he has been played, he is very powerfull. He is like X (number of players) rohan horses but in the moment you want.

 

Lol, i know how hard is searching for images. I have made some fanmades, one of them with 32 diferent cards. I know, believe me.

 

Ok, Prolonged Explorations is not overpowered, for a moment i forgot the condition of getting progress tokens on the quest card and placing on the active location. Very original idea. Nice.

 

Agh, sorry: my mistake, i was wrong: i wanted to say Scroll of Isildur. (I was wrong because i usually use Mithrandil Advice with Scroll of Isildur). The combo would be: you use MAdvice (in a monolore), you return by SIsildur, and you return to get MAdvice by TLF. And if you have other SI... uf! Half deck is drawn.

Fortunately for us, those cards will never see the light of day :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Speaking of which, I made a few more Pelargir inhabitants:

And here goes new Caleb. Still as tough and resourcful.

I love all of these, though....

- Caleb can be pretty dang powerful. He can be essentially an additional 2 willpower per player. One player commits him, then the next player "buys" him and commits him, then the next player... I wouldn't say overpowered, since there is still a decent cost to do this, but certainly still a powerful card.

- I might say to remove the "Draw 1 additional card..." bit from Things Long Forgotten, but most of the time, you won't be playing more than 2 copies of it per game, so it's not overly powerful.

 

Many of your cards seem to be right on the brink of being potentially too powerful, but never really crossing that line. Good job.

Thanks!  I've done some custom card designs, but I don't have time or tools to do it at the moment.  I think this thug-related string of posts inspired me to throw out some new ideas.

 

BTW, my thinking on the contractor was that if Outlands can have a spend X to retrieve X, a card swap once per turn shouldn't be too bad.  You'd have to have reliable card draw to make it worthwhile, and you'd still spend the cost to play the card. Hama has a similar effect and arguably tactics events are more potent individually.  None of the proposed thug cards are gamebreaking really (minus the first iteration of Caleb!).

## 9 [MyNeighbourTrololo on February 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=997560)

I'll probably give most of the Thugs spheres, add some more thugs to make their count even among the spheres, will give it a big good dam thought to balance them out, add some events and attachments too. And a Spirit Thug hero ofcourse. And then I'll make an OCTGN set with all of this to test it out in actual gameplay.

 

Here's what I think...

 

Allies:

Spirit: Silent Watcher, Whisper;

Lore: The Owl, 1 more non-unique thug;

Tactics: 1 unique and 1 non-unqiue thug;

Leadership: Harbor Mercenary, 1 more unique thug;

Neutral: Pelargir Tough, Caleb of Pelargir.

 

Events:

Spirit: Laying Low;

Lore: will be added;

Tactis: Dirty Trick;

Leadership: Cunning Scheme;

Neutral: Ambush!

 

...hm, Dirty Trick looks a bit unspectacular compaed to all other spheres. I'll probably move him to Neutral(so thre'll be 2 neutral events) and add something more vague to the tactics there.

I think, one thug-related event is enough for each sphere(except for neutral, as I can see now). Making attachments for each sphere will be hard.

Sure! I thought the same just when i exit from photoshop (and i dont save the original psd file).

 

 

And here is our spirit dunedain hero (this time Caleb sure copies me ^^ -would be a pleasure-):

I would have worded it differently but it is certainly interesting. I also don't think I am as in love with the idea as much as you since that situation doesn't generally become all that big of an issue usually. If an active location prevents me from getting to the quest card too much, then I would rather clear the location anyway. I can definitively think of some times when it would have been great but still seems rather situational to me.
