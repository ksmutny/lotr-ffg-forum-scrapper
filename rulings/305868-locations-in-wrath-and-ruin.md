How does the victory display interact with locations and the quest cards in Wrath and Ruin? If I have a location (let's say Seedy Tavern) which when explored should go to the victory display does it do so or do we take control of it instead?

Right now I can see this going both ways but it can be quite important for fulfilling the quest conditions.
