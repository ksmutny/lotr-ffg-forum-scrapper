What happens if you discard the outrider to engage Chief Turch ? Does he engage you, or does he stay engaged with the first player ?

Â 

The text on his card reads "engages the first player", but when ? Is this a continual passive ability (he is always engaged with the first player) or a one time effect at the passing of the first player token ?

I asked the question to Caleb.
