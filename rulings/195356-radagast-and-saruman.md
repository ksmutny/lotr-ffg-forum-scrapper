We really need some good versions of these cards.  It kills me that Radagast sucks so much.  I'd love to see a Radagast or Saruman hero (or both).  I don't understand for the life of me why we have a Grima hero and no Saruman hero.  What would everyone's hero version of these two Istari be?  

 

Mine:

 

Saruman: Neutral

Threat 15

 

W: 3

A: 5

D: 2

HP: 5

 

Once per round, exhaust Saruman to take control of a non-unique enemy in the staging area.  That enemy leaves the staging area and enters your play area.  The enemy has 0 willpower.   Return it to the staging area at the end of the refresh phase.  If Saruman readies, return the enemy to the staging area immediately.  

 

Radagast: Threat: 12

Lore

 

W: 2

A: 2

D: 3

HP: 5

 

Radagast's resources may be used to pay for creature allies from any sphere.  You may spend one resource from Radagast's  pool to heal 1 damage from any creature in play.  Once per round you may exhaust Radagast to look at the top 5 cards of your deck and add one creature card revealed to your hand.  Shuffle your encounter deck afterwards.  

 

Of course there'd have to be versions of each of their staffs as well,  hopefully no rabbit sled for Radagast though.

At this point I don't even care half as much as I did before what our possible Saruman and Radagast heroes would do... I just want Caleb to get on with it and make them. After pretty much 2 cycles mostly comprising some very tertiary characters or FFG created characters, it's long due for us to get some powerful Istari for a change...

I couldn't agree more. I left the game at the beginning of the harad cycle but I'm looking to get back in now that its over. I'm still blown away there's no Saruman or radagast. I play this game specifically for the Tolkien stuff. Some ffg characters are fine but id like the stars to be characters I love from the stories. I'd also love to see a powerful lore galadriel hero. 

Sauron was afraid to attack Lorien pretty much just because of her after all.

I just want Caleb to get on with it and make them, honestly. With the very slow pace of releases and previews the game has lost A LOT of momentum for me, and I don't think I'm the only one. At this point I just want the game to get more Wizard heroes seeing everything else is being covered.

Maybe they're saving the big guns for last, like last ap elrond style or for next deluxe.

I think you're right (I hope you're right, assuming we're ever getting R&S heroes), especially considering what Caleb said in an article about saving up and spacing out important characters to keep player's attention. The difference with Elrond was that he was released in the second cycle of the game. The problem with saving the big guns for last, particularly when the game has slowed down to a pace that's less than half of what it used to be, is that players eventualy get tired of waiting.

I mean, sure, we might get them in the very last release of the game. But is it really worth it when during the game's life itself, when you actually got to play and test new quests and see the game evolve, you never got to play with them?

At this point Saruman must be the character with the most custom hero versions in the game. I just wish Caleb would get on with it and print him! Please! People, including myself, have been clamoring for him for over 5 years now!
