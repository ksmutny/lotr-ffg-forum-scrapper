I know we've got another cycle already announced, and the second Hobbit box too, so I'm not suggesting that the game is drying up or anything like that… but like lots of people I have noticed that the amount of news and previews is drying up.

August actually had the lowest number of news items since before the game was launched (with just 3 items). And then September came along and beat the record -- because that month only had 2 items.

Even the French site is getting more news than us, because apparently they've had some stuff about the new cycle ages ago, which we haven't got on ours yet.

I really miss the news, because it gives the people on this forum (and BGG too) something to talk about. We can't speculate on much anymore, other than the few cards that we've known about for ages.

I think FFG are missing a trick by drying up the news, especially when there's some new boxes in the pipeline, because it keeps the interest up. maybe they spoiled us in the past, and this is the normal amount that we should expect. Maybe we should compare how much news we get with what the other games go. I'm pretty sure that older games like Call of Cthulu and Game of Thrones get loads more

 

[PS… last time i asked about the news they posted a load more straight away about the new cycle, so im hoping that im going to jinx them into doing that again!]

I've been to Edge's site and haven't seen any of the previews the choppic, et al. have been posting, give me a link somebody, or at least what website they are talking about.

I'm not too worried about it (and I am playing catch-up with the cycles, so I'm happy for them to take their time). rich is right when he said that many of the spoiled mechanics have gotten little talk. I think we're averaging (unscientifically) 5-15 replies per spoiled keyword. Archery got very little talk. Battlegrounds and Siege also were largely ignored. In my recent update of the (SPOILERS) thread I've added all of the text to the known cards, with some inferred phrases as well. One surprise for me in that exercise was seeing all of the new keywords and card interactions. For example. If you explore The Citadel, an 11 point Battleground location soon enough, you remove a stage 4 from the quest deck. That's so cool and yet I haven't read anyone commenting on it. Then there's the whole Battleground mechanic where enemies damage locations and if the locations are destroyed you can't explore them or claim the victory points. I also saw on stage 2B of Siege of Cair Andros that there might be a new "sieging" stage in each round (for certain quests). Now that was very small print in an out of focus, digital photograph, but if that is actually the case, the designers have added a whole new stage to each round. That's HUGE (IMHO).

So my point is a lot is going on already, and we are basically ignoring it. I'm certainly to blame as my schedule has picked up so I'm posting less, and maybe we all just want more big and clear pictures of spoiled cards and mini-commentaries from Caleb. I imagine as October drags on we'll get some previews of The Hobbit II and HoN. Apparently Christian Petersen said the one will be out 1 month and a half or so after the other, so if they both hit this year, one must be out by mid-November at the latest (barring shipping problems).

On a semi-related topic, I think Heirs of Numenor must include some additional tokens (or maybe stickers a la choppic) since we need to keep track of damage on locations now, and so many quest stages/locations are over 10 points.
