COTR just uploaded some pics of the new Gen Con quest, The Ruins of Belegost, and an exclusive promo alt art Gimli!

While I personally know little of Belegost itself, other than it was a dwarven city in the Blue Mountains, I'm excited to see what appears to be a dragon or big drake boss to fight! Maybe an omen that we're going to the Withered Heath next deluxe/cycle?

> Does anybody know if the Gimli alternate art card will be part of the POD quest when released for regular purchase later this year or whether it is just included in the GenCon release?

According to the guys from COTR, who probably asked Caleb about this, he will be included, so I think it's fairly certain to think he'll be in the POD edition.

If you look at the COTR post now, you will find that they edited it to something along the lines of "we do not know", so I guess it is unlikely that they have actually asked Caleb (unfortunately).
