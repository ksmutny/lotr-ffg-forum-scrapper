# [Morgul Vale - Captain Murzag &quot;forced&quot; effect question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94687-morgul-vale-captain-murzag-forced-effect-question/)

Captain enemy, Murzag, in the Morgul Vale has the forced effect: "After Murzag attacks, reveal the top card of the encounter deck. If that card is an enemy, put it into play engaged with the defending player."

 

My question is, since it specifically says "reveal the top card" does that mean

 

(1) if it is a location it goes to the staging area and if it is a treachery you follow it's when revealed effects and doomed effects as normal?

Or (2) do you simply "reveal the top card" in the sense of the Ravens of the Mountain player card which intended to say "look at the top card" instead of "reveal"?

 

Or, (3) which is how I have played it before, you simply discard the card and don't resolve it's effects unless it is an enemy?

 

My hunch is that the first way is the correct one, even though that seems really powerful to reveal another card and add more threat to the staging if it's a location or trigger a nasty treachery card.

 

How have some of you been dealing with Murzag???

> Any time a location is revealed, you would resolve any "when revealed" effects and then add it to the staging area, right?  Per core set manual rules.  I didn't think we'd need a specific instruction on the card to do so.

I think Glaurung took Caleb as hostage and made it all by himself. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I checked the core set rules and I found nothing there that implicates that a card gets added to the staging area when it is revealed from the encounter phase outside of the staging step. IIRC all of the cards that are added to staging area outside of the staging step have a specific instruction to do so ("... and add it to the staging area"). In this quest we have Might of Mordor, quest card 3B The Morgul Rider and Impenetrable Fog which all have that addition.

 

I'm going to ask Caleb about this.

Interesting discussion on this. I agree with the fact that whenever they have told us to add cards to the staging area outside the quest phase then they usually say so (even if it might be redundant). However, key words like "reveal" usually mean the when revealed effects should trigger, that's why they had to errata Ravens of the Mountain to say "look at."

 

I think Glaurung may be right and they did mess this one up like with Ravens of the Mountain after all, it seems. I hope not, and rather we are missing something, since it is just silly for the designers at this stage in the game (given they have established certain phrases and key words by now) to miss something as critical as their wording on the Captain card. I understand mistakes happen, and unforeseen broken combos may arise, but this kind of mistake (if indeed it is) is not right.

 

Leptokurt, please report back with what you find out from Caleb, as this really does alter the difficulty of the quest significantly, especially for solo players as someone mentioned.

First I think yes is a new terms revealed without add to thr staging area so it means resolve whem revealed and discard a card. But then I remembered history of the game I say my self: probably as usual they just miss up again. Sorry it was couple of times begote why I not should be a sceptic a bit???

I like Caleb, Leptokurt he is best from all of them.

please we need a official answer. Hope im wrong.

I got an answer from Caleb. Not sure if you like it:

 

> Hi Jörg,
> Since "reveal and add to the staging area" is just long-hand for "reveal" we've mostly stopped using "and add to the staging area" in order to save space and allow room for more effects or flavor text. Therefore, Murzag's Forced effect works the same as any other effect that forces players to reveal cards from the encounter deck: resolve any "when revealed" effects and keywords, then resolve the staging of that card. If it is a treachery card, it is discarded after resolving its effects. If it is a location, add it to the staging area. If it is an enemy, Murzag's ability instructs the defending player to put it into play engaged with him instead of adding it to the staging area. That enemy will make an attack since it is still the "resolve enemy attacks" part of the combat phase, but it will not be dealt a shadow card.
> Hope you're enjoying the conclusion of the Against the Shadow cycle!

Thanks for sharing Caleb's ruling. I am actually glad that they intended it to work the way they worded it on the card more or less. It beats having to errata it. Extra difficulty is always good for the last quest of the cycle as well. Bring it on, Murzag!

I love this Caleb rule explanation. So revealed is just short of revealed and add....

And more difficult is always cool. Last 3 quests of the cycle is really good!
