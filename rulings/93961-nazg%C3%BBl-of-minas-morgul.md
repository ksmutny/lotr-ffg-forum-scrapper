Contains Morgul Vale Spoilers ...



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



After two harrowing attempts at beating Morgul Vale (and two near end-game defeats,) I had a quick question about the third captain, the Nazgûl of Minas Morgul.

 

Below the text that reads there can be not attachments to him, it reads: "Reduce any amount of damage dealt to Nazgûl of Minas Morgul to 1."  So, I was wondering if this meant he could only receive one damage per round or just one damage from altogether different combat actions each round.

 

For example, if I used Gandalf's arriving ability to deal four damage (which equates to one damage to the Nazgûl) at the beginning of the round during the planning phase... Then later in combat phase, I used a hero to deal another amount of damage to him (again brought down to one damage).  Both these events deal one damage to the Nazgûl but on separate occasions throughout one round.  

 

Ideas or thoughts on this?

This was a question with the Khazad-dum expansion and its Patrol Leader, as well.  I had never seen an official response... so I just got one!

 

Official response:

 

"Any time you would place damage on an enemy, that damage is "dealt" to that enemy. So even if you "move" damage to the Nazgul of Minas Morgul using Infighting, that damage is still "dealt" for the purposes of resolving the Nazgul's ability (which reduces it to 1). Furthermore, if a Morgul Bodyguard is in play, damage that would be moved to a Captain enemy would have to be placed on a Bodyguard instead.

Hope you're enjoying the scenario!

Cheers,

Caleb"

 

So there you have it.  Infighting won't help you more than any other card.

Hey GrandSpleen, how do you ask and receive answers directly from Caleb?

Quite a good point.

Makes me more curious as to what Caleb would have to say on this.
