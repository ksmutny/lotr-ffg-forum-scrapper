So, my group is a little uncertain regarding the timing of "after questing successfully."

Namely, do you trigger "After Questing Successfully" responses (Hirgon, Expert Treasure Hunter, etc.) before or after you place progress from questing successfully.


Let's say I'm on Stage 2B of a quest that has Long Defeat attached
There is an Ancient Mathoms attached to the active location, which has a Forced: When Explored effect that requires the player to discard cards at random from their hand
I quest with Hirgon, who has Expert Treasure Hunter attached
I quest successfully with enough progress to defeat Stage 2B and move to 3B


What is the exact order of how these things all transpire?

Do I have to resolve "After Questing Successfully" responses before any progress from questing is placed?  That is:
(1) Trigger Hirgon's Response and/or Expert Treasure Hunter Response in any order (if desired)
(2) Place Progress onto Active Location, exploring it and then...
   2a) resolving the Forced When Explored Effect
   2b) resolving the Ancient Mathoms response (if desired)
      ??? I assume the Forced of a location trumps the response of player card triggering off of exploration?
(3) Place Progress onto Quest 2B
  .... ????
... then to do you...
 defeat 2B and resolve Long Defeat first, or go to Quest 3A and resolve all of its instructions prior to resolving Long Defeat?




Or, do you place progress tokens first, clearing the active location, flipping the Quest stages, and then triggering any desired "After Questing Successfully" effects?



Basically, when progress placement is involved we're less confident in timing windows, especially when it results in going to a new Quest Stage with its own complicated set of instructions.

I think it's been ruled that 10 goes between 3 and 4 because even though things happen simultaneously Caleb said it leads to less intuitive results. 

Likewise, I would assume ancient mathom would trigger at that point too.

It would make sense that the long defeat would trigger upon clearing the quest and before revealing the next one.
