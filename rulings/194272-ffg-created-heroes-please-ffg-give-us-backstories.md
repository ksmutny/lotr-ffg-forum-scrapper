Dear FFG, Matt, Caleb,

 

I think lots of us really appreciate that you gave some backstory to the FFG-created hero lately: Idraen, Rossiel or Amarthiúl for instance. Especially, I found the backstory of Rossiel to be really compelling, making her a character I want to play although I was a bit skeptical about the whole theme/mechanics of victory display manipulation in the first place. Now I'd like to play elven magic.

 

I would be really really cool if you could give us the backstories of the other FFG-created heroes, namely Thalin, Eleanor, Beravor, Mirlonde and Caldara. I know some of them where already part of Middle-Earth quest RPG (the first three of them), so maybe part of my request can already be found somewhere. Anyway, I think it'd be a great addition to the "support" section online. I realise there's some work involved here, but I'm asking nonetheless.

 

PS: Oh and even the few unique allies you created along the way: Emery, Brok Ironfist, Henemarth Riversong and the next Eldahir, could we know just in a few lines who those fine free-people are?

 

Thanks for the amazing game  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
