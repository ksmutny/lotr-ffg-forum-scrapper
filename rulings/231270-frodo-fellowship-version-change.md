I'm playing quests in the Land of Shadow saga exp. Can I play with any version of Fellowship Frodo from past saga exps, or do I have to use the version that came in this box? The rules on page 4 seem a bit vague, without saying one way or the other... or I'm being dense. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I sent an email to Caleb to see if it's a misprint or not.

Caleb gave very quick response! He wrote this...

It is not a misprint: each of the scenarios in The Treason of Saruman and The Flame of the West is balanced against the Fellowship Aragorn included in the respective box. You cannot swap them.
