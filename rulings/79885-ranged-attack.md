The rivendell bow gives a character a +1 attack on "Ranged Attacks". What defines a ranged attack? is it an attack made by a character with the ranged ability? Is it only attacks that actually use the ranged ability, as in, attacking an enemy engaged with another player? If so, does hand upon the bow (allows you to attack the staging area with a ranged combatant) not count as a ranged attack?
 

Basically, im just trying to figure out when the +1 actually applied. Thanks

ranged attacks are only those where the characters does the attack against an enemy engaged with another player

legolas attacking with Hands upon.. is not a ranged attack, nor does he get the +1 with the bow

this isn't necessarily true - the great yew bow explicitly states that you are making a ranged attack into the staging area (and thus, not a ranged attack to help another player). so, using the GYB, you could get the benefit from the rivendell bow, as well, as it is still a ranged attack.



yes, i think you are right there….ok….up until now my answer was true, i was going on cards such as hands upon the bow, and didnt realise it specifically said ranged

as for captain poes 2nd question i can say with certainty that ricedwlit is correct as i had that one clarified by caleb

Got an official ruling on HUTB and attack type:

Rule Question:

Is the attack provided by "Hands upon the bow" considered a "normal attack" or a "ranged attack" ?

In other words: does HUTB played on Legolas with a Rivendell Bow attached result in a +2 ranged attack against an enemy in the staging area ?

 

"As the card is currently worded, Hands Upon the Bow grants a normal attack and not a ranged attack.

Cheers, Caleb"
