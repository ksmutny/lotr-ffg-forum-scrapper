Posted this on the Print on Demand section. Then I realized there´s hardly anything going on in there, so Ill post here as well.

Think I do know the answer to this put want to put it here anyway:

If Gondorian Spearman or a character with Spear of the Citadel defends against Smaug, will his ability prevent the dealing of 1 damage from taking place?

Along those same lines, if a character with Dwarrowdelf axe attacks, is Smaug immune to that 1 extra damage the axe does after the attack?

It does not work...

Following Calebs reply:

 

> Hi Nyck,
> Good question. Unfortunately, the Ithilien Tracker's ability will not work on Smaug because it only works on an enemy "added to the staging area." By the time Smaug is added to the staging area, it has entered play and it's immunity is active.
