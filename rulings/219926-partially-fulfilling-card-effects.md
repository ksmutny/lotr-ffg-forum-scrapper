This is a silly semantic question, but, e.g., Lembas says:

"Discard Lembas to ready attached hero and heal 3 damage from it."

I think I won't be alone in saying that I've used it to heal 2, 1, or even 0 damage, just for the hero readying. But is this technically allowed? We cannot trigger card effects if we cannot pay the cost, like Emery's action with <3 cards in deck. Can we partially fulfill the results of an effect?

There's a relevant FAQ entry that refers to encounter cards discarding resources (you do what you can), but I was just curious if there was official word at some point for player cards,

I don't think there was really any doubt about this, but for the record:

 



> In general, you do as much as you can. For example, if you have only 2 damage on Treebeard when you use Lembas to heal him, you would heal those 2 damage. With regard to Ered Nimras Prospector, you could trigger his ability to discard the top 2 cards of your deck, but you could not trigger his ‘then’ effect because the word ‘then’ means you can only do the following if everything preceding it was fully resolved. In this case you have not fully resolved his ability because you only discarded 2 cards.

(The Prospector question was for the situation when you have <3 cards left in deck.)

Elsewhere, cmabr002 asked about Mirror of Galadriel and <10 cards... It's phrased, "Exhaust Mirror of Galadriel to search the top 10 cards of your deck for a card and add it to your hand. Shuffle the rest back into your deck. Then, discard a random card from your hand." Do you have to discard a random card in this case?

Although I did not ask Caleb this specifically, in his response he does use the phrase "if everything preceding it was fully resolved", so I believe you would indeed avoid discarding a card.

I asked Caleb about such effect, so, now it is official:

1. a. Mirror of Galadriel (Exhaust Mirror of Galadriel to search the top 10 cards of your deck for a card and add it to your hand. Shuffle the rest back into your deck. Then, discard a random card from your hand.) - what if there are less than 10 cards in my deck? Can I use Mirror then? If I can, do I discard a random card from my hand then?

> You can still search your deck if there are less than 10 cards. The rule there is to do as much as you can. You  still have to discard a card from your hand since the ‘then’ portion of the effect is based on having added a card to your hand.
>
> >  b. Daeron's Runes (Action: Draw 2 cards. Then, discard 1 card from your hand.) - what if there is only 1 card left in my deck? Can I use D'sR? And should I discard then?
>
> Again, do as much as you can - draw the last card of your deck. Then discard 1 card from your hand.

So these contradict each other unless I'm misunderstanding something, right?  I guess I'll go with the more recent ruling because it was always what I thought should be the case.  I'm not really seeing a significant difference between Daeron's Runes and Ered Nimrais Prospector.
