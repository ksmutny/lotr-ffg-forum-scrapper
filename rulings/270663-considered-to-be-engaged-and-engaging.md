Hi. I'm revisiting Ruins of Belegost (I obviously hate my heroes), and have hit the following situation in a "2-player" (2 deck) game:

Lurker of the Depths ("...cannot be engaged...while in the staging area, it is considered to be engaged with each player")  attackes first player in combat phase. It gets a shadow effect from Orc of Ered Luin ("After this attack, attacking enemy engages the next player, then makes an immediate attack").

If Lurker cannot be engaged, can it engage?  Do I leave Lurker in the staging area, but give it an extra attack against player 2? Do I move Lurker from staging to player 2's area? Do I ignore the shadow, as engagement is normally mutual (so I'd assume engagement bars are too)?

I finally plucked up courage and asked my first rules question. if anyone is interested, here's the response:

"The Lurker cannot leave the staging area, which means you cannot fulfill the first part of the shadow card “engages the next.” That means the second part of the shadow effect cannot trigger because it is prefaced with the word “then” - “then makes an immediate attack.” When we use the word “then” it means that whatever follows it will not resolve unless everything that preceded it was fully resolved. So, in the situation you describe the shadow effect will fizzle because the Lurker cannot leave the staging area.
Hope you’re enjoying The Ruins of Belegost!
Cheers, Caleb"

So a lucky break!
