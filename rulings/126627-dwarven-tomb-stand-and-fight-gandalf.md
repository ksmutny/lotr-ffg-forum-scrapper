I'm pretty sure I can do this, but would just like to check.

 

I draw Dwarven Tomb at resource phase, then return Stand and Fight from my discard pile, then put Gandalf into play from my discard pile.

 

Yes?

Yeah, I know what you mean, Gibby.

 

I've gone along with FFG's ruling in my games, even though it seems wrong to me (and a lot of players). Might be worth asking Caleb if the current devs would reconsider that ruling (which is probably several years old now and made by previous devs)?

 

But I guess that's the nice thing about this game being non-competitive. You can interpret/ignore "rulings," or make your own house rules as you wish. Still, it would be nice to have consistency/coherence from the developers in the application/clarification of rules and card text.
