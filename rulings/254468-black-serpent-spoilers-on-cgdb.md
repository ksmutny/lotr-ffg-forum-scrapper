Just thought I'd let you guys the spoilers are up. What do you think of the new cards?

I had to look up Fastred. Apparently he was one of the princes of Rohan who died in the Battle of the Crossings of Poros (I see what you did there, Caleb) over 100 years before the War of the Ring.

Surely this Fastred must just be named after that one, right?

Correct. Fastred is mentioned in the song of the Mounds of Mundburg as one of the Rohirrim who died in the Battle of Pelennor Fields, but I don't think anything else is known about him.

Previously in the game we've seen Dúnhere (chieftain of Harrowdale, and Unfinished Tales mentions that he is nephew to Erkenbrand), Guthláf (Théoden's banner-bearer), Déorwine (chief of Théoden's knights), and Grimbold (who distinguished himself at both battles of the Ford of Isen, who led the muster of the West-mark after Helm's Deep, and who--like Éomer and Elfhelm--led one of the first three éoreds at the battle of Pelennor Fields). Like Fastred, I don't think we know anything else about Harding, Herefara, Herubrand, and Horn. I didn't expect to see any of them as heroes (though perhaps as allies), but the fact that Fastred shares a name (and a similar fate) with a prince buried at the Crossings of Poros (Théoden's great-uncle) likely accounts for Fastred's promtion to hero status.
