Hello,

 

i have a doubt about immediate attacks that i happen to face very often lately. Do we always deal a shadow card at the enemy or only when the card effect says it directly? When an enemy is revealed that makes an immediate attack from the staging area, do i have to deal him a shadow card?

 

And a second question similar. What about when a shadow effect says that the enemy makes an adittional attack but it doesn't say nothing about shadow cards? Some shadow cards say that i have to deal a new shadow card to the enemy but some others not. The right would be to deal shadow card but i doubt exactly because some cards DO mention it and some others NOT.

Here is a question I've asked Caleb once, maybe it'd be helpful:

 

Q: Forced effect on Black Rider: if I fail Hide test then BR will attack me "immediately". That means that 4 steps of "Resolving Enemy Attacks" must be followed. But, I think that there is no Step 1 in such attack as an enemy has already been "chosen". So, am I allowed to play Sneak Attack to put an ally card into play to declare him as a defender in this attack? Rules say I can only take actions at the end of each step. Maybe it would be better (and within the rules) to play Sneak Attack earlier, during Action window of the Hide test?

A: You are correct: there is no action window to Sneak Attack a defender into play for the first Forced attack made by a Black Rider. Your first action window would be after the Declare Defenders step. (emphasis mine) That could be significant if you find yourself engaged by more than 1 Black Rider making a Forced attack: since you resolve each attack separately, you could use Sneak Attack to put a defender into play for the second Black Rider’s attack.

Yeah, I don't see why you should have an action window before declaring a defender. The attacking enemy is already defined.

Weird that the official faq mention the 4 step... I remember seeing Caleb's answers that didn't mention the first step.

I start to be fed up with all these contradictions in the rulings.

The answer from Caleb is clearly in contradiction with the faq :

> (1.26) Enemy attacks outside of the combat phase
> 
> If an enemy attacks outside of the combat phase, it is still dealt a shadow card at the beginning of the attack. Then follow the 4 steps under Phase 6 “Combat” in the rules. Any shadow cards dealt to the attacking enemy are discarded after the attack resolves.

And sorrry the answer from Caleb make no sense for the second part of his answer :

> That could be significant if you find yourself engaged by more than 1 Black Rider making a Forced attack: since you resolve each attack separately, you could use Sneak Attack to put a defender into play for the second Black Rider’s attack.

No again, no !

If there is 2 Black riders, then you have to go through step one, so you definitely will have an opportunity to play a sneak attack before step 2, so before the first attack, not before the second one.

So, I've sent Caleb an e-mail regarding our doubts and he responded:

 

Hi Michal,
Thanks for bringing this to my attention. It looks like the answer I gave you previously was incorrect since it does contradict our FAQ. It was, however, the way that I played the scenario myself. I liked the tension it created in my games when I knew that if an enemy attacked me during the quest phase, I would not have the opportunity to respond until the attack was already underway. That way I had to think twice before committing everyone to the quest, even if I had a Sneak Attack in my hand.
Sadly, I have to concede that the ruling in the FAQ is cleaner and easier to comprehend, so I will recant my previous ruling rather than amend the FAQ. I doubt that many players will be upset like I am to know they have an action window during which time they can ready a character or Sneak Attack one into play in order to defend an immediate attack.
So, just to be clear: anytime an enemy makes an attack outside of the combat phase, you deal it a shadow card and follow all 4 steps of the ‘resolving enemy attacks’ portion of the combat phase. That also means that you have action windows after each of those 4 steps.
Cheers,
Caleb

There you have it.  Thanks for following up with Caleb.  I'm just glad that there isn't a contradiction with the FAQ.
