I won't deny that we are incredibly blessed the game lasted as long as it did, apparently for a few years beyond the initial plan. But had the game lasted one more year what would you have liked to see? Perhaps Cycle 10? Or maybe a 10 Year Anniversary Set?

For me, I'd have chosen ideally that the Vengeance of Mordor Cycle be split into two. One would be set in Rhun, and then the final cycle would be set entirely in Mordor.

Then for the 10th Anniversary, and the Final Product, it would have been nice to have Shire Set for $60. It could come with the Scouring of the Shire, and a light hearted mini-campaign in the Shire complete with chasing young hobbits away from Farmer Maggot's crops and similar mundane tasks that would serve as a stark contrast to the darkness of the Mordor Cycle. It would be nice to see New versions of Sam and Fatty. There could also be some nice loot like a Play Mat that resembled Biblo's desk with an open book.

Game is not over yet. We have a standalone scenario due out in December. Maybe, just maybe FFG will announce another product around that time.

Also, Caleb Grace in a recent episode of CotR argued that the game is already ten years old since it debuted at GenCon 2010 at a demo.
