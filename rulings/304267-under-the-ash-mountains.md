For a while I thought they just axed most of the playtesting for this game (like... a couple of cycles back) so we saw a surge in typos and fuzzy wordings that made it all the way to print.

Now I actually think it's all intentional and Caleb is trying to soften us up and stop us from caring about wording at all
