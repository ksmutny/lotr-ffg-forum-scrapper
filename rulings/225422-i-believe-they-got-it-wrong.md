I read somewhere here you can't use Elfhelm (not the new one, the other) to nullify an effect of a location by putting 1 progress on it raising your threat by 1, because yoyu only can put the progress satisfying the cost. Elfhelm, however, doesn't say he cancels threat raise by 1, he says he reduces the threat. So my theory is that you successfully raise your threat and then you reduce it, so you tecnically explore the location with zero net threat raise.

I'm surprised, but a ruling from Caleb is about as definitive as it gets, absent a later ruling reversing it.

 

So if Caleb said it worked back in 2014, who is the "they" in the OP?

Caleb and whoever else answers these rules questions at FFG? Edited July 21, 2016 by Kakita Shiro

Caleb doesn't work for "they", because Caleb agrees with the OP.
