Spoilt in the new preview, the Tactics doomed X card "Close Call". I tried to stress the point in the preview thread but since there was no answer and I am eager to be sure, I do it again: those of you confident with rules, do you think Close Call can be used to cancel damage otherwise dealt to hero Beorn? I am saying yes since it seems to work as Dori's ability, but I would like to hear others...

If so, then Close Call becomes an auto-include 3 copies in every deck with hero Beorn. I'd like to see an official ruling on this. Maybe someone can email Caleb or Matt?

Got an official ruling from Caleb:

Since Close Call targets the damage and not the hero, Beorn's immunity to player card effects would not prevent it's ability from resolving as printed.

Cheers,

Caleb
