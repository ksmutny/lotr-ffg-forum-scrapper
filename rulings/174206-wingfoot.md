Let's say we are playing with 4 players. I quest with Beravor with a wingfoot on her naming enemy. The first card from the encounter reinforcement is an enemy, but that enemy is making an immediate attack (Harad Elite for instance).

-Is beravor ready before the attack starts ?

-Can I use Beravor to block ?

-Can I use her to draw cards before declaring defender ?

After attack is finished (beravor exhausted again), the next card from encounter is another enemy :

-Does Beravor ready again ?

I do not clearly get the wingfoot action (is it a kind of response ?)

Thanks in advance

Been reading this card over and over again and it doesn't seem correct to me at point 3.

 

Response: After attached hero commits to a quest, name enemy, location, or treachery. If a card of the named type is revealed during this quest phase, ready attached hero. 

 

The card makes use of an if-statement instead of a when-statement. So the complete response would be done after readying 1 time.

 

I started to look for similar situations and consider how I would handle those. Suppose you have a quest card with the same If-construction.

 

If a treachery card is revealed during the quest phase, raise your threat by 3.

 

Within this wording, I would raise my threat with 3 if a treachery is revealed, but I would definitely not raise 3 for each treachery revealed. Any thoughts on this, or should we get straight to Caleb?

 

Kind Regards,

Jban

We need an official clarification on this topic.

I'm not sure Caleb saw the potential combo with Anborn leadership.

Seastan found a combo with Anborn but it could apply to any unique ranger character having a response needing exhaust effect during the quest phase.

This can become a design problem.

Is it just me, or does the combination of Seastan, Caleb, and combo in the same post strike fear of misguided errata in your heart?

Yes, I would raise my threat 3 for each treachery revealed. When the designers only want it to apply to the first card revealed, they use the word first.

Here is a card that does not use first. And you must perform the action whenever the condition is satisfied:

Here are more examples of cards that use the "If a..." language, that you resolve every time, not just the first time, showing that they are constant effects:

Finally, the Ruins of Belegost rules:

 

> If a card with the Loot keyword is revealed from the encounter deck, discard it and reveal another card from the top of the encounter deck.

 

Do you resolve this only for the first Loot, or for every loot? I am pretty confident of the answer here, since the quest would be broken if you could just stumble into 3 loot on the first turn, but you can send Caleb an email to confirm if you wish.
