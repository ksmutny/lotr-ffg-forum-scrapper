You can avoid the forced of Smaug the Magnificent by Rider of the Mark hability?

 

The text of the ally is: Response: After Rider of the Mark changes control, discard a shadow card dealt to an enemy you are engaged with.

 

And the text of Smaug: If Smaug the Magnificent is dealt a shadow card with a burgle effect, he makes an additional attack immediately after this one.

 

Smaug is immune to player cards effects. Is immune also to the text of Rider of the Mark?

 

PD: one question: which enemy is his shadow card discarded, the enemy of new controler or the old controler?

Okay, just dug up an old question answer I sent regarding Smaug which may have some bearing. 

 

My question(s):

> These questions concern the forced effect on Smaug the Magnificent in "The Lonely Mountain" Quest ("If Smaug the Magnificent is dealt a shadow card with a burgle effect, he makes an additional attack immediately after this one") and ways in which the players might deal with it. 
> 
> 1) Can a player play "Dawn take you all" before the shadow card is revealed in order to remove it? [it's not clear to me whether or not Smaug's being immune to player card effect extends to the shadow cards that are dealt to him.]
> 
> 2) Is the forced effect a "shadow effect" that is triggered when the shadow card has a burgle effect? To be more specific:
> a) Can Balin pay a resource to replace the shadow card with another card?
> b) Can "Hasty Stroke" be played to counteract the forced effect?
> c) Could Dunedain Watcher be discarded in order to counteract the forced effect?

 

Caleb's answer:

>  
> 
> Thanks for writing. Really glad to hear you're enjoying the game!
> To answer your questions:
> 1. Yes. If you discard the shadow card dealt to Smaug before it is revealed, then it cannot trigger his Forced effect.
> 2. No. "Shadow effects" are always denoted by the text: "Shadow: ..." 
> a, b, c - All no, because they cancel shadow effects and not Forced effects. 
> Cheers,
> Caleb

 

Worth noting:

 * You cannot play Hasty Stroke to stop the second attack as it targets a shadow effect and not a forced effect.
 * Since you can play use "Dawn Take you All" I'll reverse my opinion here and say you can also use Rider of the Mark, provided you do so before the card is revealed.  Once you reveal the card, then it's too late to stop the forced effect (e.g. same situation as what I asked concerning discarding Dunedain Watcher)

May I ask how old was the question ? FAQ 1.5 changed the ruling of immunity as Caleb said we could attach cards on immuned locations before but 1.5 prevent it.

 

 

> I'm gonna have to stick by my original answer.  The shadow card is not Smaug, it's got to be a separate entity with its own distinct presence on the table.  You can target any shadow card on the table without simultaneously targeting the enemy to which it was dealt.  

 

The same was said for attachement. And everything changed, when the FAQ 1.5 attacked came out.

If the question was pre-faq 1.5, it could be worth to ask again.

 

Edit : relevant FAQ entries :

 

>  
> 
> Q: Can I play an attachment on an enemy or location
> 
> that is immune to player card effects.
> 
> A: No. Playing an attachment on a card is a form

And the part of the card of Dawn Take you All I suspect is a "form of targeting" :

 

> Combat Action: Each player may choose and discard 1 facedown shadow card from an enemy with which he is engaged.

The question was asked on May 6 of this year.  If you suspect that FAQ 1.5 changes things I'd suggest re-submitting a question.   I still think things are valid though, as I don't believe Smaug's immunity extends to the encounter deck cards attached to him.

Is this still the current ruling on whether or not you can discard shadow cards from Smaug the Magnificent?

 

It would certainly make it easier to win more consistently if you can, but my friend and I did not include any such cards in our decks because we thought they were a form of targeting and thus would not be useable against Smaug the Magnificent.  Currently, all the cards that discard shadow cards mention the enemy in some way.  If a card simply said "discard a shadow card from play" then it clearly would not be targeting.

 

Losing your entire army to chained burgle effects currently has no answer unless you are allowed to discard the shadow card, though.  So hopefully Caleb's original ruling is still current.
