I think I know the answer to this one, but what do people think?

 

Stage 2B of To Catch an Orc reads: "Response: After questing successfully, cancel all progress that would be placed on this stage. Then, place 1 time counter on this stage. Or, if Mugash is in play, advance to stage 3."

 

My interpretation of the "Then" clause [see the "Ered Nimrais" thread for lengthy discussion and official ruling] is that, if you have quested successfully but were not going to place any progress on the stage (because of an active location), therefore the "Then" clause will fail because no progress has been cancelled. Does this sound right? It passes the "make things harder for the player" test.

We should definitely get a ruling for this. This can make a really big difference during this quest stage. Most decks will be able to quest successfully, but it take a serious willpower deck to always put progress on the quest stage. Once the time goes off early in the game, you will probably never quest successfully again, and it is pretty much game over, that plus encounter cards potentially removing tokens makes it a really tough feat to accomplish. I'm fine if that's how it should be played, since that's the way i have been playing it, but it just limits the types of decks I will try against it.

I have sent in a few rules question already, anyone else care to bug Caleb?

Do you think developers ever read these forums? Would be real nice if they just ironed this stuff out rather than us all sit around and speculate. It would be a real nice thing for them do especially right after the AP or expansion was released, they should expect to see players questions at that time?

It really does make a massive difference! I can ask Caleb if you tell me how? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
If you do need to place progress on the actual stage I fear I'll never beat the quest =( 
Got close to beating it last night playing that you just have to quest successfully.... killed his single guard (playing two handed) and had the staging area more or less clear only to have Orc Hunter and Take Cover surge together into four cards on the turn Mugash himself came out (asfaloth got him out via search, then I quested), leading to an unsuccessful questing phase, time counters running out and me getting utterly smashed by half the enemies in the deck coming out all at once.....
It seems I was not quiet enough while hunting the fearsome orc captain and ended up alerting his entire personal guardwho proceeded to feed me to orc hounds
