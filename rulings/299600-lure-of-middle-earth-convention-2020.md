It is time to for new adventures my friends!

The next Lure of Middle-earth Convention will be held on March 6th to 8th 2020. And starting next Saturday (7th September, UTC+2) you will be able to pre-register a room at the castle.

This is an event in Europe. About 120 people meet at a castle in Germany to play Lord of the Rings based games. Over 40 Lord of the Rings LCG players joined the event last year.

Three news for the next event: 
1) We are proud to announce that Lord of the Rings LCG Lead Designer Caleb Grace will return as a guest of honor. 
2) We will offer a dormitory for women only. 
3) We will extend our last year very successful Marathon Challenge!

Hi, I will write in English just in case someone else might need these info, but we are also from Italy (Bologna to be precise) and last year we flew to Frankfurt (the nearest airport), then took a rental car from there to the castle. We could have gotten from Frankfurt to town beneath the castle by train, but taking in account the costs (we found a cheap rental) and the comfort of arriving/departing whenever needed with the car (not to mention avoiding the climb from the town to the castle with the luggage) we decided for that solution.

We will almost certainly go with that again next year so if you might be interested in some car share (and we can fit the timing) let us know.

Most are, but it depends, since a few people who organize/partecipate in events bring their own cards so sometimes you find cards in French, or German (or Italian in our case)

It's really an amazing experience, highly recommended. Last year we ended up playing a few games of Fire in the Night with Caleb Grace and it was a blast. Also the Drinking Game is really fun.
