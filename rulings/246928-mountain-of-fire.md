There's so much I love about how Caleb's designed this box.

I thought that the battle at the Black Gate and Mount Doom might be combined into the final quest, but to accommodate solo players Frodo's story might get short shrift (after a Ringbearer-focused Gorgoroth quest, perhaps Frodo would be in a separate area like the Riddle area in Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim). This approach is so much better. It allows both quests to tell their own rich stories, and I expect Epic Multiplayer Mode allows the Aragorn team to (like in the books) make things more difficult for themselves but easier for Frodo.

Slight digression: what I care most about in the Saga expansions is being able to relive LotR's story, which means I sometimes change the number of players during a campaign, to better reflect the story (in the Flame of the West, the first two quests are solo with my Grey Company deck, and the third quest is played with three players, adding a Gondor deck and a Rohan deck). I hope it will be possible in Epic Multiplayer Mode for teams to have different numbers of players: I'd like to play Frodo solo, with Aragorn's team having perhaps three players. That would likely mean that the Frodo player has to wait each round for the Aragorn players to finish, but for me that would be the ultimate way to recreate the story.

Last of the Company will work well on Sam, since it can lower an enemy's threat by the attached hero's willpower. It looks like it's intended only for The Tower of Cirith Ungol, so we probably won't have the option of playing through the campaign with an alternate Ring-bearer. The first player token doesn't rotate during that quest (except perhaps after Frodo is rescued), which avoids the awkwardness of (for example) losing your only leadership hero in a multiplayer game.

Aragorn has all the traits (including Gondor!) except Ranger. This is the first character we've seen with more than three traits (which is relevant for the upcoming The Free Peoples card), and also the only Aragorn without the Ranger trait. It fits thematically, since Aragorn is now a captain going to war, but it could be a problem for anyone who put the Forewarned boon on Aragorn (unless they gave him Tireless Ranger as well). The boon has the Permanent keyword, so you can't shift it to another hero, but I don't think you can attach it to Aragorn if he doesn't have the Ranger trait.

I love that we're getting ally versions of the twins, and they have amazing art. I expect several combinations of the twins will work well. One of the most interesting might be hero Elrohir with ally Elladan. A Lore hero helps with the card draw to find Elladan early, and hero Elrohir can be an excellent defender (although he might want Tactics for Elven Mail or Spirit for ally Arwen). I expect it would be difficult to consistently get Elladan into play round one or two, however, and early defense can be crucial. Hero Elladan with ally Elrohir seems lower risk but lower reward, since ally Elrohir isn't an amazing defender (though Narya and ally Arwen can certainly help). Playing both ally versions is probably only great if the quest has a decent number of Orc enemies.

Three Golden Hairs and Brace of Coneys are the only Boon cards so far that can reduce threat, so it might be worth keeping them for the final quests. Hero Galadriel and ally Elfhelm might be useful in these quests. I hope that it will be possible to use a secrecy approach for Mount Doom: thematically, I'd like to minimize combat for Frodo and Sam. Orc Disguise likely helps with that, and in Epic Multiplayer Mode Aragorn's team might be able to reduce Frodo's threat or draw enemies away from Frodo. The spoiled treachery can increase threat by 10, so I expect that the quest will punish high threat (aside from enemy engagement) well before 99. Neither A Test of Will nor The Black Riders version of Frodo can cancel the first treachery each round during stage one, so Fortitude tests (and deciding whether to exhaust the One Ring) will be important. I wonder whether Fortitude tests depend primarily on Willpower or something else (perhaps partly resources, since this version of Frodo can gain resources). I also wonder whether the Wraith on Wings burden will be used in the Frodo quests or in the Aragorn quest. I expect that there will be no more than four Nazgûl enemies in the encounter decks during the last two quests, since the quests happen simultaneously and there are only eight Nazgûl remaining.

I am super excited about this expansion, and looking forward to playing the complete saga campaign.

Thanks for the detailed look into the possibilities. It got me reflecting, and I posted a detailed comment in response.

In summary, I noticed that Saga heroes almost always share a racial trait with any ally that shares their sphere in the same release. This is an ironclad rule since Treason of Saruman. (Road Darkens doesn't have any neutral allies. Bill the Pony and Barliman Butterbur are technically exceptions, but they interact with the hobbit trait. The only clear exception is way back in the first Saga expansion, with Beorn and Bofur.) If this rule is followed in The Mountain of Fire, I predict that we will get Leadership Éomer and Tactics Gwaihir heroes, with Leadership Elfhelm and Tactics Meneldor allies. Elfhelm's the most questionable, since we already have him twice (though not in Saga). I could see him being replaced by someone from Gondor: perhaps Húrin the Tall, Angbor the Fearless, Bergil, or even Pippin. Hirgon could also work, as someone who might interact with the Rohan trait, though he dies before the Battle of Pelennor Fields.

Alternatively, if Caleb decides to repeat a saga hero for the first time (Flame of the West repeated a core set hero, at least partly because Spirit Éowyn was not great at her big moment of killing the Witch-king; I think Leadership Sam should work well for Cirith Ungol), we could get Leadership Éomer and Tactics Sam heroes, with Leadership Merry and Tactics Pippin allies. Merry would share the Rohan trait with Éomer, and Pippin would share the Hobbit trait with Sam.

I agree that we won't get Merry unless we get Pippin, and it seems unlikely that we get no eagles. Éomer and Gwaihir heroes with Merry and Pippin allies might work, although obviously Gwaihir and Pippin wouldn't match traits.

Widfara to me would feel a bit anticlimactic in the final saga box. I think Erkenbrand was crowded out of the saga because there were arguably more important Rohan characters at Helm's Deep (Háma and Gamling), and the quest focuses on the defense, not the reinforcements. At Pelennor Fields, the main Rohan commanders (under Théoden) were Éomer, Elfhelm, and Grimbold, and Elfhelm is more present in the story than Erkenbrand is. Also, Elfhelm was fighting in Anórien while Aragorn went to the Black Gate. Ally Elfhelm is not a weak card, but is niche, so I could see us getting another version.

All that said, I would not be at all surprised to see Caleb break the matching trait rule and give us a Leadership Gondor ally together with Éomer, especially since Rohan and Gondor are fully allied at this point. Pippin is certainly possible, though it might feel weird to get Pippin without Merry. Bergil and Húrin are, in my mind, the other likely candidates.

@Authraw [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/229935-authraw/], now that you've had a chance to play through the quests, I'd love it if you gave us some initial impressions. I also have a few specific questions: are there any new boons or burdens? Is Wraith on Wrings included for The Tower of Cirith Ungol? This is a bit spoilery, so I don't necessarily want all the details, but how did you find Mount Doom handled Gollum? Specifically, was he able to help in some way with the final Fortitude check? Did players have the option to kill him/remove him from play for short term advantage, but then lose the benefit he would provide for the final check?

@Slothgodfather [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/181150-slothgodfather/], I intend to have 3 players for The Black Gate Opens and 1 for Mount Doom in my thematic campaign, using Epic Multiplayer Mode. Apparently Caleb said he liked 4 and 2, and it makes sense to have more players in an epic battle and fewer for a quest focused on keeping your threat low.
