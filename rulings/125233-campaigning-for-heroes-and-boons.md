Been away from forums for awhile because my "Dunland Trap" was VERY late and I didn´t want spoilers so don´t know if these questions have been answered:

 

1)

In saga play (dark riders, road darkens) when you change a hero between scenarios the group takes a +1 threat penalty as a result. But what if you later in the campaign change back to a hero you used in the early scenarios? His name still appears on the "list of heroes" after all. Would that incur the threat penalty?

 

2)

If you do change back and forth between heroes, regardless of the threat penalty, would a hero who earlier had earned a permanent boon come back with that boon still attached? (I am thinking that he will still have his boon)

 

3)

When a hero gets defeated all permanent boon cards are discarded from him. Would they come back to him if that hero was brought back with FaF? Or Landroval for that matter? (I would think the boon gets reattached)

 

4)

If an effect instructs a player to "discard a non-objective attachment" and you choose (or have no choice) a permanent boon, is that boon lost for good? (leaning towards a permanent loss)

 

5)

The "Mr. Underhill" boon can be reused from one scenario to the next? (think it can be reused by the wording; the card does not mention it must be removed from campaign pool. But it does not seem very thematic to me)

Regarding permanent boons (#3), I' ve recently asked Caleb same question, so here is official answer:

 

Q. When I sacrifice a hero on the Great Bridge and that hero has permanent boon attached, what happens with this boon card when I bring that hero back to play by Fortune or Fate? Is it again attached to him? In rules there is written: “If a hero leaves play, attachments with the permanent keyword attached to that hero are removed from the game", so maybe this boon is lost for good, as it is not just discarded but removed?
A: In that situation, the permanent attachment is removed from the game, but not from the campaign pool. It will be reattached at the beginning of the next scenario.
