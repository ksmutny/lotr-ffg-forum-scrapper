I am willing to bet that with the article mentioning a Dwarf hero, and with Thorin's art in the promo cards for pre-ordering this pack, we can be pretty confident it is the same Thorin Stonehelm that we got in the 2 player set. Caleb even confirmed that the heroes in that box would make an appearance at one point, and this cycle would have been in development at the same time. With pack 2 having a Spirit hero, it would also make sense that this pack would have a Tactics hero. So all signs point to Thorin, even though we haven't seen his non-alt card form in the article yet.
Will likely mean that our second Leadership hero in this cycle will be Gildor, who I really want to put into my decks already!
