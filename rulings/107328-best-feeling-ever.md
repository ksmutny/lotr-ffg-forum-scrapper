Inspired by DurinIII's "worst feeling ever" topic.

Best feeling: buying a new pack with a card you've been eagerly awaiting, unboxing it at home and mixing it into your deck.

And winning a difficult scenario, of course.

What's your best feeling in this game?

Many may scoff but every moment with this game - even the frustrating moments - is simply superb. Nate and Caleb have truly created an immersive game with sound mechanics and dripping with theme.
