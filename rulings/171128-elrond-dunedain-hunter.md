Quick question:

Can I just toss dunedain hunter in any deck when playing the Elrond hero?

I think yes, but Elrond states 'pay' and dunedain hunter has 0 cost.

Good question.  Not sure.  There is a good chance that the answer is no.  It has previously been ruled [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/90737-using-a-good-harvest-with-0-cost-cards/?hl=%2Bgood+%2Bharvest] that Good Harvest cannot be used for a resource match for 0-cost cards because the card specifically states you can "spend" resources from any sphere to "pay" for cards from the named sphere:

 

"A Good Harvest does not allow players to play 0 cost cards without a resource match. Since you are not using any resources to pay for the card, the ability of A Good Harvestdoes not apply and you still need a resource match.

Cheers,

Caleb"

Thanks for the replies guys.

I did not remember the ruling on a good harvest until I read your reply GS.

It's a odd bit of wording really.

One way or the other actually could be possible imo. Hence I asked.

Yet following the words exactly, this ruling is the right choice from Caleb imo.

And indeed the case is the same in my question as teamjimby stated.

I agree in that it is not possible.
