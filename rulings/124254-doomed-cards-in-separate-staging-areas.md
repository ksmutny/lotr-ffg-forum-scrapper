When the players are divided into separate staging areas, will Doomed player cards raise the threat of all players, or only those players who are sharing a staging area where the Doomed card was played?

 

I assume it's the latter, but wanted to run it by you all.

You might very well be right (Seastan often is).  By hair-splitting, I meant that it is such an edge case (one specific quest, a handful of specific player cards) and it has a minor effect on the game, so I would just apply the golden rule of assuming the worst.  But if you want official clarification, I suggest asking Caleb.

I asked Caleb.
