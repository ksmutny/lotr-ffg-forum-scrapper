So i had to ask some of these like a week ago but i didn't have time or i forgotted, but now finally i can ask these things.

 

If Murzag attacks and reveals an enemy, do i have to resolve the revealed enemy's attack too and if i have to, does it attack to the current defender (if there is one), can i decleare new defender or is that attack undefend?

What happens if there are equal number of tokens on the dead villagers and the rescued villagers?

If trechery card is revealed from the encounter deck and i cancel it with test of will, does Gondorian hamlet's forced effect trigger?

Can someone clarify me this card's shadow effect as detailed as possible? It's really confusing to me.

If Morgul sorcerer would have been dealt to an enemy as shadow card and i would choose this attack undefend, could i choose any of my heroes as an target of attack or would the attacking enemy attack to a hero that was defending the attack?

And then final question: Can i use test of will to a treachery card with a keyword, before resolving any of it's keywords? (i knew this once but i don't remeber it anymore)

> Morgul Bodyguard shadow effect (and many other shadow effects like it): after you finish the attack (placing damage tokens on your defender as necessary), move the attacking enemy to the next player (it engages the next player), deal it a new shadow card, and immediately resolve its attack.  The attacked player may choose a defender, or leave the attack undefended, as per usual.  After that attack, finish resolving any other enemies' attacks as per usual.  The "next player" is whoever would get the first player token after the person who is being attacked.  So it the first player triggers the shadow effect, the 'next player' is whoever gets the first player token next.  In a solo game, there is no 'next player' and this shadow effect does nothing.

Grandspleen this does not match with official answer from Caleb. https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/94076-morgul-bodyguard-shadow-effect/#entry918167 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/94076-morgul-bodyguard-shadow-effect/#entry918167]

Difference is in the word immediately.
