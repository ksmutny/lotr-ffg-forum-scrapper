Apologies if this is answered in some buried thread...

 

Black Riders, A Shadow of the Past, Stage 2, A Shortcut to Mushrooms

 

"When a player fails a Hide test, each Nazgul enemy in the staging area engages that player."

 

Okay.

 

You're staging. Card from encounter deck is revealed, a Nazgul (Black Rider)

 

"Hide 2. Cannot have non-Morgul attachments.

Forced: After engaged player fails a Hide test, Black Rider makes an immediate attack."

 

You do the Hide test. You fail it.

 

Does this Black Rider you have in your hand engage you (per Stage 2A) or not?

 

I believe it does not: it is not in the staging area, as it is being revealed still.

But some folks on other threads seem to think it will engage you.

Good point.

I used to also engage the just revealed Nazgul, but by strictly following the rules, considering he will indeed enters the staging area after resolving the hide/when revealed, he should probably not engage.

This makes the quest much more easier I guess, and is a bit odd thematically: why failing a hide would let you avoid that actual Nazgul ?

Moreover, if no Nazgul is lurking in the staging area, you don't even have to try to succeed the hide test then.

I guess he was designed to engage you, but I cannot figure how to explain it with the rules.

You should send the question to Caleb.

Well, those of you suspecting the intent of the designer... you win! (I just figured it was so obvious that staging area != card in hand...)

 

> Your interpretation of the timing is correct. Unfortunately, that’s not how the scenario is intended to work. When a Black Rider is revealed and you fail its Hide 2 test, it is meant to engage you and attack. I think everyone involved in developing this scenario understood this intent so intuitively that no one bothered to scrutinize the timing as closely as you have.
