Seeing as The Black Riders will be released in a couple of months if not earlier, I wanted to ask you all what would you especially like to see in this expansion, be it in terms of lore, mechanics, player card quality and traits, etc

 

Well, the first thing I would love to see in this expansion is obviously the Barrow-downs and the Barrow-wights, but I fear that we will not get that in the Black Riders. Also, I would like to see some encounter card interaction with the Ring-bearer trait since so many if not all of the scenarios in the LOTR saga expansions will be played with a ring-bearer.

I'll start by stating the obvious; Bombadil, Goldenberry, Oldman Willow.

 

Also some of the more less-known characters as Unique allies.

Not all hobbits are fit to be in the game, but there are the patrols (Sam's friend or cousin who have claimed to have seen a walking tree springs to my mind), some of Bilbo's relatives and friends that are good with lore (Rory Brandybuck or someone named similar that guessed Bilbo's true intention during 111th party).

If Hirluin could be a hero, those hobbits can certainly be an ally atleast.

 

And perhaps most importantly, artwork that are beautiful and true to the book.

I was very happy to see Sam with scar on his scalp. I've almsot forgotten he was wounded when he killed his first Orc in Moria, but Caleb and other developers remembered.
