If I use Gandalf's resource to play Quick Strike off the top of my deck, can I use Gandalf's resource pool to play other event cards, like Mithrandir's advice, during the attack?

> The action on Quick strike says to exhaust your character and declare it as an attacker.  After you declared your attacker, you are no longer playing the card and Gandalf loses his icons. There is no action window during the attack declaration to play another card.

There is an action window after you declare attackers, after you determine attack strength, and after you determine combat damage.  Quick Strike is as you say + "and resolve it's attack" for this reason you are still playing the card until it's over. Caleb confirmed this is why Hama can't take a quick strike back immediately but can take a Fient back. The card quick strike sticks around until the attack is over then goes in the discard pile.

Found the Hama quote:

"The card that you want to retrieve with Hama must already be in the discard pile at the time that he is declared as the attacker. In the case of Quick Strike or Hands Upon the Bow, those cards are not are not discarded until their effect (the attack) resolves, so they wouldn't be in the discard pile for Hama to retrieve."

 

So Quick Strike is not discarded until after the attack, but I don't think the card is in a constant state of being played.  If you want to ask Caleb, go for it.  I'd be very surprised if he said it unlocked Gandalf's spheres into a new action window.

> I can't find that Hama ruling anywhere, but I did find this question below.  This indicates that playing an event and discarding an event after it resolves are two different steps.  So even if you don't discard Quick Strike until after the attack, playing the card is something different.

If that is possible, should we shuffle Will of the West and Map of Earnil in the deck without putting the Will of the West at the bottom of the deck? Also, if we use a good meal with a leadership hobbit hero, could we lower the cost to play second breakfast while it is played from the discard using the Tome of Atanator?[/size]

> A[/size]: When you play an event in The Lord of the Rings LCG, you resolve its ability and then discard it. So when you play Will of the West, you will shuffle your discard pile into your deck before discarding it. If you used Map of Earnil to play Will of the West, you will place it on the bottom of your deck instead. While the event is being resolved, it is neither in your hand nor in your discard pile. This is similar to treachery cards revealed from the encounter deck: the When Revealed effect on the treachery card must be resolved before it is discarded. During that time, the treachery card is neither in the encounter deck or encounter discard pile.[/size]

Lol that was my exact thread asked to Caleb. He said the feint goes right in discard but quick str does not because it says "and resolve it's attack"
