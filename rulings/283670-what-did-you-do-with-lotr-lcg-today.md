I'm sort of trying to create a thread similar to those on car forums. Basically, you state what you have done with the game. Did you play? If so, what quest and how did it go? Did you buy new expansions or adventure packs? Did you buy new sleeves? Did you re-organize your cards or working on a new storage/organizer solution? Anything that you did related to the game, you can share in this thread. I'm looking to create a thread that hopefully gets updated daily so we have something to read about every day. I'm curious to find out what you all do with Lotr LCG.

To start off, last night I built the encounter deck for the 2nd Khazad-dum quest, The Seventh Level.

This morning I ordered the On the Doorstep playmat from FFG. It should arrive next week. I might even hold off on playing the 2nd Khazad-dum quest until it arrives, since I'm using a Dwarf deck for the quests :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Played against a warg/troll custom encounter deck using the cards from Wizard's Quest and Woodland Realm. I only played it once, but those wargs were relentless! A lot of the them have effects that key off having a shadow card with no shadow effect, so many kept bouncing back to the staging area or making additional attacks. Very annoying. In fact 11 of the 35 cards have no shadow effects. The subtle design from Caleb to have it be so synergistic using quick build mode is quite impressive. (I quick build using these seven encounter set: 6, 11, 12, 16, 22, 23, 28).

Going to try out the other encounter decks later this week, one with spiders, another with orcs, and the last one being an evil deck of doomed and surging nonsense and a Nazgul. All 4 of these are built at once (no shared cards), so that's awesome. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

We played a couple of times Fire in the Night at the Lure of Middle Earth convention with Caleb Grace and it was awesome. He is a really cool guy :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

It's great to hear Caleb is a great guy.

But what would be really spectacular is if he dropped hints about future heroes/cards/cycles.
