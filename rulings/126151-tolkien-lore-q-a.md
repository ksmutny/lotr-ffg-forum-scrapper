Thought this would be a cool thread idea... Tolkien lore question and answer ... this isnt me answering lore questions (my knowledge or arrogance doesnt run so deep :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]) but for the whole forum... if you wonder something on LOTR or related material, ask, and the forum shall answer (hopefully :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])

 

Giants... what exactly were they? i mean, we have trolls which are corruptions of ents, orcs are corruption of elves, wargs i assume (?) are corruptions of wolves...  but giants are only mentioned once and in the hobbit..and as far as i know tolkien never returns to them, or their alliegance in LOTR..we only know they at least help him periodically block up goblin cave entrances

 

so perhaps, if they arent of 'evil' then they are creatures in their own right... but i dont remember a reference to them in the creation of creatures in silmarillion.

 

any ideas?

> That's really cool. I think the designers have enough material to make a northern Rhovanion cycle, and they could even make a Woodmen and Beorning subtheme for the player cards. Imagine a quest about defending a woodmen village from orcs or drakes or something like that. It'd be amazing.

I second that. And I honestly can't see any reason not to go there next cycle. There's no way we're going to Rhun or Harad -- for which the lore is scarce and even if that'd be amazing -- before we go into Rhovanion again (we visited some of those places during The Hobbit saga expansion true, but that would not be the first overlap between Sagas and regular cycles).

Also this is a great opportunity to get real faction out of Dale, Beorning and Woodmen. I'd be very curious to see how Matt and Caleb expand on the very rare lore we have about them to create interesting traits synergy and flavor. They honestly did a nice job withthe Dunlendings.
