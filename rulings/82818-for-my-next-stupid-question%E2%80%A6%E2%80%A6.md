given i was wrong about a question i thought i was right in thinking…..i though id do a double check here

when a card says for instance 'deal x damage to an ally you control' and x =3. if i have a 2 hit  point ally i dont mind sacrificing, am i right in thinking that i can put all of the 3 damage on that 2 hit point ally, without overspill….unless of course its that troll for instance

thanks

I think that's OK -- that's how I play it anyway.  Likewise, Dori can intercept an entire attack, right?  If the attack does 5 damage, Dori can take the whole thing and die, without having 2 damage left over for the original target.  Yes?



thanks grandspleen. i sent for an official just in case.

Hi Richard,
If a card instructs you to deal 3 damage to a single ally and the chosen ally only has 1 or 2 hit points, then that ally is killed and nothing else happens. The rest of the damage is excess, and the only time excess damage is assigned to characters is when a card specifically instructs players to do so.
Cheers,
Caleb
