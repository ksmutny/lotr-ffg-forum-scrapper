So with the AtS player card awards thread up in the forums (I refuse to post in that thread because my choices have already been posted many times and if I did it would just be redundant), I wanted to make a thread in which you can post in a paragraph or two your final general impressions of the cycle, your opinions of the player cards, the quests, the story and the overall quality of the cycle.

 

I'll begin by saying that I really enjoyed AtS in terms of quests (this cycle plus HoN is the first one in which I've been completely "involved" in the game from the start). The best part about it for me have been the scenarios themselves, they have been the best ones so far and the most enjoyable with all the battle and siege questing which I like (specially for tactics), and we've got a good mix of easy, medium and hard scenarios. The story as well is great (unsurprising, since it's probably the aspect they wanted to push the most), and the theme and locations i.e. Gondor and its surroundings, has been so far my favorite in the game.

 

Now, on the other hand I think that the player cards have been the weakest aspect of this cycle. Dwarrodelf gave us so many amazing cards for so many types of decks that to be honest I cannot help but be dissapointed with the player cards of AtS. The mono sphere focus is certainly nice but I still think that the support for mono sphere is a bit lacking. I've made mono sphere decks of all four spheres but not really because of the Books of the 2-cost events but rather becasue the card pool is just large enough to support them. The mono sphere "cycles" have been pretty much accesory to the building of monosphere decks rather than the main reason to build them, which I don't like.

 

And then, of course, you have Outlands. When HoN and AtS were first announced, I was hyped to build Gondor themed decks. And now that the cycle is over I can't help but to feel cheated. I'm not really an Outlands hater (though I still feel they are way too overpowered) but I really wanted to see more support for Gondor. And apart from the gondorian rangers which I think were a success, the lack of good Leadership Gondor allies is really dissapointing. So yeah, Visionary leadership turns Boromir into a gondorian Dain which is good, but the gondorian allies themselves are just so weak stat-wise that it's just not worth it (and the ONE ally that could have redeemed the trait for me, Knight of Minas Tirith, DOESN'T work with Boromir. BOO). I guess I just hate that Outlands had all the support that Gondor should have had, and that's my main and final thought about this cycle.

 

Well, that was longer than I had thought it would be, so what about you? What did you think of AtS in general?

As usual, I share many views with Richard.

 

Osgiliath is my favourite art of the cycle, too. But I liked it overall, Amon Dín has some great locations too.

 

One pack I could totally do without is Steward's Fear. It is here where the Outlands come, and I wish they were gone and had a few more Gondor stuff instead. That quest for me is the worst ever, and one I will surely not replay. It is a great trouble to even set up and then it goes on forever - Caleb should have placed the time mechanic on himself that time.

 

But otherwise, though I still haven't played the conclusion, this has been the best cycle yet. The player cards, outside of the terrible Outlands, were interesting, often innovative, and nicely powered with really no obvious choice save a few like Visionary Leadership for Gondor (but it was most needed for the faction lacking in willpower).

 

Also the quests were new, though made for coop (and I really think it is the idea now, I believe they hardly even play test much for solo play). Drúadan Forest is nasty and certainly blunts some old tricks. Osgiliath is great and very unique. And overall, what really is nice for me that there are new ways to win scenarios. Tactics can suddenly win, even on its own sometimes.
