The competitive LCGs will have their new rotation policy, The rotation will help them a lot in balance and metagame experience.

 

Maybe we don't need balance between players and encounter decks, because the quest is becoming more and more difficult along the card pool becomes bigger, and we have nightmare decks to "fix" the difficulty of old quests.

 

And we also don't care the balance among the different spheres, because the sphere is different from the house in Aogt LCG and company/hacker in Netrunner, we can put any numbers of spheres and cards in a single deck.

 

BUT, there're still some problems because of balance, like infinity resources, infinity drawing, infinity will power...In some decks they can occur easily, and maybe occur one after another, like the "powerful' Bilbo Baggins/Beravor/Bombur Deck.

 

They are boring, they can mean lowset score but the score means little thing, we don't use them. But I think they should be fixed. We cannot use "Other LCGs have the same problems" to comfort ourselves(or maybe just myself) because they begin to roll.

 

Finally I want to say that we play Lotr LCG becasuse it is the lotr and it is LCG. I hope I can feel the middle earth and feel great card game machanism in this game.

 

Best wishes to all of you. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

As I see it, a second edition for LotR would have to address a few things to be viable and a positive move for the game:

 

 * Clear up rules / errata.  The growing list of errata and increasingly complex rules could stand to be incorporated better into the core game rules and cards themselves.  This would make the game more accessible for new consumers.
 * Promise of new encounter content.  Similar to how Caleb and Matt have approached revitalizing the scenarios by pushing new mechanics and punishing common play styles, the designers must be confident that new, dynamic scenarios can be developed regularly with the same depth of connection to the Middle-earth lore.  Rehashing more treks through Moria is just dangerous.  
 * New directions for the player cards.  It won't be good enough to just republish modified versions of existing player cards and exclude the old ones from play.  They'll need to cultivate new mechanics and new types of synergy and honestly, I don't know how they would do that without treading on aspects of the game that have been extremely successful so far.  After all, a new Aragorn is going to be compared to the old Aragorn(s).  Every card with a recognizable thematic hook into the old game would lead to comparisons and probably divide the community.

 

With this said, Magic The Gathering has done this a few times already and while I'm not intimately familiar with their design decisions, it seems to have worked for quite a long run.  I'm sure lessons from that game could apply here.

 

I would personally love to see a First Age edition of the game which would give the ability for all these issues to be addressed, but that's sidestepping the premise.
