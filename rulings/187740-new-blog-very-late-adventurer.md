I've been a huge fan of this game, but I have a little secret - rarely play yet I keep buying everything... @_@ I decided to finally start playing this game for real and catalog my journey to play every quest do date. I started this blog to share my thoughts and experiences, but also to keep myself honest and stick to my goal.

 

I play exclusively on Easy mode and I don't build decks, I net deck instead. I just want to get in and play and not lose so much, and I'm not afraid to admit it. This is an Easy mode blog for all intents and purposes. I invite everyone to check it out, even if you only play Nightmare mode. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Glad to see people are enjoying it. (I was a bit nervous sharing haha). It's very motivational! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I find Easy mode to be one of the best things to happen to this game since it's inception, 2nd only to Matt and Caleb's awesome design. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
