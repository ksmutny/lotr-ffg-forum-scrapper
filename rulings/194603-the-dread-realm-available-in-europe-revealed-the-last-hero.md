Yesterday I bought the last AP of The Lost Realm cycle:  The Dread Realm!

Here is the last HERO.

What do you think about? I really love the image!

> I really wish she had 1 defense and 8 threat so I could use her as a replacement for Glorfindel in secrecy decks with guaranteed access to Elrond's Council.  As it stands now, there is no way to get 20 starting threat with her and two non-Glorfindel heroes.

 

You see everything through "Secrecy glasses," my friend!

I think yes-- Caleb has said that, when designing Nightmare packs, he watches video playthroughs of quests to see what strategies players are using, then designs cards to counter them.  In the same way, perhaps they like to force us into using different cards other than our staples.  But then again, if we have a hero for once-mentioned obscure characters like Dunhere, then Arwen was long overdue for a hero card herself.
