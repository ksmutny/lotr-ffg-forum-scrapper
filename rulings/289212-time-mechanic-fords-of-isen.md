So am I right in saying that the time mechanic, for any quest stage other than 1A, you are basically starting at 1 less than what is printed? For example, I passed stage 1 but couldn't advance until I took control of Grima. Can't take control of Grima until I have no enemies engaged. So during combat I defeated the last enemy, took control of Grima and immediately then advance to stage 2. Stage 2 has a "time" mechanic and the time counter goes down at the end of the refresh phase....and refresh is my next step. This happens again between stage 2 and 3.  Since you cannot advance to the next stage until at least completing the quest phase, you will reduce the time counter by 1 on the new stage before you ever get a chance to quest on the new stage.

I think this recent ruling about the placing of progress can be helpful in regard to this question

In particular this phrase from Caleb "you will resolve any effects that trigger as a result of the active location being explored before placing any progress on the quest"

This would imply that Grima is freed and progress can be placed on stage two, but Grima must be "free of encounters" and the Islet is explored long before (in the order of quest resolution) it is discarded.
