His card says...

 

Action: While Deorwine is defending, spend 1 leadship resource to cancel a shadow effect dealt to the attacking enemy. Any player may trigger this action.

 

Can you do this after the shadow card is revealed? I'm not sure as it's an action, unlike Erkenbrand which is a response and uses the phrase "just revealed".

> I believe Deorwine’s ‘Action’ should be a ‘Response’ to allow his ability to work as intended. His effect is meant to cancel the shadow effect after it is revealed and before it resolves in a similar fashion to Hasty Stroke.

That makes sense. As an action it made no sense, given previous rulings on cancellation of shadow effects via shadow card discard did not work in many cases.

 

So will this become an official errata?
