Hi,

We have some tiny news for the third packs of Vengeance of Mordor Cycle in french, it is only a name and a visual but I still want to share it with you.

The pack is named Le Défi des Gens-des-Chariots, who can be in a approximate traduction The Challenge of the Wainriders (an word to word would be People-Wagon, there are eastern people who fight on Wagon). We can see a Galadriel on an illustration :

Since there is already A Galadriel ally, and I don't expect to see Galadriel on a encounter cards I think it is most likely to be the hero, or possibly .an event of attachment related to her.

Wow! This is the most excited I have been for a pack since Radagast! So much to unpack here but dust off the doomed events and time to bring Grima back to Isenguard, maybe with Mirlonde or Smeagol to make it a mono-Lore and still keep your threat low. 

 

And his staff should help keep him fueled while making him playable for multiplayer or outside of a dedicated starting low threat lineup.

 

Great job Caleb and excited to finally have the key missing character.

Now please give us the Spirit Aragorn and answer our curiousity about the final hero. Gandalf the White or the Blue Wizards are my 1st and 2nd guesses but we shall see.
