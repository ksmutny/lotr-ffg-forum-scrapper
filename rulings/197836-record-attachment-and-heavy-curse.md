If Heavy Curse is in play, do you have to pay an extra resource if in your discard pile there is a single copy of the event you are trying to play with the Record?

 

The record specifically says to play the event as if it were in your hand. Does this mean it is not considered to be in your discard pile, and thus you pay the regular cost? Or is the "as if it were from your hand" text just there to clarify that you must pay for the event, and it doesn't mean that it is actually no longer in your discard pile?

 

Possibly relevant rulebook text:

 

>  An event card is played from a player’s hand, its text effects are resolved, and the card is then placed in its owner’s discard pile.

I find his explanation strange because it seems to not truly fit the definition of "as if it were".  I think it makes more sense to say what you said in your original post that the text was only included to clarify that its cost must still be paid. 

 

It seems it would be more appropriate for the tome to say "play (and, as a result, pay for) any event card in your discard pile".

 

Since "as if it were" does not change the physical location of where the card is being played from you can use Map of Earnil to play Elven light, right?  So you trigger Map of Earnil, place Elven Light into your hand, draw a card, then place Elven Light onto the bottom of your deck?
