Hey guys,

Can you use The Master Ring to cancel Sacked!?  I assume so because you're canceling the whole card and not directly the uncancellable When Revealed effects, kind of like when you cancel the Shadow Effect, but yea... I dunno. 

Thanks.

I was asking Caleb this week and got the following answer:

I am not surprised at all, as The Door is Closed! cancels the effects on an encounter card after it has been revealed, in which case the When revealed is active, even if only for a short time.
