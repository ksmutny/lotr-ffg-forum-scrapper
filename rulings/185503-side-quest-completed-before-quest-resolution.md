So I have Gather Information side quest in the staging area and at the beginning of the quest phase I choose it to be my active quest.

 

Then I play Quick Strike and Legolas kills something and completes the side quest. Now, does the quest switch back to the main quest? Or am I now in this situation where any progress I make this turn disappears?

I wouldn't think of my example as trying to "carry over" anything. But regardless, Caleb gave me an answer.

> The rules for side quests say that at the beginning of the quest phase you must choose which quest stage will be the current quest until the end of the phase. So, if you defeat a side quest before the resolution of the quest phase, then you cannot make progress on any other quest stage.

If you do not commit characters to quest (2nd part of your question), you will have to raise your threat by the amount of threat in staging area, because quest steps still resolve.... i think
