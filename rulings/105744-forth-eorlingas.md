I am a little confused:

Can diferent rohan heroes join their attack despite be owned by diferent players? Can all heroes of all players join their attack? Or only the 'ranged' heroes?

Got an official clarification about how this card works, shortly after it was released.  Here it is:

 

Forth Eorlingas only allows Rohan heroes to attack enemies in the staging area. Non-Rohan characters cannot participate in these attacks, but you may declare any number of Rohan heroes you control as attackers against a single enemy in the staging area. Your friends cannot commit their Rohan heroes to your attack because it's not their attack window. The Ranged keyword does not work during these attacks because the rules for Ranged only apply to enemies engaged with a player.
Hope you enjoy riding down your enemies with the new Rohan player cards!
Cheers,
Caleb
