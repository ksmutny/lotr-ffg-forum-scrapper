# [Why is there no official GenCon event for this game?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/176085-why-is-there-no-official-gencon-event-for-this-game/)

I'm not trying to be a naysayer or griper here. I just have an honest question. I see there are a couple of GenCon events for this game from a couple of highly regarded podcasting groups but there aren't any events put out by FFG. Is there a story behind this I'm missing? Does anyone know what the podcasters have planned?

There was an error made when posting this year's Gen Con event for The Lord of the Rings LCG: "Murder at the Prancing Pony" is not the correct title. The event was temporarily taken down from Gen Con's website to fix that mistake. It should be visible again later today.

The event is taking place, and it will be awesome!

I hope to see you there!

Love the username, Caleb! I'm on the wrong side of the Atlantic for GenCon, unfortunately.

 

Is there any info on when Fog on the Barrow-Downs may be released as a PoD scenario? We just recently acquired The Old Forest and have had tons of fun with it.

I'm sad to be on the wrong hemisphere of Earth for GenCon, but I hope it will be great!

Thanks for the link. The thing is that shipping to Sweden doubles the price, so I need to think quite carefully about it - I could get a whole expansion for the same price. I've been hoping that Barrow-Downs will be distributed to more local retailers like Lake-Town and Massing at Osgiliath have.

Yay! Caleb on the forums!

Welcome! Our glorious overlord!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Do we have the proper name for the gen con event??? Murder at the Prancing Pony sounds pretty silly so not surprised it is wrong/fake haha. I wonder if it will be a fellowship event for the second or third box... and will it will contain!

Well, considering that they make these scenarios months in advance, I guess the theme/location of the quest will be the same, that is, it will still take place at the Prancing Pony most probably, or at least Bree, especially if you consider they most likely already commisioned the art for it so they wouldn't just suddenly change it. So I suppose it will be more or less the same, save for the name.

and fellowship event indicates that it is a POD scenario that can be included and played in Saga mode as part of your campaign right?

I wouldn't say that.
