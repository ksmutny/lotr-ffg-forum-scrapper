> Each scenario can be fun, if you only forget about building the best deck possible. Restrict yourself!

I have been restricting myself, i don't play outlands or dwarves anymore. I'm starting to eliminate sp Glorfindel from my decks. I'm designing decks that I consider to be sub par and experimental, meaning that i have not landed on the right synergy for the deck. These decks are interesting and fun to play, but i am kind of shocked when i play a deck like this against a new scenario and it wins first try. That type of experience kind of puts a dead end to the deck building experince, since i am already using a deck that in my opinion is mediocre and still needs more tweaking.

What am i to do? Make an an even worse deck to enjoy the game. The challenge of the game then starts to become how weak of a deck can i make to beat an easy scenario, rather than how can I make a great deck to take on the challenge of a difficult scenario.

Rich's question about player accessibility may play into this cycle. I think an interview with the Caleb mentioned that they also playtest the whole cycle with just the cards from the core, delux expansion and the current cycle. So, if they are expecting a player to get victories with just those products, then a player who has three cores and everything else is probably going to feel these scenarios are easier.

My fear for the veteran players is that each deluxe expansion and the following cycle may look similar in terms of difficulty, since FFG will want to make sure they can continue to pull in new players with each new cycle, and give them some success to want to continue playing. Probably one scenario each cycle will be really big challenge, in this cycle i hope that will be Morgul Vale, although I must say HoN scenarios did deliver, but many players were outraged by the difficulty, so we might not see that again.

The challenge for veteran players is going to come with nightmare packs, which at this point I agree Glaurung that they should be made available on release of the AP, since it will ensure that new players and old will be satisfied right away.
