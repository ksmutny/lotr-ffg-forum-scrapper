Hurrah!

Maybe we're back to the good old print schedule.

I know the first quest can be metagamed, but otherwise it’s pretty obnoxious.  I had a Goblin Sniper out and couldn’t get rid of him (solo).  Eventually I basically didn’t quest for five turns in a row and kept pulling enemies from the encounter deck.  By this time I had a bunch of allies and then got hit with the location that has X threat where X is the number of characters you control.  Game over.  Was this playtested?

 

Edit:  Now having explored the quest and box more it really appears that Caleb wanted to force encourage us to use side quests.  Once you do that the threat of sniper lock is strongly mitigated.  If you don't have SQs, bring some engagement effects.

I've played all three quests now in solo and think the ratings are "about" right.  While all of the adventures are side quest friendly, JutA basically demands them.  If you don't have sides you are in for a beating.  Being able to force engagement to pull down the Goblin Snipers is also really useful.  I like the variance of the second quest and the third really gives you a lot of decision points.  Having lots and lots of threat reduction really helps on the third quest.

Player card wise the box is almost entirely centered on developing and making playable the Dale tribe.  And I'm totally good with that.  I don't think there were any Dale decks before this box and now ringsdb is littered with them.

Great job Caleb & Company.
