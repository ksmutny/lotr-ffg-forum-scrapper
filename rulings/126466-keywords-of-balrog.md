When you explore the Bridge and triggers his response, which keywords loses the Balrog?

 

1. Indestructible.

2. Cannot be optionally engaged.

3. The Balrog and shadow cards dealt to The Balrog are immune to player card effects.

4. While in the staging are, The Balrog is considered to be engaged with the first player....

 

 

Which numbers do you think?

It's just an oversight.  You get 50 victory points for defeating the Balrog.  

 

If you are really bothered by this, shoot Caleb and e-mail, otherwise let the guy get on with more important stuff.

Ever wonder if every time they get a rules question, Caleb and Matt just glance in their perfectly lucid 100-page full-resolution internal version of the rules, laugh at our ignorance, and send us an oracular answer, knowing that those full rules will never be made publicly available? Otherwise, what would keep forum chatter going during shipping delays? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
