The quest looks cool.  I'm ok with the objective locations or at the very least i'm not surprised by it.  This game has been out long enough that the designers need to be pretty creative when making quests so that they seem like a new fresh experience so some extra convolution here and there is kind of necessary.  Plus we dont know exactly how they'll function so there may still be some part of the way they work which would separate them from a normal location.

 

Not much in the way of player card spoilers.  We already knew of the side quest and had seen the image of the neutral event...now we just know what it does.  The dunedain message can be helpful, but we'll need to see the remainder of the sphere'd side quests before its full potential can be realized.  Hard to get too pumped up for a card search event besides.

 

I feel bad for whoever has to write these up and choose which cards are spoiled be it Caleb, Matt or someone else.  Give us too many player card spoilers and we lament about how terrible it will be to have to wait 6 months to use any of the stuff, dont give us enough and theres frustration that theres not enough to look forward to or discuss
