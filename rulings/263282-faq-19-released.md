# [FAQ 1.9 Released](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263282-faq-19-released/)

## 1 [Jekzer on November 15, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263282-faq-19-released/?do=findComment&comment=3080727)

https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/11/15/a-map-for-your-journeys/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/11/15/a-map-for-your-journeys/]

Let's discuss things in a separate thread.

I wanted to highlight some of the cards:

Boromir: I think he will still be played a lot. It was a logical decision to me.

Out of the Wild: the same. Trivializing the encounter deck can be fun at first (when you first see the engine working), but boring in the long term.

Háma: this one hurts. A lot.

Caldara: and this one. It means that players will need think a lot more the moment to "resurrect" her.

Let's wait what Seastan is capable to break in the future :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png].

i'm not going to be polite, nor makes friends, and i honestly don't mind, coz let's say it... FFG and designers like caleb are poison to their own games. wich is amazing by the way ! (the game i mean !) (but wich could be so much better with the right manager...)

1st :  I don't mind the BAN, please yourself if you feel like it. Maybe this time you will read what people are actually saying to you ? (coz about your game, looks like you never read our returns...)

Caleb ? Sir ? Are you playing your own game sometimes ?

Those nerfs, are just such a poor work... Escpecially for archetype that are alive for many cycles / years now... So What's the point... ?

I'm not saying boromir did'nt need a small adjustement but this... It's like if Sean Bean just died once again...

And Hama... ?  What's that for a "nerf" ? And Caldara... what's that poor rework... ?

how about reworking the "smart" way for a change ?

Fact is, lukas (star wars destiny - Thank god that one left the boat !) and caleb are the same kind of designers :   They actually might not playing their own game like they should... or listen their playtesters, like they should... ?

So Caleb... ? Who are the next ones ? Aragorn tactic ? (Wich is even better/worst to the game than Boromir ?) Nor Elrond maybe ? (coz he's healing WAY TOO MUCH don't you think ? It's not a good stuff for our game right ? You surely have to nerf those aswell !)

and how about nerfing Bilbo and Dori ? coz they're so usefull to this game right ?

So basically, you nerf Hama, for basically what... 1 card ? One combo that you don't like ? Ticket of spears... A combo that is alive for Years now.. And that no one cares about anymore... Coz people learn to play with, or without it... So basically, if you don't like ticket combo, Why don't you just bloody Nerf that Thicket like some others cards :  With a simple "add to victory display" after using... ?????

That way you kill that "annoying" combo, but you still keep Hama alive !

But no... You just make it the no brainer way... And kills an other hero...

3 Heroes are strongly nerfed (or killed here), but have you ever played any of the nightmares or very hard quest in your own game ? Don't you realize that some of those "O.P" archetypes / heroes, are needed ? Like an "Evil Necessary ?" Do you ? No... of course you don't...

Sorry to be that "hatred guy" but someday people have to stand up against too many bull ! not especially for this game, but for many of ffg games out there !

This is not a new way of making bull for you, as i remember the Nerf for "Horn of Gondor" wich has been made for like what... 2 decks "abusing" it ? **** yeah, such a great vision of making the job there aswell !

Caleb... Lukas... Same fight... Really...

And If i just want to say you thank you ! for creating this game ! Coz we all love it, A LOT !

But maybe, now, it's just the time to leave the boat and or AT LEAST, listening to the people trying to work with you ! Giving you advices on cards / quests during the creation process...

Coz nerfing just coz christmass is nice ! really ! especially with your tight vision of the game, but have you ever thought about :

BOOSTING some cards and Heroes for a change ?

Cards Like... i don't know :   Bilbo (wich cost 9 instead of 6 or 7 like he should ?) for exemple ?

Nor like DORI wich is one of the bullshitiest character ever created ?

Or even small cards like those "Rangers from the north" that we shuffle into the encounter decks wich got NO BLOODY SHADOW EFFECT ON THEM ? (would have been great you know... to have a simple "shadow effect that says :  deal 2 damage to the defending character" don't you think ?)

And the Roomcream on the cake is probably :  your amazing way of choosing your heroes :   TOM COTON !!!!???????!!!!????? Really... Really FFG ? TOM COTON... ? Is that how you want to ends up your Saga... ? With a hobbit that no bloody one cares about ? interresting ability sure... BUT How about Frodo and Sam v2 ? Or Bilbo V2 (a real playable version of bilbo ?) No ? really, you prefer a TOM COTON to end your saga story... ? Waaaaaaah... what an Amazing choice here... i can even say that this choice is probably the Designer Award Winner of the century !

God... So many award around you ffg...

Anyway... I'm probably just a raging guy right ? You all got right, those are just masterpiece works and reworks !

Keep up the good works guys... I can't wait the next changes to come in 3 years !

BTW, Nerfing a Co Op game, especially when you make it the poor and bad way... it's a piece of art in itself ! Good Job on that ! ^^

I wish that at least :  you offer something else than .pdf for those nerfed and reworked cards... Something like a Pack on Print on demand, contening all those crap your reworks for us.. That we could purchase for you to make money for your awesome job !

Take care everyone.

I'm done with ffg for a long while now.

While I'm no fan of some of the errata, I want to say that Dori is an interesting and thoroughly underrated hero, and I think Tom Cotton is a fine addition to the ranks of Hobbit heroes.  The last thing I want is for Caleb to stop designing.

I hear what you're saying Aorakis, but if you don't like these amends then just ignore them. I've never played with any of the previous changes made by the designers, and have no intention of ever doing so. In fact I've never read any of the FAQs and I've been playing since the beginning!

I don't know if your post means that you are dumping the game but that's a shame if you are. It's too good to drop.

Sooo... just to be clear... you're saying you don't like the changes!? :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

I'll be contrary and say I like the changes. Sure, buffing some poor cards would be great, but nerfing OP cards is better. I've not played with Boromir for 2 years because he's lame and boring. And while I'm a bit bummed about Hama, I realize I haven't used him for 2 years either, as the recycle effect can be so potent due to some amazing Tactics events. (However, I'm not a big NM player, so for those players, I can somewhat sympathize.)

Still, if it's that big a deal, play how you want. A tirade accomplishes nothing, and it's obvious Caleb loves the source material and wants the best for players, but they can't please everyone. Also, I say bring on chars like Tom Cotton, which is unexpected and fun. And it's a pro that he's not a pre-existing Hobbit, that way you can try him with any of the prior Hobbits.

## 6 [Aorakis on November 15, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/263282-faq-19-released/?do=findComment&comment=3081351)

Complaining about the errata and the design direction is one thing. Calling people disgusting names is another. There is no excuse for your personal insults directed at the developers. You say you don't mind if you get banned and your post gets deleted. I say, delete it yourself.


Thanks, love your work btw !


Before it dies, i bring you my best deck ever !

I passed ALL THE QUEST IN THE GAME with it ! Even nightmares and those quest from Arkham Horror LCG !

Simply to good to be not nerfed !

I have no idea if Caleb or anyone else from FFG will read this thread, but on the off-chance they do I just want to say that Aorakis is definitely not representative of the community in general. Personally, I disagree with two of the errata, and I do find them disappointing in that respect, but I still think in general that Caleb and FFG are doing a fantastic job with this game.

I wouldn't normally feel the need to make a point of this, but I wanted to present a very definite counterpoint to this unwarranted and over the top vitriol, so again, if Caleb or anyone else at FFG reads this: Ignore the haters, you're doing fine.

Wich they will ! Don't worry !

And No, they are never listening to what people might have to say to them or suggest to them even when it's asked and doing politely ! They just make whatever they want ! coz it's their game, their choice, period .

And to be a nice and gentle sheep, as you are, i edited my post 10hours ago before i posted it ! So don't worry ! i'm such a cool guy now !

I listened to my old friend Billy Zane ! He's a cool dude !

See ? i can change and make myself a better person !

So hey ! Maybe some day, ffg will make decent coresets with some decent design process during the evolving of the game (wich dont lead to heroes heads flying into the air and or FN/Phasma in some tournaments...)

You know, stuff like REAL PLAYTEST (a serious lack that is occuring in every of their cards games)

Cheers Buddy !

PS : 

And by they way, as yoda said, dark side is not stronger, blablabla... how about making positive reworks on forgotten cards, nor heroes that actually might be happy to get out of the dusty cage ?

It might make a huge difference aswell, and people might like that better than those "nerfs" wich are just reducing the pleasure especially here for the big nightmares players...

Where boosting some of our useless heroes, might just open some new windows that might be a really good breathe for the game ! But no... Apparently, it's too much work to make a bilbo to cost 6...

As FFG would say that those new heroes and cards are apparently once again, already made for that... Even when half of those are just going straight into the Dusty Cage once the pack is opened...

I like some erratas here like the ones on wingfoot and Boromir.

Acording to Caleb's reasoning, I find the errata on Hama unnecessary. Errate Thicket instead!!! "...add to the victory display", or "...remove from the game". I find Hama one of the most enjoyable heroes if the tactics sphere, you can make decks full of interesting decissions round to round.

Also, I ask the developers to rethink some cards.

Horn of Gondor: When an enemy is revealed, exhaust horn of gondor to add a resource"

Brok Ironfist!! Radagast cunning, Dori, Bilbo... and so on

Make usless cards great again!!

Funny fact :  They Think for a long time before doing those nerf...

Then they still just kills 2 heroes in the sake of ... What ? A better Meta ? (In a co op game ?) A CO - OP Game ! It's pointless... Useless... Ridiculous...

And what ? I should be thankful coz we're gonna get a Cycle 8 ? Full POO ! that's what it is...

They killed hama for Hama (coz he's waaay too strong ? really ?) and hypothetical cards that could come...

...Hmmm But... We already have those powerfull cards you know ??? (Oath of Eorl / Hour of wrath / wait no longer) ! And i never saw any hama deck Abusing those to the point where it was bad for this game !

AND LET'S BE REALISTIC... Lotr the card game is a CO OP game ! In wich players are mainly playing it, Alone, or with very good friends ! So if something is Boring, or not fun coz too good for their playstyle... They just don't play it !

There's no need to kill heroes in public place just coz 10 guys complained about combos or 2 guys made youtube vidéos where they break and destroy some quests...

That's a point Sir Caleb should work on... His game is good, just let the players have fun ! It's not a **** competitive game ! There are no competition anywhere nor tournament where players are massively meeting and fighting against your quest, getting a reward at the end of the day coz they made the best score on some quests of yours !

Just relax Grace ! fart a good one, deep breathe and let people have fun ! just let those harder quest players have some fun with boromir and caldara on those big nightmares ! there's nothing bad in that ! We are not in Star Wars Bloody Destiny ! There's no Meta except the one in your imaginary head !

And if you ever decide to errate some cards, at least don't say you took some long time to do or think about doing it...

Coz if those exemples here are those you thought a long time about... I don't want to see what you can do when it's done in a rush or without "reflexion..." Those could be so Cra... wait for it... pendary !

The only thing you manage to do here, is losing players (4 around my community) wich where big fans of the game and brought absolutely everything even those nightmare quests and FellowKits...

Sir... You own those players a minimum of consideration, and your bad works on some erratas (especially those 3 heroes) are just so poor with so poor and late thinking that it's nothing but an insult to those players that are also making you a minimum of living.

That's my last message, i'm actually selling this game on ebay too. i'm deeeeeeeply Tired about ffg horsepooing everywhere.

After Destiny wich is the worst balanced and full of erratas after only less than year game... This...

LOTR LCG was my favorite solo-coop card game, for the mechanics, the universe, the replayability... Then you just make it worst in a simple bloodbath.

Seriously Goodbye FFG...

There are plenty of games out there with much better designers that are not making useless changes where it's not even needed.

And i defenatly hope that you will, someday learn to just read what people are telling you, that would be a great start for your community. You would look like that guy that actually cares about his players and not just a 16 years old kid that saw 4 videos on youtube in wich his little baby quests that he created, are getting powned by 3 combos decks wich is not even a threat to this game or for the fun players have playing it and deceide in a puberty crisis to just make an exemple in public...

Caleb... Joffrey Lannister... Same fight... They're juste killed Sean Bean and his friends coz they can !

So... Who's Next my Grace ?

Coz now i'm just looking my heroes and i'm just waiting for the next ones to be sacrificed on the wall of the useless changes.


I'm done with this.

LIke Roger said "I'm too old for this..."

Take care readers.

And don't forget to vote for the best deck of the entire multiverse ! He needs it ! For the sake of the "Meta"

> Nerfing the "We Are Not Idle"  ('Heroes, instead of characters) the way FFG did it is too harsh.  If the concern was  too much resources generated when you exhaust dwarf characters, then perhaps a hard limit on the number of resources to be gained (say equal to number of your Dwarf heroes) could have been imposed.  So, instead of gaining resources equal to dwarf heroes you exhaust, you still gain resources equal to the number of dwarf characters exhausted, up to number of dwarf heroes you control (which is max 3).

I agree. This would have been a more agreeable 'fix', although I didn't think there was a problem in the first place.  Why now? It takes a card that has been out there for years with no apparent complaints from the community (as far as I know) and fixes a problem that didn't exist. In this case, Caleb forgets that the large population of players are not diehard serious players who want the greatest challenge (which I respect) but are those who just play to have fun. This card is fun when I play a Dwarf deck. Now, no more.

Re Hama I feel that there could have been a less heavy handed way to solve the problem.  I thought of the "exile" the event method too.  Maybe the "put the event on the bottom of the event deck" method like the scrolls/maps do would be best.  Anyway, I agree that there should have been a better way, but I know there are things I don't know.

Caldara... she was an archetype for years.  I have a hunch Caleb looked ahead and felt that she was closing of the development space.

The timing is strange to me.  Almost as if the designer(s) felt that they needed to put out SOMETHING even though ANA was sitting on their hands.  Cirith Gurat is past 10 months now.  A new record.  Yay?  I mean, it looks like we are soon to get a NON-UNIQUE Quickbeam hero, which would probably warrant errata.  Why not wait for that?  Caleb said he was going to clarify the Vilya for X cost issue... nope.

Anyway, I abused Boromir for years, but I accept that it was time to move on.  (In my defense I never used Fire or Blood... They were just gilding the lily.)

 

P.S.  Erestor To The Sea is insane.

Can't agree more with Dalestephenson, 13nrv and Yepesnopes.

To be honest, i don't have much of a problem with "we are not idle" that is still, i.m.h.o, very strong.

Then Caldara is still playable, well, not a big news you know :   but the fun around her ability, and what makes the all archetype is just dead. Period ! Serioulsy :  They could have start gently, and kill that 4 allies revive, and bring it back to three or even 2 allies (as we get more and more strong allies to revive as the game goes on it's still good, and it would have kept the fun around multiple revive active...) ! And see how it goes first... But No... Too much brainstorming i guess...

Boromir :  from the 3 it's the one i'm the least surprised and the less annoyed. I played him when i started, then i quickly change to try some other stuff more funny. I think that a native untap is still very good, but all in all... Was he that much of a problem ? just think about it for a sec.
Will we see him a lot more now ? I'm not really that sure to be honest, and was that one of that errata's goal ? To see him more played ? Probably a bit yes... If not, it's even more useless.

Hama :  From the 3, it's the one that still turn me to the Dark Side... I really don't get that hard and harsh rework... 13nrv speak about killing the fun out of a character with Caldara, well FFCalebG has just done that with Hama... They killed the only interresting aspect of him. And as DaleStephenson, i liked to toss Elven light to grab a feint, a foe, a wait no longer and stuff the like depending on my needs, wich makes Hama interresting, and not even O.P at all... The only card why caleb nerfed him for is just that Ticket... Wich is not in my opinion the strongest one in a recursive way of playing hama.

And let's be realistic :  How many hama ticket have you seen in a random event ? And then, was it really a problem of fun for the one table you played with that guy playing it ? My last Hama Spears 4 players game proves me how not "THAT GOOD" nor "OP AS ****" that combo was... There are still plenty random and "out of combat phase" attacks that occurs on many quests. And Beregond saved the table and the game much more than Hama + Spears...

So... Shall we nerf Beregond + Burning Brand aswell ?

Shall we nerf everything that works fine in this game so Sir Caleb is happy that some of his quest stays that hard and challenging ? (btw, for a player like me, i got plenty of challenging quest to lose against... specially in 2, 3 players games, and i lost many games even with a caldara and hama on the board... so once again... Where exactly was that "primal need" for changing those ?)

FFG should also understand that players like Seastan, 13nrv and Rouxxor, are not the majority of players in the game... So when ffg Caleb saw videos or topics mentionning how those players beat those quests hard with their decks, this could not just be threaten as a declaration of war or a problem of this game going badly...

As a "normal" player, i got plenty of quest that just rekt me hard without cream and killing the fun i got with some characters is not, to me, a good way to start making the game a better one...

This game is like the anti-christ of a versus game... So really... i defenatly don't get some of those very harsh reworks... I guess that Director Grace took the word "META" a bit too seriously for a co-op game... ?

And why this late... ? Ok the game is probably going on for a 8th cycle, but he will probably not last for 7 more...

And why they never did the opposite as mentionned by some players... why never "boosting up" a bad cards that sleep in the binder ? This could be so good and could open new windows...

Too much binder cards to up probably ? But you know FFG, just try to make even just 5-10 cards ! You could be surprised how positive that could be !

AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST :  PLEASE ! And believe me, a lot of player would be MORE THAN HAPPY TO PAY for a POD with all the errated cards in max copy !

Coz erratas are (not) fine, but as a "client" i think i deserve the right to have access to the game i paid for, even when you change what has been wrote on my cards, so you could offer me the chance to have THE RIGHT CARDS that i can play with in real life, instead of some homemade prints .pdf files you gave us...

Anyway, as others said, it's defenatly not like FFG was reading what we were saying here. (Nor that they care even just a bit)...

I just know that they just read what they want, the "between the lines" ways, and do what they want without looking further or looking closely or twice at what could be done Or done differntly before it's done the poor way (wich is unfortunaly what they do most of the time)

Take care.
