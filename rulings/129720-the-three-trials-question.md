On Stage 2B: Trial of Intuition it says, "Instead of placing progress tokens here, discard an equal number of cards from the top of the encounter deck." Or something like that. But what's confusing is that if you happen to discard the Key, wouldn't it just be discarded?? I don't think that was its intended purpose, but that seems like what it would do. Anyone else wonder about this?

Troll Key and Purse received errata awhile back.  The official FAQ adds language to them, instructing you to put them in the staging area if discarded.  And just for good measure, we also have official clarification that these do go into the staging area when discarded, from whatever state.  Here's the official response on that, from a bgg thread [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/843685/troll-key-and-troll-purse]:

 

"Thanks for writing! Anytime the Troll Key or Troll Purse would be discarded (whether as shadow cards or by questing successfully at stage 2) they are added to the staging area. After they are added to the staging area, you check if there is a troll enemy in play to attach them to. They were worded this way so players would have a better chance at discovering the treasure and avoid the frustration you described.

Enjoy the scenario!
