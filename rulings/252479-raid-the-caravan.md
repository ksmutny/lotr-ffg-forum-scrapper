Pretty cool looking quest. I'm really excited to finally fight actual Haradrim in this cycle.

A few years ago Caleb & Matt talked about trying to build the game out instead of up and I think they've done a pretty good job of that.  The straightforward power cards are still to be found in the first two cycles for the most part.  More recently the power comes from card interaction.

I don't think this is really a necessary clarification. Pretty much anyone who's played this game for a few years has noticed the fact that the game is supposed to be built horizontally rather than vertically. If you've played through Angmar Awakened and Dream-chaser you'll see how most cards are supposed to work in combination with others to great effect, but not so great on their own. The difference is that cards like, say, To the Sea! To the Sea! or Guardian of Arnor is that they're fantastic, while these are just boring. Now, ovbviously i haven't seen the rest of the cycle so I don't know if there's these amazing glue cards that will bring a Song or Pipe strategy to new heights, but I don't expect it to be so. If you look at these "poweful capstone" cards like Old Toby or Burst Into Song, they don't feel nearly as good as something like the ones I mentioned or stuff like Lords of the Eldar. Now, there's nothing really wrong with "fun" and "quirky" archetypes like Pipes or Songs, but you have to admit that even within this horizontal paradigm of combos and synergies, these cards feel very underpowered. Your comment strikes me as an apology for cards that direly need it because, you know, they're pretty bad.
