I was sitting down to build a deck for the first Rhovanian quest when I immediately ran into a question. What happens if I play Necklace of Girion [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Wilds-of-Rhovanion/Necklace-of-Girion.jpg] and it finds a Goblin Troop [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Wilds-of-Rhovanion/Goblin-Troop.jpg] for its guarded effect? Is there a distinction between a card being an attachment vs being attached? Granted Necklace of Girion is also an "attachment" card, but it is not being attached in a conventional way. I feel like the intent is that the necklace attaches to the goblins, but I am not sure. The word "Cannot" is always supposed to be absolute. Have I missed a clarification in the Guarded keyword player card rules?

I heard back from Caleb! His response is below:

So, not what I expected, but I think it makes total sense. That makes this card really good for certain quests that have nasty enemies that can't have player attachments like Ships, Mumak, Nazgul, Huorns etc.
