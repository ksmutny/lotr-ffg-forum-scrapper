Soon we will see who the new Dunedain is.

Haven't played Ruins, but want to.

Battle of Five Armies is on the short list for all time best quest.

Nin-In-Eilph was not hard. It was just drudgery. It was monotonous and tedious. It was probably my least favorite quest to date. I'm not sure I will ever play it again, and I love to replay stuff.

Nightmare Steward's Fear is insane. It is so hard, but in a way that draws you in.

To Catch an Orc was okay, not great.

For me, I played from day one and I basically smashed any quest I wanted, then I basically started doing crazy combo decks instead and now I prefer to play easy quests or easy mode because you can win with Dwalin decks and so forth. The harder a quest is the less variety you can play with.

Then I played Morgul Vale and it kicked my butt so hard I still cringe. I never net deck or use forums to "solve" quests. I always want to do it myself. I know other people found the quest pretty easy, but for me it was like the quest had been perfectly designed to counter my style of play, not even sure how. Like others complained about Dul Guldur, but I beat that first try and found it pretty easy. People complained about Into Ithilien, but I played it once, then built a deck to beat it, and that deck I built has like a 90% win rate against the quest (it uses the twins, which I know you like).

But Morgul Vale was still crushing me after like 30 decks and a hundred tries. It was so freaking frustrating. When I finally did beat it I found out from an official ruling that I had been cheating. I even wrote into Caleb to lobby my case and he told me he appreciated the passion but my wins were invalid. I had to go back and try again. Eventually I mastered the quest, but it took forever. Today, that is still one of my favorites. (If you are curious I was trying to win by moving damage from a bodyguard to final boss using infighting, but Caleb said the damage was still reduced to 1. The deck that finally beat it is a mono green Grima trap deck. Now with Damrod the quest is chump)

I beat Can Dum first try. I have beat it with 3 different decks since then and I don't even think it is that hard. I am not saying that to brag. I am merely suggesting that perhaps this is more a case of personal style than "bad design". The designers just happened to counter your style. Don't worry. Keep at it. After you Crack the code you may find that this quest becomes one of your favorites. (I beat it with a Hama feint recycle combo deck, never broke a sweat. I beat it with purple secrecy timely aid, good tale, sneak attack deck, Seastan runs something very similar, and I beat it with a Dain dwarf OP deck, one hit kill erebor battle master, Gimli ally is unstoppable).

Â 

To be honest, I'd count all those as wins. That you outsmarted the designers and forced them to make a new rule up to cover their oversight is not your fault at all.

You guys don't have to convince me on the rules. I think moving damage is not dealing damage just like moving resouces. I am just saying that Caleb made an official ruling against me.

I ressurected the thread called Ranger Danger where I posted the decklist that smashes into Ithilien. I guess that list is actually tweaked for Drudan Forest (which at the time I thought was the more difficult quest... oops). The more I played the deck though, the more I realized it was really a highly focused and specialized deck that only worked against a few quests like Into Ithilien, but it smashes that quest pretty hard.
