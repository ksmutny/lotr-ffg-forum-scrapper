I LOVE THIS!

 

I would have loved actual content of course, instead of spoilers about all the APs to fill the gap, but I think Caleb and Matt do too, so I wont go on that boat. (see what I did there, due to my lack of English grammaarr!) :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

 

I'm not sure if I want to be the lore-victory-display-manipulation player, but it seems cool. At least Keen as Lances is freaking powerfull.

 

But, man! This lore-sidestep is awesome! Let's play some Golf while escaping the goblins. I freaking, freaking love this! I never knew about this particular Mountain and I love to see an article from Derek or Master of Lore about it. 

 

Ent-related cards are also a good thing to hear about! I'm also pretty excited for the Ranger cards, but there wasn't really anything about them.
