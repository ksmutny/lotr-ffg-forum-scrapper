# [Bifur, Gloin 5-dwarf rule](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80495-bifur-gloin-5-dwarf-rule/)

Hey all,

If you control 4 dwarves, then play Bifur or Gloin as your 5th dwarf, can you then trigger their Response?  I'm guessing no, but the sequences of events is hard to parse.  1) Play Bifur and you now control 5 dwarves, 2) You have now played Bifur from your hand. (can trigger his Response if he has it) Bifur gains his Response text, 3) It's now too late to trigger the response (when did it expire?).

Thanks for any clarification,

GS

Hi all,

I submitted this question and got a response.  It is kind of an indirect response.  It requires interpretation.  I believe it says that you CAN count Bifur and Gloin immediately after playing them, then trigger their Response.

Here is the question I submitted:

> My question is about the ally cards Bifur and Gloin from On the Doorstep.

> If you control 4 dwarves, then play Bifur or Gloin as your 5th dwarf, can you then trigger their Response? What is the sequence of events here -- that is, I imagine that you canNOT trigger their Response in this situation, but when does their Response text become active and when does the opportunity to trigger it expire?

And the response:

Bifur and Gloin count towards the number of dwarf characters you control when triggering their Response abilities because they have to enter play before they can trigger. As soon as they enter play, you control them.

Cheers,

Caleb

In other words, at the time that the Response text becomes active, you control 5 dwarves (counting Bifur or Gloin).  Thus trigginer the Response is a legal play.  At least, that is how I am reading this ruling.  What do you think?

hmmmm I guess I was wrong then! If I'm ever in doubt of the rules I tend to go for the harder option as that generally seems to be the case most of the time. Not that I'm complaining… gloin and bifur are gonna be even handier in a Bombur deck now I know this - especially at the start of the game to accelerate your deck early
