Interestingly, only 1 hero in this pack (not counting Frodo).

Lots of thoughts:

Doesn't seem like we're getting an objective-enemy Boromir and maybe not even an objective ally Gandalf.  From the burdens spoiled, it looks like anyone in the fellowship could be corrupted by the ring.  I like this because it allows us to write our own adventures in Middle Earth, though it could lead to some interesting situations, in which Gimli tries to take the ring while Boromir stays strong. 

At the end of the Fellowship breaking quest, I think we'll have to choose Frodo and a couple of other heroes (maybe one per player) to be removed from the player's decks.  They'll sit out the next saga expansion, while the rest of the heroes will follow Aragorn's path.  In the first Two Towers expansion, you'll be allowed to add new heroes to your decks without a penalty.  Then, in Frodo and Sam's saga expansion, you'll be allowed to add Smeagol and Gollum to your fellowship (three heroes plus Frodo) and then continue play from there ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

As many predicted, it seems like we're replaying Dwarrodwelf scenarios (Redhorn and Watcher in the first scenario and Long Dark and Shadow and Flame in the second).  I'm okay with this, and I trust that Caleb and Matt will have these scenarios feeling and playing differently. 

I also am okay with fewer heroes, as long as that means we get some fellowship members as allies.  Elrond and Bilbo are good, and if I had to guess, we'll get a Boromir ally since he's not in the core set and we don't need a third hero version of him.  I hope the other hero is Galadriel, who makes sense in this box and is long overdue in this game.

Q2 can't get here fast enough!

Really curious about that Glamdring wording now, although I feel as though as it could simply just be a typo with such matter of fact wording.

 

Also, 11 hours later, I'm still completely disappointed theres only going to be 1 hero.  I truly hope the saga expansions after this do not follow this same recipe.  Even from a marketing stand point its bizarre...the saga expansions are promoted for newer players or players that are not looking for the deep involvement of the the current deluxe and cycle releases whom may only have the core set.  Releasing a product that only gives 1 additional hero keeps their pool of choices incredibly shallow besides the fact that one can conjecture that its potentially even a rip off to provide 1/4 of the gameplay options a normal saga expansion provides.

 

It hasnt even been a full day yet and I'm already desperately hoping they'll release another piece of news that this was all a big mistake....  Next time someone interviews Caleb, I would love to hear the reason behind this decision...and then tear the logic to threads through the anonymity of a message board :/

 

Also, those wishing to see the fellowship members as the allies I think may be disappointed as well.  On the description page it states that there are 4 unique allies among the player cards.  With Elrond and Bilbo already spoiled that only leaves 2 ally spots and the hero spot to fill out the remaining 5 members of the fellowship (Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Gandalf)  two of them are getting left out one way or another.
