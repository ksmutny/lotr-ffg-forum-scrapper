I haven't played for a while, but I was thinking about starting to pick up many of the sets I'm missing, BUT then I was reading the synopsis of the latest Saga set coming out, and it makes it seem that this is the last thing being released.Â 
Plus there is no new cycle shown, is this the end of the game??

Onidsen I think you should watch the video here:

In it Caleb says that MoF is the last saga box but not the end of LOTR LCG.

And in this thread:

One of the lucky people who scored a copy of Crossing tells us where we are probably going next.

I don't think we'll keep up the same pace of material as before, but I do think the game is going to keep going.
