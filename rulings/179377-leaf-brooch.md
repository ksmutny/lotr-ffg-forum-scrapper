Can you use Leaf Brooch's effect on the turn you play it if you have already played an event that matches sphere?  For example, I play Daeron's Runes and draw a Leaf Brooch, attach it to Pippin, and play another lore event.  Does that second event gain secrecy?  Leaf Brooch applies to the first event each round, but does it have a memory that spans before it enters play?

 

There was a similar question about oppressive forest [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/135410-oppressive-forest-one-card-per-round/?hl=%2Boppressive+%2Bforest] that said you can only play one card per round, and Caleb ruled that the limit applies retroactively.  So, I suspect the same is true with Leaf Brooch (i.e., it doesn't work on the second event), but I figure I'd ask because the language is different.
