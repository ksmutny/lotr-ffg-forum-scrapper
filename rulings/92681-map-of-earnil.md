After a few plays, i'm unsure if to play an event from discard pile using Map of Earnil's action need to be pay or not.

 

I am thinking that it should but want an opinio from the forum.

 

 

Map of Earnil reads:

Action: Discard Map of Earnil to play any [spirit] event card in your discard pile as if it were in your hand. Then, place that event on the bottom of your deck.

I also got an official answer for this one, and yeah you have to pay it.

 

"The Map of Earnil (and the other similar attachments) allows you to play the event card "as if it were in your hand" - that includes paying all costs. So, if you used Map of Earnil to play The Galadhrim's Greetings from your discard pile, you would still need to pay 3 spirit resources.

Cheers,
Caleb"
