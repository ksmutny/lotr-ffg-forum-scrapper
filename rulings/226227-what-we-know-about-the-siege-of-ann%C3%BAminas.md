Standard Game Mode:

-1A/3A quest deck.

-Annuminas has 20 strength.

-All Dunedain of Annuminas and 1/3 Host of Angmar are shuffled into the deck at stage 2.

-If a player is elliminated, deal 9 damage to Annuminas.

Epic Multiplayer Mode:

-Each group gets a quest deck.

-Annuminas has 50 strenght.

-Stages 2 can only be defeated at the beginning of the round and if each other stage 2 is completed.

-During stage 2, at the end of the round, each Host of Angmar in the staging area goes to the next staging area counting in reverse alphabetical order. If they cannot, they discard themselves and deal 9 damage to Annúminas.

-At stages 3 we encounter the Lieutenant of Angmar, which jumps between stages. If we kill him, everybody wins the game.

-There's a cursive note probably indicating the end of round only happens once per round to prevent the game of being impossible.

Has someone played this mode at GenCon? Where do i discard the Hosts after they damage the city?

Have asked Caleb .. there is no shared Victory Display. Each team has its own VD.
