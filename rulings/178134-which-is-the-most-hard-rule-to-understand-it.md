This post is not a critique. This post if good for players to be aware of the most hard interpretations about some rules (usually in faq).

 

Ok then, which rule is the most hard to undertand it? Which is the more hard interpretation about some rule, the most confusing one?

 

My vote for: difference between 'limit X per round/phase' and 'limit X per game'

> What makes Quick Strike different from Hands Upon the Bow? The former says "any eligible" enemy target, but I wasn't aware there was a semantic difference.

Hopefully Caleb will address this in the FAQ, but the answer is a bit tricky. Quick Strike basically allows you to trigger the "Declare attacks against enemies" step with a single character during any action window. Because the event is merely triggering a normal framework step, it can be used against enemies that are immune to player card effects. Although the wording looks similar, Hands Upon the Bow actually functions differently. It is an effect which allows an attack to be declared against an enemy in the staging area, but it grants this ability because normally characters cannot declare attacks against enemies in the staging area. Because this granted effect is beyond the basic framework step of declaring attacks, this card does not work against enemies that are immune to player card effects. This is not intuitive, but when you think about Quick Strike just being a short-circuit of an existing game mechanic whereas Hands Upon the Bow grants a special ability (staging area attack), it makes a bit more sense. The fact that this surprises people (it definitely surprised me when I asked Caleb about it originally) is why I chose it as an example of a confusing rule.
