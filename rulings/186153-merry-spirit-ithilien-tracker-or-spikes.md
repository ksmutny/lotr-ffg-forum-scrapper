Merry spirit is ready in quest phase.

 

Situation 1:

Ithlien Tracker is triggered and an enemy has just revealed..., if Merry triggers his response on this enemy, what happens? He reduces the threat enemy's printed? or there is nothing to reduce?

 

Situation 2:

Spikes is in the staging area..., and an enemy has just revealed..., if Merry triggers his response on this enemy, what happens? He reduces the threat enemy's printed? or it counts also the -2 threat effect by Spikes?

Pretty sure this is incorrect and Caleb should have chosen his words more carefully.  I believe the new ruling is saying adding the card to the staging area is a part of the process of revealing it and the card has not been fully "revealed" until it is placed in the staging area.  As a result, "after revealed" effects must wait until it has been placed in the staging area (or discarded in the case of a treachery) 

 

This is how I believe, according to the new ruling, things should happen given an immediate attack:

 

1.  Enemy initiates attack from When Revealed effect

1a. Cancellation effects like Eleanor

2.  Regular actions may be taken during open action windows during the resolution of the attack, but "after revealed" effects are still ineligible

3.  Fully resolve the attack

4.  Place enemy in staging area

5.  Enemy has been "revealed" and now "after revealed" effects may trigger

 

If he is truly saying that "After an enemy or location is revealed, it is added to the staging area." and since that is a passive effect, it comes before "after revealed" responses then say goodbye to using Ancient Mathom on explored locations because both the location and Ancient Mathom will be discarded before you can trigger it.

 

Full quote from Caleb leaves room for interpretation:

 

>  
> 
> After an enemy or location is revealed, it is added to the staging area. Since Strider’s Path triggers “After a location is revealed…” that means the location would be in the staging area when you play it. As a result, a Ship location would be immune to its effect, preventing you from targeting the Ship location with Strider’s Path.

This interpretation would be inconsistent with other things I think. Consider enemies with Peril which make an immediate attack when revealed. From the FAQ:

 

"Q: If an encounter card effect with the Peril keyword causes an enemy to make an attack against me, can my friend use his character with the Sentinel keyword to defend the attack?

A: Yes. Once the enemy attack is initiated, it should follow each step of ‘resolving enemy attacks,’ and the action windows in between each step are open to all players."

 

And from the Black Riders rulesheet:

 

"When a player reveals an encounter card with the Peril keyword, he must resolve the staging of that card on his own without conferring with the other players. The other players cannot take any actions or trigger any responses during the resolution of that card's staging."

 

If the enemy hasn't finished being revealed while the attack is happening, then Peril would still be in effect and other players would be unable to take actions including defending with Sentinel. But  the FAQ ruling clearly indicates that Peril is done at that point.

Good point.  I knew there would be something inconsistent.

 

So...what other interpretation is there other than that Caleb is saying "since adding it to the staging area is passive, it comes before "after revealed" " effects???  Because if that is what he is saying, wouldn't it also be true that Ancient Mathom would not be able to trigger?  Maybe my logic is off.

[http://sdajce.forumactif.org/t1623p15-question-un-ancien-mathom-a-amon-lhaw-timing-de-resolution-reponse-officielle).]

 

I don't think there is really any debate on the intention behind Ancient Mathom, to be honest.  The lack of consistency in rulings is what becomes frustrating as a player.  Let me provide some examples:

 

During quest resolution two things happen.  The first thing that happens is that you determine if you are successful or not.  If successful, you place progress accordingly.  We have been told there is a response window here for cards to trigger "After you quest successfully" but before you place progress (even though placing progress is passive, I might add).  Personally, I think this makes sense because the response is supposed to trigger immediately after the condition that would trigger it.

 

During the revelation process, two things happen.  The first thing that happens is that you reveal the card.  Then you place it in the staging area if applicable, or discard it if it is a treachery.  We have been told that there is NOT a response window here for cards to trigger "After you reveal a card" but before you place it in the staging area.  Personally, I think this makes little sense because the response is supposed to trigger immediately after the condition that would trigger it.

 

To me, it seems that Caleb is saying that the following is true "Passive: After you reveal a card, you place it in the staging area".  Unfortunately, we cannot be certain because he did not use those words explicitly and the rule book doesn't say that.

 

Let me provide another example.  Say you have a response that triggers "At the end of the combat phase".  Well, passively, the beginning of the refresh phase will happen next.  If we are to follow the recent ruling, we should begin the refresh phase, raise our threat, pass the player token, and ready all our characters before we can trigger that response.  This is pretty bogus, obviously.   The reason it is bogus is because passive effects that don't have the same condition as responses will come after those responses...In this case, the passive effect of the refresh phase starting does not (in rules terms) equate to the following "Passive: At the end of the combat phase, begin the refresh phase". 

 

This is why I find it so strange that we have to wait to trigger "After revealed effects" until it is placed in the staging area.  We should be triggering them immediately after they are revealed.  This should be after any When Revealed effects. 

 

The other possible interpretation of Caleb's ruling is that the card is not fully revealed until after it is placed in the staging area.  As PocketWraith pointed out, this creates inconsistencies in rulings we've received before, so this cannot be true, or older rulings need to be altered for it to work.

 

Maybe there is another possible interpretation I'm overlooking.

 

The worst part is, the ruling seems to stem from the fact that the developers simply overlooked the possible interaction between Strider's Path and ship locations.  Since it wasn't intended that you be able to use Strider's Path on ship locations, they made a hasty ruling.  If no one had asked about Strider's Path/ship locations, and I instead had asked them about Goblin Patrol, I'm sure I would have gotten the opposite answer.  Because, I'm pretty sure they didn't intend for Goblin Patrol's Forced effect to do nothing.
