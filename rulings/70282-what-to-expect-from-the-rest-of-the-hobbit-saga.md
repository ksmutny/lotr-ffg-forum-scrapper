Out of the 13 Dwarves we got three of them as heroes and four of them as allies, seven done six to go one might think. Of course we had seen some of the party before but then Bofur surprisingly, one of the least memorable of Thorin's Co., got another ally version of himself. And with his brother Bombur, and the corresponding ally card which must be among the worst cards in the entire game, there could be hope for a repeat. We might see another four heroes for each "basic" sphere, but out of the six remaining Dwarves only Balin will probably make it among those. It would only feel right to get other races included, especially we may be looking forward to Bard and Thranduil, I'd go far as calling the two sure bets for two hero slots, and I would be guessing Tactics for Bard and Leadership for Thranduil. Balin may get Lore or more likely Spirit but who then? Will it be another surprise hero like Nori and Ori - who in terms of game mechanics seem super powerful, or shall we see Gwaihir as a hero? It would then take the Tactics slot most likely. And what about some generic allies, in the first part we only got uniques, which makes sense. The second part could hold a spot or two for a Mirkwood Spearman, Swordsman or Archer. As a wish, I hope Beorn shall see a card to cooperate with him - though it is rather hard to achieve; how about "all enemies get -1 (or 2, depending on the cost) attack strength till the end of the phase"?

I play Hobbit now for 2 days already and really really impress by real good job of designers this time. And i play only solo. What about coop game???

I think coop game is even better in Hobbit. Cose many encounter card more powerful with number of players. Good really good job! Caleb is cool man!

What we will get in second Hobbit? I hope it will be Caleb again. This guy is really cool! if HON and Against the shadow will be even better quality i will eat my hat then. Good job FFG this time!
