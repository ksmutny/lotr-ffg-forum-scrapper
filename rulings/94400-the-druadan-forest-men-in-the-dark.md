Hi! 

 

I'm a french speaking player and in the frech version of the game, I have a problem understanding the text of "Men in the Dark". The english text doesn't help me, but maybe I don't understand english enough. So I ask the question : 

 

ffg_men-in-the-dark-tdf.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_men-in-the-dark-tdf.jpg]

 

Have I the choice or not ? 

 

Can I choose to deal 1 damage instead of paying 1 resource or must I pay a resource by hero and only the heroes that can't pay are dealt 1 damage ? 

 

Thanks!

I interpreted that "or" means "otherwise" (but English is not my first language).

Loosely coupled to this question was a similar thread about interpreting "if able": Caleb ruled that for "if able" you have to apply the condition in full or ignore it (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1048484/encounter-card-effects-and-if-able [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1048484/encounter-card-effects-and-if-able]). So for "Cut off" undefended, I would say that if you have only 1 ally to discard, then you do not discard it and attacking enemy gets +3 Att (despite there is no "if able").

Answer from Caleb :



> When a card says "a player must do this or this happens" that player must do the first part if able. If he cannot, then he resolves the second part. When a card says "either do this, or that" the player resolving that effect has a choice of either effect.
