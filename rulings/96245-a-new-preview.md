Look at this:

What do you think?

 

Darn, to be honest I'm really questioning the decision to make Grima a hero... But I guess it's still pretty valid. The thing is that while I get Grima wasn't always evil is because in the books ever since we meet him he's evil so it makes me think that Tolkien makes this character evil in his very nature aand thus making the idea a bit too fan-fiction-ish, but I guess if you stretch the imagination is possible. Either way thematically, he's actually a pretty good hero! Reducing the cost of pretty cheap events is great, but it's still and action and not a response, still, it's lore so he works great with Strider. 

 

Now that I think of it, you could interpret the Grima thing in a completely different way, and think it like a new "faction" in the game, like when in Meccg you could play as a fallen wizard, those were the kind of "heroes" you could use, so it kiiiinda could be comparable to that.

Yeah I love anything that expands deck building options in interesting ways and I love that Caleb (and Feonix) take such great care with the theme.

 

A+

 

Hopefully the box itself will deliver.

I also really like the decision to include Grima as a hero. He was not always evil, as Caleb mentioned in the article, otherwise Theoden never would have given him a position of power. One of the deeper themes of The Lord of the Rings, and Tolkien's legendarium in general, is the potential for power to corrupt those who hold it.

 

Just to add to Ian's point about Master of Lore, Grima's ability is particularly good because it does not say "to a minimum of 1". This means that Grima paired with two copies of Master of Lore (easy to draw with Mithrandir's Advice, Daeron's Runes, Gleowine, etc.) can allow you to play cards like Ithilien Archer or Forest Snare for absolutely no cost. Sure the threat raise is an issue over the long term but Strider has a solution for that problem. This card will be great for the metagame and I can't wait to see all of the new decks that will use it.

Wow. Grima as a hero…..i like it. Caleb make some new decisions not as a prievious Lotr card games. Cool! Cannot wait for VOI and all new NM cards. this year start very promising.

Regardless of whether or not I will play Grima, I salute the designers (Caleb and Matt) for making such a flavorful card. Everything we've seen so far from VoI is full of story and based on what they did with Black Riders, I expect this cycle to be a story focused flavor homerun. Mechanically, who knows? But the choice of Grima as hero fills me with confidence that the designers are going to shake things up a bit which I think is a good thing. It would be easy for them to keep churning out scenarios and player cards that are basically re-flavored copies of what we've already got, but it's clear they don't want to do that. I'm really excited about this cycle.

If you do not like Grima, do not use him- problem solved.

I will play him for sure, always trying to make an alternative story- that is the best thing about LOTR LCG- there are many cards and you only use those cards you want.

I hope so much we will get a scenario of guarding Isengard. If Saruman made alliance with Rohan and Gondor, Mordor would mostly attack Isengard for sure.

Aww, thank you Caleb for this new faction, it is awesome :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I personally was surprised to see Grima, but I think it is a very intriguing and thus good choice :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I really like how Caleb actually admits that he reckons not all the fans being to happy about this decision, but still decided to go through with it. I believe the game is in the right hands when it comes to flavour at least.

 

Also I do like Grima's ability very much, although I have not made my mind up concerning the Doom mechanic. It seems to bear some inherent danger of corrupting the game balance between Solo and Multi play. As has been mentioned before, in a multiplayer session it might be quite dangerous to make too much use of the doom cards, whereas in a well-built solo deck it might mean having access to overly cheap but powerful cards.

 

Even so, I am looking forward very much to this cycle and the first Deluxe Expansion to kick things off and test & experience the new mechanics :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

GrandSpleen, I think that allowing Elfhelm to counter Grima's effect would be too powerful. Especially because spirit has so many ways to get allies back into play.

 

Now that I think about it.... the wording on Elfhelm's card is very specific in that it does not pertain to player card effects. This makes me wonder if the design team had been considering doomed player cards for a long time prior to the Voice of Isengard, as far back as the mirkwood cycle. Curious, I'd like to hear something from Caleb or Matt about this.

I think that even before the doomed mechanic, Elfhelm ability could have been abused with cards like Song of Earendil and Wandering Took.

this seems doubtful, to me. seeing as how there have been 3 lead designers now (nate, lucas, caleb) and mirkwood was designed long before caleb was on board.

 

what's more likely is that the designer of Elfhelm was just very careful to be specific, as many card game designers are, to allow as much open, future design space as possible.

 

Voice of Isenguard is the first deluxe box and cycle that Caleb has been with from start to finish - even though he's done the saga boxes. these sets are in development loooong before they ever come out.

 

either way, the doomed mechanic should certainly prove interesting!
