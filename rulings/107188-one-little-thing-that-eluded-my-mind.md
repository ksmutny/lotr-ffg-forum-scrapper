I don't know why, but I was always thinking that with Light of Valinor, character still needs to be ready to commit to a quest, but now when I look at it, I see no reason why an exhausted character with Light of Valinor can't.

 

From the rules: "An exhausted card cannot exhaust again (and therefore cannot partake in any action that requires exhaustion)".

 

Just an interesting sudden realization for me.

I wasn't arguing against that, someone should point this out to Caleb then.

I was arguing that your vision of "The rules simply say that exhausting is a COST to select to quest" is only part of your interpretation. Do not impose that on other, just point it out as your opinion (like you point out the counter argument). People take a lot of time to try to demonstrate what you say is not «rules» but your interpretation, and you get back to them saying that exactly what you wanted to say. Please be more clear on this point.

 

For the exemple of  Beorn, I was talking about the same "does not exhaust to" part that he share with the noldor tactics allies and Light of Valinor.

Just received the reply:

"Hi,
A hero must be ready in order to commit to a quest. An exhausted hero with Light of Valinor attached cannot commit to the quest.
Cheers,
Caleb"

 

I wish he had gone into details a bit.

Maybe he did? He's basically saying the same thing I did. 

It doesn't surprise me that Caleb has responded to the question with the obvious answer. Maybe he doesn't understand why it isn't clear?

Hmm, are you implying, Rapier, that Caleb doesn't read the rulebook just as you don't seem to? Why do you keep pretending there is no issue if the words are written and they say what they say. If you paraphrase them to prove your point, it doesn't change anything.

So I asked Caleb and he confirmed that an exhausted hero cannot be commited to a quest:

Cards that allow a hero to perform any of these functions without exhausting merely take away the cost of exhausting, they do not sidestep the core restriction of the game. I will make a note to add this clarification to our next FAQ update.

From the rules: "An exhausted card cannot exhaust again (and therefore cannot partake in any action that requires exhaustion).

I paraphrased to try to make the above rule (already quoted in the opening post) more clear.

This rule says a card that is exhausted cannot be used to take part in two actions that require exhaustion. Questing requires exhaustion.

Light of Valinor allows you to quest and then do something else because the questing character does not exhaust as part of questing, and is therefore ready to be exhausted later.

However if you do something else first the character is already exhausted. Therefore cannot do something else as they are not ready.

As I said you would need another rule that specifically allowed an exhausted character to do something (example: ready exhausted character). Which Light of Valinor does not provide.

It's all in our perception. There is nothing in rules that forbide exhausted character from taking actions specifically. Light of Valinor can be interpreted as removal of exhaustion requirement of taking a quest action. Currently there is nothing anywhere - in the rules, in the errata, in the card text, that speaks against it. That's why Caleb is going to mark it in the upcoming errata. Your claims of OMG HOW COULD YOU THINK OF THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY WRONG are not valid.

> Your claims of OMG HOW COULD YOU THINK OF THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY WRONG are not valid.

 

This isn't something I claimed, I agree it wouldn't be valid.

 

However using an argument that rules don't specifically speak against it is assuming that the rules are inherently permissive. 

This isn't usually the case with game rules, which are by their nature written from a restrictive position (they limit the options you can take).

Caleb putting something into the errata/faq is not evidence that your interpretation was valid either, it only shows best practice. Multiple people queried something it should be officially clarified so that their isn't any doubt and future people that may make the mistake you have won't make it.

iznax and MyNeighborTrololo, you both need to be more respectful on these forums. These forums are a privilege, not a right and that privilege should probably be taken away from some people soon.

 

> Do you really expect me to have a constructive conversation with you after all this spit and bile out of your mouth? :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

Yes, I do. You don't fight fire with fire. You fight fire with water. You're not going to get someone to listen to you if you continue their obnoxiousness with your own. This applies to you too iznax.

 

--------

 

iznax, you're not seeing the point we're trying to make. Generally a sensible person would consider exhausting to be the cost of questing, attacking, and defending. The rules say:
 

>  
> 
> An exhausted card cannot exhaust again (and therefore cannot partake in any action that requires exhaustion).

 

But Light of Valinor and Beorn say that you DO NOT EXHAUST to quest/defend (we are not exhausting again, which is what this rule is talking about). Therefore the exhaust cost is removed, making questing/defending just like any Action keyword on a card that doesn't require you to exhaust. An exhausted Lore Glorfindel can use his healing ability just fine because it does not require him to exhaust. The only difference is that committing to the quest and attacking and defending happen at very specific times and don't require you to have a card to do them.

 

Caleb's reply is odd to me. He says:

 

>  
> 
> The intent of this rule is a core mechanic of the game: exhausted heroes cannot perform actions. They cannot quest, attack, or defend.

 

But exhausted heroes CAN perform actions! As long as that action does not require exhausting, which is exactly what LoV does for questing. He then says "They cannot quest, attack, or defend," which, combined with "the intent of this rule is a core mechanic of the game" makes it sound like he's saying "since we made questing/attacking/defending a core part of the game instead of being actions on the cards, we can twist the rules to say that you can't be exhausted, even if the requirement of exhausting is removed."

 

I don't know. Just seems like he's trying to make up excuses to have the ruling applied the way he thinks it should be applied. The only thing in what he said that makes me care about listening to him is the word "intent". I'm well aware that the people who write the rules can't/don't always think of everything when they write the rules down. Therefore, if he knows that the intent of the rules was that we shouldn't be able to do this if we're already exhausted, then I'm ok with it, but the rules then need to be rewritten in a way that explains:

 

"If a character is exhausted, it may not perform an action that normally requires it to exhaust, even if the requirement to exhaust has been removed by a card effect."

Alongside a very clear lay-out of action windows and how responses etc. work, I hope the next FAQ clears up just this kind of confusion. Passive effects are now clear, but the idea of costs and ignoring costs is not explicitly laid out in the rules. I'm happy to play as it's ruled, since I completely understand that the intended meaning of a phrase can be lost when written down, and thematically I like that exhausted characters can't do the main three actions, but FFG could do to clarify a few things. I don't think this is down to anything more than the designer knowing exactly what they meant, but the process of writing things down (like in a rule-book) lost some of the steps that make it clear.

 

It's not unlike writing things on a forum, and having the tone of the message get lost because it's gone from a voice in your head to words on a screen, and words on a screen don't always convey irony, sarcasm, or a general sense of humour!

>

The order of operations I listed is a logical writing out of rules in the rulebook. It's not written out as clearly as that in the rules. I was furthering my argument that Caleb has not been inconsistent. The fact that it should be clarrified to avoid confusion i completely agree with.

As for the addition of the passive effect as step 1, it could go there - but I would argue that passive effects would not be covered by an operation, rather they would be covered by a layer type effect. (The passive effect layer would be above the active layer).

You could have Check passive effects as additional steps but it would have to be written before and after every other step to reflect how they work in the game (which is why I would use a different logical layout for them).

However, even if step 1 said, you don't have to exhaust (Which would be written as ignore step 3) you would 'still'  need to do step two. 

The fact is that people are conflating two different things.

Does not exhaust - means ignore the exhausting aspect of a specific instance (defence, attack, quest)

An action requires exhaustion if that action has exhaustion as part of it's requirements.

If you do not have to exhaust that does not mean that exhaustion is not a requirement, it just means you don't have to pay that requirement when you normally would/

However to perform an action that requires exhaustion you have to not already be exhausted, hence LoV and Beorn can do their specials first and then another action but cannot do it in reverse.

The reverse version would need to be written from the other point of view: "This character can be declared as a defender even when exhausted"

This is because rules are restrictive in nature, you need a rule that allows something to occur, otherwise it can't.



 

> People seem to think that "does not exhaust" is the same as saying "the action no longer requires exhaustion" and these are not the same.
> 
>  

That's because the rulebokk doesn't make that difference either.

 

While I agree the rulebook could have been written better. I think you're asking a bit much if you want them to spell this out - I mean no one in this thread has presented an argument that these two statements are actually synonyms. They're clearly not the same.

The rulebook doesn't expressly call out a lot of differences that are in plain english - maybe it should (In a Magic the Gathering full rules style) but I also think this game isn't worth that amount of effort the way that Magic is.

Let's generalize these rules:

1. Check to see if the cost of the action can be paid.

2. Pay the cost.

3. Perform the action.

Can we agree that that's a good generalization? Now what if we remove/lower the cost? Well, then when we check to see if we can pay the cost, then we look at the new cost, not the old cost. It's just like someone mentioned earlier: If you have an ability that lowers the cost of a card by 1 (e.g. from 2 to 1), then you don't need to check to see if you have 2 resources. You only need to check to see if you have 1.

From what I've heard from Caleb, it sounds like they aren't considering the exhausting to be a cost so much as a game mechanic, which doesn't make much sense to me.

I at least, cannot accept your generalization, because it's too general. That doesn't actually model how the game works when it comes to performing actions, the system you've laid out would treat actions and paying for cards as identical, but the game isn't like that.

Therefore you need to have a more detailed model. The model for paying for a card (with resources) wouldn't have a check on the resources as a separate step , because it isn't a "state"

1) Choose a card to play

2) Check the card is allowed to be played at this time

3) Pay resources equal to the cards cost

4) Apply card effects to game state.

There's a distinction between having to check that resources exist and having to actually pay the cost. If you split them up as you wanted to do in your example then you would have effects that checked that you could pay (but then made it so you didn't have too).

However the resource payment is instantaneous in this game so they must share a step.

This is different from exhaustion.

Exhaustion is a binary state Ready/Exhausted which applies to all player cards that are in play. At any time a player card must be in one of these two states.

They are a fundamental game mechanic not a cost. To be able to perform any action in the game that leads to the card changing from Ready to Exhausted, you must begin Ready. (Instances when an Exhausted card can do ~anything~ are explicit in the rules and clearly call out cards in the Exhausted state - such as ready an exhausted card).

LoV makes no reference to exhausted cards. It says that you can perform an action without becoming exhausted. (This leaves the card in the ready state, therefore it can perform another action).

This is NOT the same as saying, this card can do something while exhausted. (A model of the wording that the game would use for this doesn't actually exist because there are no game effects of this kind yet, I propose, this card can defend while exhausted - but they may word it differently).

I could try to re-write my order of operations example as a series of  if > then statements if that would be clearer for people.

I think Caleb's answer is already clarifying the problem. "exhausted heroes cannot perform actions".

Except that's not true. When you're exhausted you can perform any action that doesn't require you to exhaust. For example, Westfold Horse-Breaker can discard himself regardless of being exhausted. Since they keep being called "actions", Questing, Attacking, and Defending should be treated just like any other actions with the exception that they can only happen at very specific points during each round.



> To my mind that isn't the case.
> 
> What would you prefer it to say to make it clearer for you?

I would like it to actually say that being ready is a requirement. The rules say:

 



> An exhausted card cannot exhaust again (and therefore cannot partake in any action that requires exhaustion).

The rules do not say "A character must be ready in order quest, attack, defend, or perform an action that requires exhaustion." I'm not exhausting again, so therefore the existing rule here doesn't apply. The word "therefore" in that quote means that it is directly referring to exhausting again and is just a clarification, not a separate rule. Even if it was a separate rule, I "do not exhaust," therefore I'm not required to exhaust.

I'm totally not against changing the rules to say this. I think it's a good idea that we should be ready despite LoV, Beorn, Galadriel, Gandalf, Naith Guide, etc telling us "do(es) not exhaust," because I think that may be a little too powerful. I just want the rules to actually say it.

By the mail, Caleb said that I mistaken a big "A" Actions from little "a" actions. Big A actions are those printed on the cards, and little a - quest, attack and defend. And those with little a require you to be ready. I know, it sounds like he just tries to cover up a rule hole he didn't know existed, but that's what he said.

Well, I hope that is not the case. Because there are actions that do not require exhausting...
