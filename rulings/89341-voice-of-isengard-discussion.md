Fantasy Flight just released some really nice preview articles as well as the new homepage for the next LotR Deluxe Expansion, the Voice of Isengard!

 

I really think the new Time component will be a blast to play with, but the Doomed player cards are going to be a knife in the ribs for me because I typically start with beefier heroes and a higher threat.  

 

And it looks like Saruman will be an ally after all.  I predict he slowly turns evil over the course of the Ring-maker cycle.  I'm particularly excited about 9 different encounter sets in this expansion, as well.  That's going to offer a lot of variety, so I'm assuming each quest is totally different.

In ''turtle" quests maybe yes, as long as you can control your threat.

Though Caleb has stated that he wanted to counter this popular tactic in VoI.

Hence the time X mechaninc; making the doomed X possibly quite high as a cost in the new quests.

 

This is all in theory of course. nothing certain.

But if so, Loreagorn will be everyone's new favorite hero.

If we do not receive news today, then Caleb and team are proven torturers. Waiting truly is agonizing at times. I feel as Pippin did in the Return of the King before the last great battle."I don't want to be in a battle, but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse."

> Surprised no one has mentioned the Threat Cost is back to being readable!  Small victories.

 

It was only thematicaly shadowed for "Against the Shadow" cycle, heh.

Now seriously: These small victories (tactics Rohan, Dunland, Ents, new mechanic, surprising hero, old threat cost color and design) make VoI very nice box, Caleb did great job with his team. I have not seen everything and I have not played it yet, but if it is half as good as it looks like, I am satisfied.

Agreed. The fact that this is the first Caleb/Feonix designed expansion/cycle and the theme of them points towards this being this game's golden period. I'm really excited to see what the story in the ring-maker will be like, and what new player cards we get.

I really hope ring-maker will bring some love for 2heroes deck. Probably yes, as we will see Secrecy.

Honestly, I can not imagine some card that gives some specific advantages to 2-heroes deck, but I am sure Caleb can make something innovative with his team.

I really like secrecy, but it is not built yet. I think (and hope) its main sphere will be spirit. Maybe some Silvan hero, that reduces your threat for playing secrecy cards... I can only dream.

The cardboard of the rings podcast [http://cardboardoftherings.com/] did a really good interview with him after he was hired by FFG (See episode 46). He talks about the process of designing the sets including the playtesting. It's fascinating stuff and definitely worth listening to. IIRC, the first set he had a hand in was Black Riders which was then follow by VoI and the Ringmaker cycle so we are only just now seeing his handywork (along with Caleb of course).  My gut feeling tells me that the game is getting a lot of TLC from Caleb and Matt and the upcoming AP cycle and saga sets will be the best yet.

Well yeah, we're hitting the prime--Eregion, Ost Edhil, Celebrimbor--finally getting deep in Arda history.

Man, these quests are awesome!

 

It took me 5 tries to beat the Fords of Isen with Matthew Newman's Rohan deck and the victory was so tense it was great!

 

Still working on capturing that bloody Orc with Glorfindel/Grima/Strider. I just finished an epic 21 turn game where I was 3 progress away from winning!

 

I'm playing pure solo and I haven't had this well-balanced of a challenge in a long time! Way to go Caleb and Matthew!

As I said in the rules thread, it IS beatable the harder way - I've done it.

 

And it's clear from the answer I got from Caleb that the "harder" ruling was intentionally designed that way - it wasn't a mistake or an oversight on their part.

yeah we've already both posted in that other thread about how we disagree, no need to get into it again dude.....

nothing you say is going to change how badly worded or ambiguous that quest card/mechanic is.

Also I haven't in any way tried to state or imply that it was a mistake or oversight, its just worded terribly and could be much much clearer.
