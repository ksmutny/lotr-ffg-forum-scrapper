i know that some things say 'printed ranged/resource icon' or something like that, but what about 'good meal'?

if you have a song card on does that count towards the sphere match?

im sure this has been addressed by cant find the clarification

thanks

i sent a rules request and it turns out its the opposite

Hi Richard,
That's a good question. Since the resource icon indicates which sphere a hero belongs to, if a hero gains an additional resource icon from a card effect, then the hero will belong to that sphere as well. That will allow you to combo cards like Good Meal with the song cards.
Cheers,
Caleb
