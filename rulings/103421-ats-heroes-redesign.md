Since some of the AtS heroes are quite odd in their design, making some hard to play even, I was wondering how you guys would redesign some of these.

Here are the ideas I was tossing over in my head:

Mirlonde:

-stats- should have 1 less attack point, making for 1 less threat. Or add that 1 point to her willpower, making her value level for lore go up instantly.

As it stands now that point is wasted, unless you use a readying effect.

-ability- should have worked for every player. I.e. my buddy got 1 lore hero? -1 start threat for you too. Would be a nice added multi-player bonus.

Pippin:

-stats- fine

-ability- ahhh Spippin...where to start? How about making it usable without the 2 other hobbits restriction. What's the point (besides theme)? Then make the ability raise your threat by 1, or maybe even free.

Or another thought, let the ability work in any phase, on any player. That way I can see him combo with many different cards. (Trap deck anyone?) this guy should get an errata...

Faramir:

-stats- too high. Let's give him Legolas stats instead, or even with 2 attack, lowering his threat more.

The way he is now just doesn't work for his intended play style. What where they thinking?

-ability- fine

Theoden:

-stats- fine

-ability- instead of boosting willpower for tactics, which is nice but meager, I think he should have boosted the willpower for all Rohan heroes instead. Then when he is ready, like Dain, he could also give a defensive boost to Rohan characters, (think defensive formations in cavalry for theme)as they don't excel in this spot.

IMO they really missed out on the opportunities in AtS heroes.

Glad Caleb is the captain of this ship now.

How would you guys redesign these?

I like Trololo's Mirlonde and Spirit Pippin redesigns.  Mirlonde is good as is, but Silvan synergy would be nice, especially since we're getting a big emphasis in the next cycle.

Faramir could have a lower starting threat, but I've used him effectively in decks (with Mirlonde).  Theoden is fine, but one less point of threat would be nice, and Caldara is awesome as is.

I think the most disappointing thing about the cycle is we didn't get any power heroes like we did in the previous two cycles (ala Glorfindel, Elrond, Dain etc).  Hirluin comes close, but I don't care for the Outlands play style. 

I too agree that I'm glad Caleb is at the helm now.  He's done a great job of creating powerful but balanced heroes.
