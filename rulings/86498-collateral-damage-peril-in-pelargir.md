I am almost positive I have already asked this question, but I can't find it. I've searched for it, but can't find anything. My question is: When do all of Collateral Damage's effects happen? More specifically, the card says this: "When Revealed: Discard 2 cards from the top of the encounter deck. Discard an additional 2 cards for each copy of Collateral Damage in the discard pile. ..."  So if I discarded another copy of Collateral Damage from the encounter deck with the initial 2 discarded cards, does that mean I have to discard 2 more for the copy just discarded? Or does the "Discard an additional 2 cards from the encounter deck for each copy of CD in the discard pile" effect happen immediately, at the same time as the initial 2 discarded cards, negating any other CDs discarded from having any effect? 

 

Haha. Sorry if that sounds really unclear. If it doesn't make sense, just tell me and I'll try to make it more comprehensible. Thanks for all your help!

The answer came in!

 

"When Revealed" effects are resolved on a sentence-by-sentence basis. When Collateral Damage is revealed, you discard the top 2 cards of your deck first. Then you discard 2 additional cards for each copy of Collateral Damage in the discard pile. Lastly you count the number of locations just discarded and raise your threat by the appropriate amount.
If a copy of Collateral Damage is discarded by the first sentence, then you would count that copy when resolving the second sentence.
Cheers,

Congrats to booored to winning the game. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]  I guess that "then" didn't have to be said when there's already a period seperating the sentences!

But why you was doubt about it? There is clean explonation on the card. You dont need to bother designers to check black is black and white is white.

Now that is excactly the "anything concrete" I was looking for.
