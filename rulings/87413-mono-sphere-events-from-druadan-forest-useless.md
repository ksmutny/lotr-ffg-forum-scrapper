I'm not sure if there was another thread about this topic or if anyone noticed it yet:

The monosphere-events from druadan forest are partially useless while playing the hobbit saga quests because of bilbo. for multiplayer they would work sometimes but as soloplayer, you are completly unable to play them. I think we will see the same problem in the upcoming sagas since there will be the "ring-sphere". Does anyone think we will see anytime an errata or something for those cards to make them more playable? We will have at least 24 quests where they wouldn't work and imo that's a bit too much.

 

What's your opinion?

Huh, I had never thought about that. My guess is that Caleb will clarify that "token heroes" do not count when playing these cards.
