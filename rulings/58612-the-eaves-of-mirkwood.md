I was playing The Hunt For Gollum with Tragictheblathering and HilariousPete last night and we had an interesting conundrum. At the time the Eaves of Mirkwood was the active location and it says this: While The Eaves of Mirkwood is the active location, encounter card effects cannot be canceled.

What we debated was whether a Shadow card is considered to be an Encounter card and therefore can't be cancelled while Eaves is Active. I haven't as yet found anything in the rules or official FAQ that would indicate either way. Does anyone know if I missed something?

My question and then Nate's response:

Q: Are shadow cards considered to be 'encounter cards' for purposes of things like The Eaves of Mirkwood?

A: "Shadow card effects" are a distinct category from "Encounter card effects." Eaves of Mirkwood does not protect Shadow effects.



Hi, I want inform you guys that this isn´t correct.

From the german community someone asked Caleb Grace:

Q: are shadow effects considered to be encounter card effects?

A: Great question. The answer is: Yes, shadow effects are card effects on encounter cards. Therefore, they are considered encounter card effects. That means while Crebain is in the staging area, you cannot cancel shadow card effects.
Cheers,
Caleb

That answer confused us because Nate French should have said it otherwise.

So someone from the german distributor of the lord of the rings lcg card game asked FFG about the conflict:

Hi Rick,

One fan told me the following was an official statement of Nate French concerning Lord of the Rings:

Q: Are shadow cards considered to be 'encounter cards' for purposes of things like The Eaves of Mirkwood?

A: "Shadow card effects" are a distinct category from "Encounter card effects." Eaves of Mirkwood does not protect Shadow effects.

Can you verify this?

I look forward to hear from you.

Kind regards
Mit freundlichen Grüßen

The Answer from FFG:

Greetings Marco,

I talked to Nate and he said that shadow effects should be considered encounter card effects.

Thanks,

Guess the designers had change of heart?

I hope this doesn't mean we need to reask all the ambiguous rule related questions all over again…

 

 

Sounds like a big mess there among designers…… ha ha ha……. They even counter each other. I would like they should be more serious about the game and rules……

 

 

 

you should love this ruling, glaurung, as it makes the game more difficult! no cancellation of anything, during any phase while these cards are active! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]  (even if your thorin deck doesn't use cancellation. haha)

 

 

Yes iove this rules for me is sound more logic. But i dont like when they start to change they minds like this. First he say Shadow effect is not encounter cards effect . Now he say yes this is encounter cards effect. Not serious.



i doubt that they aren't serious. nate has moved on, and caleb is lead designer. i think the overarching problem is, again not lack of seriousness, but lack of clarity in language. so, it makes sense that different people will read it different ways.

Exactly… The rules were just written so badly that once the original designer moved on they are open to interpretation form the new designer as they are simply not concrete enough to have meaning on their own. The entire game has been like this. Most games are so carefully planned but it is obvious that this game is just being made up as they go alone.. this is not the 1st or the last (I bet) that they completely reverse a ruling.. and it is no coincidence that the FAQ and errata list for this game is so large so quickly.

I called this at teh very start of the thread… just saying.
