Thanks to a recent COTR [http://cardboardoftherings.com]episode, I've felt very inspired to think up some ideas for new cards. If any of you are interested, I'd be glad to have some feedback and then maybe get some art and actually mock up some cards.

Let me know what you think!

Thanks for the feedback, guys! No, no Theoden yet. The lads from COTR took part in a meeting with Caleb and kind of spoiled that Theoden is on his way, so I left it alone.

Don't forget the spreadsheet is tabbed so there are other cards as well.
