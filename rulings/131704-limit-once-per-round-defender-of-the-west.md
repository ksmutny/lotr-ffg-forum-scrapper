I have a question upon the use of defender of the west:

I understand how this card works but since it moves characters within players I got confused by the limit once per round of some characters. My own thoughts are as follows, but to be sure I'm asking it in here. When Erestor passes to you in the Refresh Phase you can use him, since you didn't do it yet that round. And before he leaves you again the next round you can do it again since you didn't use him yet this new round. These 2 moments don't violate with the limit once per round. But it would make his action twice as strong in a 2 player game, since every player can still renew a card every round. The downside however is that if we add up the numbers we find Erestor gets triggered 2x a round, so therefore my question.

> Well, it's once per round... not sure why you would read it like "per player" when it is not written like this... Or I didn't understand your phrase.

The confusion is because "once per game" actually means "once per game per player".  It's unclear if "once per round" also means "once per round per player".  I figured Caleb must have commented about this a while ago, but I can't find a reference anywhere.  I'm going to shoot him an email so we can have an official answer.

And a quick response from Caleb:

 

> The “limit once per game” are the only player-specific restrictions. All other restrictions are card-specific. So the effect on Rider of Mark can only be used once per round, regardless of who triggered it.

It's unofficial, most source are mail answer from Caleb and can't really be proven... so... don't think it is possible on this forum
