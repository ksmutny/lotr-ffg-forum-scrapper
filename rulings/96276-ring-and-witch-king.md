If you kill the Witch-King, (for example, in Flight to the Ford -3rd of Black Riders expansion), he goes to discard encounter pile. During the game shuffle the encounter deck..., and in one round, you reveal to the staging area (in quest phase) With-King...

Can you use Ring on him? or Frodo can't use his hability with immune cards?

Official answer:

Frodo's ability is a player card ability, so it cannot be used to target an encounter card that is "immune to player card effects" such as The Witch-king.
The "immune to player card effects" text is active from the moment the card enters play and a card that has been revealed is in play. The Witch-king's text is not active while it is not in play, such as while it is in the encounter deck or discard pile. That means you could use Denethor's ability to move The Witch-king to the bottom of the encounter deck.
Cheers,
Caleb
