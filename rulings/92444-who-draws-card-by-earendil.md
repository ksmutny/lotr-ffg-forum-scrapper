When you play this card and you give the control to other player, who draws the card it says?

caleb's ruling (in short it is the player who gets the card, draws the card)

Hi Richard,
A card does not enter play until after its costs have been paid. Once the card enters the game in its appropriate game state, then it has entered play. For example, once you pay the cost for Song of Earendil and you have attached it to a hero, then it has entered play.
At that time, the player who controls the hero it is attached to will control the attachment. Therefore, the player who can trigger its response is the player who controls the hero it is attached to. In other words, if you play it on your friend's hero, your friend gets the card draw.
Cheers,
Caleb

 

thanks caleb

> So when a shadow effect says "discard an attachment you control," are you discarding cards from your hand?

 

Good question....

 

I've only quoted the rules, but i stand corrected with the rulling from Caleb.
