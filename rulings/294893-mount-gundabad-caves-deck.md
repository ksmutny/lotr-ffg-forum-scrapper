I sent in this rules question earlier:

"I might be totally off-base with this, but I'm going to wonder until I get it confirmed, so: In Mount Gundabad, are the Throat of the Mountain and Dagnir's Hoard actually supposed to be in the encounter deck or should they be in the Caves deck? It's just because between the interesting effects on them, victory 1, the threat being equal to quest points and the fact they're the only locations in the pack without the Deep keyword, they match up to all the same elements on the other cards which are in the Caves deck. And since I know there was at least one mistake in the rulesheet (the discrepancy on when to flip the quest cards) I wondered if this was another such."

And got this response from Caleb:

"You are absolutely right: Throat of the Mountain and Dagnir’s Hoard are supposed to be part of the Caves deck. I’m so bummed that I didn’t remember to include that in the rules! I’m sorry for the confusion. Thank you for bringing to my attention. I will include the correct rules in the next FAQ and make sure that reprints have the correct text."
