Hey all,

I do my usual update check of reddit, here, news, hall of beorn for any new player card leaks. Hall of beorn has two more player cards for the Fire in the Night pack that I didn't see anywhere else. I apologize if others have posted this and I missed it. It's roughly translated from german:

Giant Bear

Creature.   Beorning.  
Cannot have attachments. 

Action: Ready Giant Bear. At the end of the phase, if you have used this ability, shuffle Giant Bear into your deck. (Limit once per phase.) 
 

Ranger boots: 

Attach to a LORE  or Ranger character. Limit 1 per character. 

Response: After a Location is revealed from the encounter deck, exhaust Leather Boots to ready attached character.

I haven’t actually tried him yet, but I think Caleb... err... Thalion should be great in a Thurindir deck.  I’m glad Dunedain are getting bonuses besides the engaged effects.
