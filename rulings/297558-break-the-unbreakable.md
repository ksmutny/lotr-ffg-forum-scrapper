Just wanted to see if I understood this correctly. If I have a enemy in play with Indestructible, but not immune to player cards effects (there a few of those) can I actually bypass the Indestructible keyword with Revealed in Wrath, being than able to kill that enemy if it has more damage than hit points?

But you can kill thoses enemies, as long as they are not indestructible and you are able to attack them (i.e. some effect says considered to be engaged).

But we have indications from Caleb that if a location cannot leave the staging area then it cannot be explored.

Caleb said "If a location cannot leave play, then it cannot be explored", nowhere in his answer does he specify the staging area. And yet some enemies must leave play in order to win a quest, even if they cannot leave the staging area: Bolg in Battle of the Five Armies, Durin's Bane in Shadow and Flame, Thaurdir in Battle of Carn Dûm and Dagnir in Mount Gundabad.

I always felt funny about those rulings, since exploring means enough progress tokens have been placed, which is different than discarding the card in question (the latter of which, not the former, violates the "cannot leave the staging area" clause).

I had alread asked for a more clear ruling on that matter and this is the answer I got a few hours ago

So now I asked for a better clarification about "defeated", "destroyed", "indestructible", explored as opposed to discarded for those location and how exactly to deal with those quests like Carn Dum where it seems with rulings like these you are locked down in an unwinnable state. I will post the answer as soon as I get it.
