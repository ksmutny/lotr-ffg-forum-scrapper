I play in a group for LOTR so therefor I am always in a multiplayer situation. Am I correct that I have to currently control Bilbo to be able to play The Lucky Number? Burglar Baggins specifies that anyone can activate the cost from Bilbo's pool no matter who currently controls him, but The Lucky Number doesn't have that text.

Does this basically make The Lucky Number useless, or at least highly specialized, in multiplayer situations?

Oh, so it was on Burglar Baggins...

so that means lucky number doesn't work the same. You can ask Caleb if you really thinks it's a mistake.

For anyone interested, Caleb confirmed that you must currently control Bilbo to play "The Lucky Number". Â
