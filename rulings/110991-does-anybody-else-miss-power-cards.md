I had a look at my deck recently and realised 90% of it came from the first two cycles, or more specifically, from the Dwarrowdelf Cycle. Those expansions had just so many powerful cards which are still the staple of many decks today. All of the heroes were winners, and with player cards like Arwen, Sword that was broken, Imladris stargazer, Warden of Healing to name a few, the cycle was, in my opinion, one of the best.

In those days, I used to check for stories on the site incessantly, hammering the refresh button. I used to pay for expedited shipping so the adventure packs would arrive sooner. And say what you will about how spirit Glorfindel has affected the game, but I remember vividly the anticipation I felt for that pack. It's not a feeling I've felt with this game since.

Nowadays when I open a pack, there are one or two cards that are fun to try out, but more often then not they are placed in my binder and stay there. I realise there have been some great things recently for theme players, Rohan, Gondor etc, but if you don't want to base your deck around a specific trait, exciting cards have been thin on the ground. Take the Against the Shadow cycle for example, barring a few cards like Gondorian shield and Outlands, the cards were lacklustre at best and some of the heroes were borderline unusable.

Don't get me wrong I still love the game. But I miss that excitement of anticipating a new pack. In my opinion, with any game of this type where you level up or gain new powers, the trick is to give the illusion of excessive power, but in reality it fits perfectly into the game. It's a carrot on a stick thing. The other LCG I play is Star Wars. With that game there is always the illusion of cards being overpowered. You see the preview and think that it can't possibly be right, but when you play it the limitations become clear and the card more often then not fits perfectly into the meta. Due to its cooperative nature, this is something I think LOTR has shied away from for some time.

Of course there are lots of justified arguments against power cards. Limiting design choice, breaking the game etc. But could there be some arguments for them? Adding more options to the small number of power cards currently available? The anticipation of new packs and the excitement of increasing your power against the ever more devious encounter deck? I personally feel that LOTR has erred on the side of caution for too long. What do people think?

Definitely an interesting discussion. It's important to note the changes in design team between cycles and how this may affect the whole issue. In Voice of Isengard/Ring-maker, we are seeing the first entirely Caleb/Matt batch of player cards (leaving aside the Saga Expansions), and so while Dunland Trap may give us some indication of the power level we can expect, we will really have to see at the end of the cycle. I would argue that probably Black Riders, because it was designed by Caleb and the two Hobbit boxes give us a better indication of what is to come in terms of player cards than Against the Shadow.

 

Mattr0polis is right, though, in that I think some of the stuff in the Dwarrowdelf cycle, especially the Ziggy errata, has tended to make the designers more cautious as a whole.

I see that the power curve is leveling out a bit.  The core set was full of both power cards and useless fillers that will never see the light of day.  It had too much variance for a healthy long-running game.  Dwarrowdelf erred on the side of power cards, but later sets have settled into a more comfortable balance with less variance.  The only remaining problem I see is that it's very hard to ignore the old power cards which remain legal - hence the reliance on errata.  I wish it didn't happen as often, but it's sometimes the only way to maintain the long-term health of the game.  They could always go the MtG route and reboot the game every few years, eliminating entire sets from legal play and reprinting those select few that make the cut.  That would leave many of us out in the cold, needing to spend hundreds of dollars to get back into the new game.  

 

I think there's plenty of life left to this run if it continues cautiously and remains creative in its encounter design.  There are always ways to punish players who use certain cards and force new ways of deckbuilding and I see Caleb & Co. doing just that.  That gives me hope.  Worried about Steward of Gondor?  Make an encounter effect which raises the players threat every time a resource is gained.  A similar effect worked in VoI with card draw and turtling.  

 

There are always ways.
