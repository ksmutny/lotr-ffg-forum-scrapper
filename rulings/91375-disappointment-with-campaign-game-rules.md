The CG rules have finally been posted (a mere six weeks after printing) and are somewhat disappointing to someone who has been waiting for the campaign game for two years.  [i jumped into the LOTR LCG to experience the LOTR story via campaign mode, so the following critique is unlikely resonate with those who are happy just to be playing scenarios set in Middle Earth using Middle Earth characters.  For me everything up to Black Riders has been one long trailer to the main event.]  

 

A bit of praise is in order before I turn to criticism.  I am very happy with the Boons/Burdens concepts...it adds both cool new mechanics in the form of a RPG-style way to improve characters and very much improves the overall thematic experience.  I even like the idea of "life" for Frodo as corruption was such a big part of the story. (I interpret life as more ability to resist the Ring)

 

But the rules otherwise fall short in two ways:

 

The first is the strange penalty for wanting to use a new hero.  As a veteran of military campaign games I endorse the decision to incentivize playing for tomorrow's scenario by making loss of a hero permanent, but would argue that knowing that your group will never again get to use a rock star like Glorfindel or Hirluin is penalty enough. (hello Fortune or Fate) Adding a permanent threat penalty to using a new hero seems like overkill while also having the surely unintended consequence of discouraging players from using many of the beloved characters from the story.  

 

The second is that much of the suspense of a campaign game is lost if you know that there is no penalty for playing a scenario poorly as long as you don't lose a hero.  A permanent threat increase penalty for losing a scenario makes much more sense than for using a new hero.

 

Welcome others thoughts in hope that there is perhaps some nuance to the current rules that I am missing...

a further, nit-picky question: if Aragorn (Lore) has a permanent boon attached to him, and he is replaced by Aragorn (Leadership), would the permanent boon now be attached to Aragorn (Leadership)?

I can partially answer this - In response to a different question* Caleb responded in "You can exchange a hero you control for the same hero (by title) from a different sphere without penalty."  Extrapolating from the "with no penalty" I'm guessing that boons/burdens stay attached.

 

*For the curious, the question I asked was whether, when there is more than one player, could players exchange heroes without threat penalty (e.g. start with hobbits controlled by one player with the other player doing non hobbits ... and then at some mix things up a bit).  His answer: "I'm afraid the rules do not allow for the players as a group to change control of their heroes without incurring a threat penalty."
