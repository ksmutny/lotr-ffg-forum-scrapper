This is in regards to Light of Valinor and new Gandalf's ability.

Character "does not exhaust to commit to quests."

I'm wondering if this also allows us to use the character for something BEFORE the commit characters step (so they're exhausted already) and then we can still commit them to the quest…?

What are our thoughts on this?

I specifically asked FFG about this:

Rule Question:
If a hero has "Light of Valinor" attached (states "Attached hero does not exhaust to commit to a quest."), then can they commit to a quest when they are already exhausted?

Example: Glorfindal has both "Caught in a Web" and "Light of Valinor" attached to him. After exhausting in one round (for whatever reason) he does not refresh at the end of that round since he cannot pay the two resources for "Caught in a web". During the next round, will he be able to commit to a quest even though he is exhausted (provided "Light of Valinor" is still attached)?

Reply:

That's one of those questions that made me say "hmm" because I can follow your train of thought. However, the answer is no; a character cannot commit to a quest when exhausted.
Cheers,
