In Journey in the Dark, at the end of the quest phase, you remove 1 damage token from Doom, Doom, Doom per its Forced response.  Then, if there are 0 damage tokens left, you put The Balrog into play.

 

The second Forced response on Doom, Doom, Doom says that, if The Balrog is in play at the end of the quest phase, it will attack the first player.  Here's the card:

Does this mean that The Balrog will attack immediately after he comes into play (if he comes into play at the end of the quest phase)?  Or has the trigger for that second Forced response passed, having occurred when The Balrog was not yet in play, and he will make his first attack during combat phase?

 

My head says he will attack immediately, but my heart says NOOOO PLEASE STOP HITTING ME!

I'm still not convinced, but I can't think of any other card that had 2 simultaneous effects like this to compare it to.  I think the Golden Rule still trumps here, but it would be worth shooting an email to Caleb.

I went ahead and submitted the question to Caleb.  I'll let you know when I get a response.

I got a very fast reply to this!  Here's the answer:

 

Encounter card effects should always be resolved in reading order - from top to bottom. Therefore, you must resolve the first Forced effect on Doom, Doom, Doom (if able) before resolving the 2nd Forced effect. That means that the Balrog will make an attack during the quest phase that it is added to the staging area.
I hope you’re enjoying The Road Darkens!
Cheers,
Caleb
