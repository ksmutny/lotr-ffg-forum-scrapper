1. They're not unique, so they can be discarded: I guess it cheapens it if you feel it does, but those were both core set enemies, so they couldn't realistically have planned for every scenario future player cards would set up.

2. I asked Caleb since I couldn't find it anywhere in the rule book making clear definitions of the two terms, but destroying and discarding are different. Destroying only occurs when you place enough damage on an enemy to match its health. So discarding Crazes Captive would avoid the threat increase.

Thanks Chris51261.

 

Cheapens probably has the wrong connotation... could make defeating these enemies extremely easy and potentially unsatisfying... alternately if blitzing the quests or being able to use different heroes/ lower combat decks is the goal then awesome... both enemies are a discarded Rohan character away :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
