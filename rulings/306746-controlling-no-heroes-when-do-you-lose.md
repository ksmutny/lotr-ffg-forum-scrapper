So, judging from the Rules Reference, it looks like you lose the game when:

What happens if you lose all of your heroes, but for reasons other than they are killed?  

(a) What happens if you are playing the Gray Wanderer and your only hero leaves play for reasons other than death (e.g. Lost and Alone or Stinker flipping Smeagol to Gollum)?

(b) What happens if your last hero in play is killed, but you have other heroes currently (temporarily) out of play (e.g. Lost and Alone or Smeagol)?

(c) What happens if your last hero in play is killed, but you've got an ally in the discard pile from an effect that discarded but did not kill them?  (e.g. Folco Boffin or Caldera)?  Technically, all of your heroes have not been killed.  

(d) Do you not lose if your last hero is discarded from play by an effect that does not kill them (e.g. having 0 Willpower in Stage 3B of the Redhorn Gate or getting a second copy of Bitter Cold)?



Thanks.  It seems like this is potentially exploitable since undefended tacks just whiff if you don't have any heroes (barring non-damage shadow effect penalities for undefended attacks), especially since with the Grey Wanderer contract now around it seems like these sorts of situations will be much more common.  I was certainly treating my Grey Wandering attempts at Redhorn Gate as auto-losses if I got two Bitter Cold conditions attached, but now I'm not so sure...

To be fair, Gollum engages the 1st player at all times, so you can't just leave him with the player who started with Sméagol. But yes, this would overall seem to be potentially quite powerful. If others chip in ways of getting Stinker to the top of the encounter deck as quickly as possible—Lore Denethor and Firyal (possibly also MotKed!) are options, as is Risk Some Light, Shadow of the Past, et al.—a group might land the setup with plausible odds.

One issue to be solved in optimizing such a fellowship is how to get as many enemies as possible engaged with the 0-hero player, as once the 0-hero state is achieved, he can't play any cards (well, almost any) to help overcome the usual cap of 1 optional engagement/round. But such a discussion wanders from rules issues, per se, so I defer further thoughts for elsewhere.

I did send in a related query to Caleb, so we will see if/how he responds.
