Card Game Database has released a major update to its deck editor... if you haven't been using it, then it might be a good time to go check it out!
 
For those that do not know FFG bought CGDB at last GenCon and they have been slowly working on creating a modern community site with spoilers and deck builders. So there are lots of changes that are finally starting to appear. This is one of them!
 
Anyway, head over to CGDB and say hi... This site uses the same forum software (no coincidence) So the deck exports can be pasted directly into threads here!

Yeah, I brought up the issue of needing a better deckbuilder to Caleb at GenCon. He said he'd pass it on. 
cardgamedb is ok but the mobile version is garbage. That's what we really need.
