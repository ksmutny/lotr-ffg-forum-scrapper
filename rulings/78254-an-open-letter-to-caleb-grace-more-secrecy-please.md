I’d like to cast my vote in support of developing the secrecy mechanic.  I think it is an intriguing concept, but not currently viable on a consistent basis with the available cards.  In addition to more secrecy cards, we need a few external changes to help this mechanic enter prime time.  Going forward, fewer enemies under 20 engagement cost would be preferable.  Since most non-secrecy decks start out above 20 threat, all the existing enemies with engagement costs in the teens are really overkill in my opinion.  We also need more ways to reduce threat outside of the spirit sphere, so secrecy decks aren’t so dependent on it.

As far as the types of secrecy cards I’d like to see in the future, I think we need more ways to eliminate enemies in the staging area or negate their threat.  Unengaged enemies can pile up threat or overwhelm the non-secrecy players at the table.  The secrecy players need a better way to contribute to the fight, directly or indirectly. I think “Hidden Strike”, “Ranger Spikes”, “Hands Upon the Bow,” and “Great Yew Bow” are AWESOME, and I’d love to see more like that.  I’d like to see cards that allow you to evade and sneak by enemies and put them back in the encounter deck or discard pile.  This type of thing may already be in the works – I certainly hope so!

Thanks for a great game.

Are we seriously writing a letter to Caleb Grace? In that case, we should also make clear many people in the fanbase (including me) think that the current quests are absurdly difficult, especially when playing solo. We should ask him to design easier quests that can actually be beaten by new players without having to buy everything else that has been previously released apart from the core set. Also, I think it's an important point (especially for lore fans) to give locations a better and bigger role and not just make them quest "boosters" that loom in the horizon until they are explored as quickly as possible to avoid negative effects. I will post more points I deem important as they come up. I will try to contribute as much as I can if it has to do with making this game better.

The HoN quests are significantly easier solo, not more difficult (note that I'm not saying they are easy solo - just easier). And you can't please all the people, all the time. Most were screaming for harder quests and now that we have them, people want easier quests - can't have it both ways!

As for newer players, I get the critiicism, but there has to be a way to keep the long time players engaged and interested, and easier quests are probably not the way.

Also, while I understand the desire for more secrecy, I'd not expect it to return this cycle, as the cycle has already been designed (they are designed about a year out, IIRC) and Caleb didn't have a ton (if anything) to do with HoN.
