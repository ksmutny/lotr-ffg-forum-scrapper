How works none-returns with crows of core?

 

Enemies goes to discard pile or return to encounter deck?

And the official reply:

 

"If you play None Return after destroying Eastern Crows, here’s what happens:

1. Trigger the Forced effect on Eastern Crows and shuffle it into the encounter deck
2. Trigger the Response on None Return, search the encounter deck for Eastern Crows and add it to the victory display
3. Shuffle the encounter deck
In reality, if you know that you are going to add Eastern Crows to the victory display, you should not have to shuffle it into the encounter deck first and then go find it. You can just place it in the victory display and save the hassle. If you take that short cut, be sure that you still shuffle the encounter deck since that can still have an effect on the game.
Cheers,
Caleb"

 

 

Seastan's got a fun little example about the headaches of selecting the 'correct' copy of a card like Will of the West (going back to the burgle/Lonely Mountain scenario).  I guess you'll just have to put unique scuff marks on each card!

No that part was not a quote from Caleb :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Those quotation marks in my post are intentionally placed!

I played like Caleb answered before his answer. It is the better way and the most make sense.
