How works none-returns with crows of core?

 

Enemies goes to discard pile or return to encounter deck?

And the official reply:

 

"If you play None Return after destroying Eastern Crows, here’s what happens:

1. Trigger the Forced effect on Eastern Crows and shuffle it into the encounter deck
2. Trigger the Response on None Return, search the encounter deck for Eastern Crows and add it to the victory display
3. Shuffle the encounter deck
In reality, if you know that you are going to add Eastern Crows to the victory display, you should not have to shuffle it into the encounter deck first and then go find it. You can just place it in the victory display and save the hassle. If you take that short cut, be sure that you still shuffle the encounter deck since that can still have an effect on the game.
Cheers,
Caleb"

 

 

Seastan's got a fun little example about the headaches of selecting the 'correct' copy of a card like Will of the West (going back to the burgle/Lonely Mountain scenario).  I guess you'll just have to put unique scuff marks on each card!

Was this part a quote from Caleb too?

Hahah all the discussions going on today make me feel sorry for Caleb. I imagine he is looking forward to the weekend.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

No that part was not a quote from Caleb :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Those quotation marks in my post are intentionally placed!

I played like Caleb answered before his answer. It is the better way and the most make sense.

 

Now, drawing Doors-Closed for next Eastern Crows copies!!! ^^. Here is an alternative Thalin killing machine in anduin nmare ^^

Technically there is some ambiguity here which may allow your original argument to stand.  None Return doesn't specify that it interacts with out-of-play cards and the rules on an enemy being defeated states:

 

>  
> 
> Any time one of these cards has 0 hit points, it is immediately defeated. Defeated characters are placed in their owner’s discard pile, and defeated enemies are placed in the encounter discard pile.

 

Even though it says "immediately defeated" and later states what you are supposed to do with defeated enemies, it may mean that there is actually a response window in between the enemy being defeated and it actually leaving play to the discard pile.  This would allow both the effect on None Return and Eastern Crows to trigger before it actually left play so I think you could still make your argument as long as you focus on the ambiguity of when exactly a defeated enemy leaves play.

 

With that said, if we say that None Return cannot target out of play enemies (despite Caleb's ruling) but can target a defeated enemy immediately before it is placed in the discard pile, then Eastern Crows' forced effect would necessarily trigger first and cause it to go to an out-of-play state.  Thus, None Return could no longer interact with it. 

 

Now, I'm not sure if this argument would cause more problems than it solves (I haven't reviewed the impact it may have on other cards), but it seems that in this case it would make more sense.  I do agree with those that find the ruling awkward.  It really causes some issues where you cannot know if you are resolving the play legally or not.

 

Edit: Also, the terms "defeated" and "destroyed" seem to be entirely synonymous but is there actually a difference?  None Return uses destroyed and Eastern Crows uses defeated.  The rulebook alternates between the two it seems.

I agree with the last post. I think Caleb made an error with his ruling. The reason none return works should be that it's effect resolves after the enemy is defeated but before it leaves play. If that had been the ruling then other things continue to make sense in consistent fashion. His ruling just makes things confusing and lame.
