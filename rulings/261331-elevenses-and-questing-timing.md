Since characters are considered to be questing until the end of the quest phase, can I use Elevenses to ready my questing Hobbit characters after the quest resolves? In effect, allowing my Hobbits to quest successfully and then readying them afterward?

 

1) Send Hobbits on quest

2) Staging step

3) Quest resolves (success or fail)

4) Play Elevenses to ready questing Hobbit characters

5) Quest Phase ends

 

Is this correct?

I already ask this to Caleb and the answer was:



> In order to play Elevenses, you must play it immediately after the staging step resolves. You cannot wait until resolving the quest to play the card.

Thank you for that @Rouxxor [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/308704-rouxxor/] that is certainly clear. How are you able to ask Caleb rules questions directly?
