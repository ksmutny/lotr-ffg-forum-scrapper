A little late but here are some of my thoughts.

Aragorn - I think he is actually good despite some of the communities disappointment. His threat is high and his ability is exactly mirrored by Argalads, making him less exciting. But he is splashable and I love that. His traits are good too. He is in sphere for silver circlet and unexpected courage, which can make him a questing beast.

Shining Shield - love it. Fits right in my gondor valour deck. Put this and valiant sword on boromir and Imrahil. Also great for gimli and Theoden.

KotE - great in a dunedain deck. People have said the dunedain allies are too expensive; I wager this card will fix that.Â 

Rohirrim Lancer - 2 willpower for 3 cost on a non-unique? Great, but amazing with Lothiriel. Put Gamling out and do it every round.

Valiant Steed - a little pricy, not too many good targets. Gimli maybe.

Haleth - very good, 2 willpower and some card draw. If you can afford it, play it.

Woodman lore - its ok. Nothing too great.

MM journeyman - hes good. That 1 htp makes me nervous but he is easy to play.

Perilous Journey - so cool. Risky, but the effect is powerful. Love the high risk, high reward feel.

BoF - this contract looks good. I am surprised at how many people think its not that powerful. Hobbits will be best with it, followed by Dwarves. I don't think the limitations are hard to build around at all.

All in all, a good pack. Not quite what I expected for the final, but I think Caleb Grace has done a great job on this cycle/game, and I applaud his hard work.

From my memory, Caleb said in a Cardtalk episode that they were planning on doing a Rhun cycle when they were told that it would be the final cycle. So it is entirely possible that some things were already planned, but it seems unlikely to me that this ability was on another Dunadan and just stitched onto Aragorn. It just seems to generic of an ability. But who knows?
