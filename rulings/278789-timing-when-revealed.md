I am thinking of creating a custom mission, which "plays" with a moody Gandalf. That for I need some clarification. What happens if Gandalf (hero or ally) is in play and an enemy called Gandalf gets reveald? Will the when reveald effect occur before discarding that card (because there is allready an unique card called Gandalf in play)? I hope so, otherwise my mission wont work.

The boldfaced is actually something of an interesting point—while I thought the same way, I believe the CotR guys got a different ruling. (Yes, yes, the RR defines "in play" quite specifically, but nevertheless, looks like Caleb may have changed his mind.) Apparently Caleb is working on a FAQ revision, so hopefully it will be cleared up.
