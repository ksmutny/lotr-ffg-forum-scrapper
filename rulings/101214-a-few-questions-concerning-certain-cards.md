Good day.

 

There's a couple of questions I have, concerning the following:

 

1. Second Deep [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/shadow-and-flame/second-deep-saf]

 

What happens if it's the active location, but the Balrog has no damage tokens on it? Are any progress tokens put directly on the quest card or no progress tokens are put at all till I bleed the Balrog? I determined that the tokens are put on the quest card (there's already a disadvantage there, since I'm stuck with that as an active location till Balrog is dealt damage), but I may be wrong.

 

2. Escape to the Quays [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/heirs-of-numenor/escape-to-the-quays-hon]

 

Err, what I already ask in that page. I repeat it here:

 

> "When Revealed: Each player searches the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 enemy and adds it to the staging area."
> 
> Does the forced effect of the 3b side of the quest apply to the above? I believe not, since, by the time the when revealed.. effect was triggered, we were still in the 3a part of the quest. Correct?

>  

 

 

Many thanks to you.

Time counters - there's no limit to the number of time counters you can place on a card.  The Time X value just tells you how many should be placed initially.

 

For your two scenarios re: questing in To Catch an Orc:

Yes, if you quest for +7 progress and have a 6-quest point location, put all 6 tokens and clear that location, cancel the 1 progress that would go on the quest and put a time counter on it instead.

 

If you quest for 6, clear the location but do *not* put a time counter on the card.  This was clarified recently by Caleb.  You have to have progress that actually should be placed on the quest card before you are able to cancel it and put a time counter on the card.
