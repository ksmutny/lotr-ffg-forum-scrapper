I've come across a situation today in the Three Trials, and I just want to confirm that I can play this a certain way:

 

I've completed 2/3 of the stage 2s, and I am now doing the stage where the Key is attached to the guardian. I've got Boromir fully pumped up with Gondorian fire and he takes out the Guardian. The Key is freed and I attach it to a hero. Now I trigger the quest card effect and advance to stage 3A. All the guardians come back to the staging area.  Now I advance to stage 3B. All the guardians engage me.

 

Now it's still the combat phase, so I can declare attacks against them right? So I trigger Boromir 3 more times to kill them all and I breeze through the rest of the quest.

 

I don't see why I can't do this, but it feels too broken to be true.

official response:  you can attack the enemy again.  Here it is:

 

"Cool question. If you defeat an enemy in combat and an effect puts it back into play engaged with you, that enemy has no memory of being engaged with you. As far as the game is concerned, it is a brand new enemy that you have not interacted with yet. That means you can declare an attack against it.

Cheers,
