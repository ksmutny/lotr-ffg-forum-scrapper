Besides A Test of Will, which other cards help in canceling or dealing with tracheries?

I'm wary of having more straight up cancellation cards available. I think A Test of Will is too powerful, (Eleanor slightly less so, with the exhausting and revealing another card) and introducing more cards in a similar vein is likely to result in worse treacheries (that the designers just expect to be cancelled) or "This effect cannot be cancelled" appearing more often.

I would much rather have a wider array of cards designed to mitigate / nullify the effects of a treachery rather than completely cancel it. I think Caleb / Matt have said in the past they want to give players more options and ways to play rather than necessarily more powerful ones. We've seen this with Celeborn vs Dain, O Lorien vs Steward etc. I'd like them to take a similar route with treacheries.
