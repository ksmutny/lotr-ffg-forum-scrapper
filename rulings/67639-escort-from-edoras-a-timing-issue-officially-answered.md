# [Escort from Edoras - a timing issue (officially answered)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67639-escort-from-edoras-a-timing-issue-officially-answered/)

Just to refresh the memory this card reads:

"Forced: After resolving a quest to which Escort from Edoras was committed, discard Escort from Edoras from play"

Straightforward some might say. However a few nights ago I played a 2-player nightmare game in the hunt for Gollum cycle. And during the last quest phase of one of the scenarios Escort from Edoras was used for questing. Quest resolves and we put enough progress on it to finish the scenario.

Now comes the matter of timing. Because the rules state that "players immediately advance to the next stage of a quest as soon as they place a number of progress tokens equal to a greater than the number of quest points the current quest card has", these 2 effects seem to be happening close to one another (if not indeed simultaneous).

If the effects are indeed simultaneous then, according to the latest official FAQ, "the first player decides the order in which the effects resolve" and there´s no problem. However if they are not simultaneous which effect comes first?

PS: in nightmare this is an issue as to wether the player is allowed to shuffle the card back into his deck or wether it will be banished to the discard pile for the next scenario

Good questions. The quest progression isn't really a "Forced" effect because it doesn't use the term "Forced." Instead, quest progression is a passive effect that is always active and just waiting for its conditions to be met. So, in the order of resolution, passive effects take prescedence over Forced effects. The order is as follows:
1. Passive
2. Forced
3. Response
This means that the quest would resolve and the game would end before the Escort from Edoras could trigger its Forced effect.
To answer your question about Forced effects that share a trigger: yes, the first player decides the order of resolution in cases of a tie.
Hope that helps,
Caleb

Took the question to the FFG rules section and this is what I got from Caleb:

Good, good point. Really deep question about the rules. So in nightmare mode EFE will comeback to your deck. Bravo! Thanks

Thank you for sharing. That is interesting. I remember having discussed with Nate that the next FAQ would contain a more detailed and more precise turn phase table. This "Passive" effect definition might be part of it, this is an entirely new concept. Interestingly, we have in the rules the concept of "Constant effects" such as the Enchanted stream, or Thalin's ability (always wondered why that one was not a Response…). I wonder how Constant and Passive differ and if or how they intercalate.
