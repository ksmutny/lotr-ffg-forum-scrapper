When you Search X from the out-of-play deck, do the discarded cards go back into the normal discard deck or do you make a new out-of-play discard deck?  It makes a difference since I'd like to possibly recycle the cards with Will of the West.

> Is the player's out of play deck still considered to be normal player deck? Can I use Hidden Cache response when I discarding cards from out of play deck via Searches?

I got the answer from Caleb:

 

Hi Laco,

No, your out-of-play deck is not the same as your deck, so Hidden Cache cannot be triggered because its trigger condition is not met when discarded from your out-of-play deck.

I hope you’re enjoying The Voice of Isengard!

Cheers,

Caleb
