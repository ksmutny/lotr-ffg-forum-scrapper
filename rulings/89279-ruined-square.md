if you use west gates action to search for another osgilliath location, and choose the square, how does the surge work?

do you shuffle then surge, or does it not at all?

thanks

Normally you need to shuffle anyway after a search. So that would be:

 1. Search for the square in the Encounter deck and reveal it
 2. Shuffle
 3. Surge
 4. Make West gates the active location
 5. Shuffle again

It is a bit awkward. Shuffle in step 2 may be unnecessary, since you do not change the order of the cards. But this would prevent cheating (selecting the location after knowledge of the first card of the Encounter deck, which would be the surge card.)

 

You could drop an email to Caleb, he is very responsive (and kind).

thanks for the responses, i think the shuffle makes sense, as for the tower it is a little ambiguous, i shall see what caleb says

no, this was his reply

Hi Richard,
If there is no active location, then you do not have to exhaust a character to travel to Ruined Tower.
The surge keyword is only triggered when you reveal the card with surge. For this reason, some search effects say "search for an encounter card and reveal it..." If the search effect does not say to reveal the card, then you do not trigger surge.
Hope you're enjoying the scenario!
Caleb

 

however i read that west gate is different to the tower in that you have to do its action to travel....becuase it doesnt say 'if there is X, do Y to travel....' it just says 'do X to travel...'
