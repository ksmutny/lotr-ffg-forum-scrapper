Absolutely shocked that Balin is of the leadership sphere (thought he was a lock for spirit); but what a good card although. Lower starting threat, decent stats, and a pretty great ability IMO.  Almost a pity the 3 leadership dwarves are all soo good because when deckbuilding one of them is gonna have to take the axe to have access to another sphere.

Also while not directly spoiled, looking at the deck lists we can see that there are ally versions of Bifur, Dwalin, and Gloin. While this was pretty much expected, it gives us a better chance at assuming which sphere they belong too.  If I had to guess id say they remain the same color as their hero versions were…still no sight of Oin although….(maybe he's the last spirit hero?!)

As for the player cards, I like the combo between the two of them but not sure I'd make the space for it in most decks. Dwarfs have better draw power through lore with Ori and legacy of durin, but I can see King under the Mountain having space in a Leadership spirit deck where you can use will of the west to replace the cards lost from the effect.  To me! My kinsmen! Cards seems a little too situational but may be clutch for a necessary placement of Miner of the iron hills, erebor hammersmith, kili or fili, and even a well timed longbeard Orc slayer (ok so maybe this card seems better the more I think about it)

What do u guys think? Shocked as I was Balin is leadership? Who's the spirit hero? Do the player cards stink or are they sweet?

Obviously an answer to those sleeping sentry/blocking wargs, etc complaints. Thanks ffg! A good, relatively low threat leadership hero with good art. Still surprised we didn't get Thranduil as the leadership hero, but I'm happy with this. 



In the last hobbit preview where Bofur and Bard were spoiled, Caleb mentioned that all the player cards were made at the same time and then seperated into which boxes they should be in afterwards so Balin isnt necessarily a response to our complaints, but he none the less will make a huge difference especially in the shadow heavy HoN quests.

I'm as surprised as anyone we arent going to see Thranduil or Gwahir (assuming either of them arent the spirit hero which wouldnt make sense plus Oin seems like a lot for that given the decklists)  but i guess FFG's logic is that after this second hobbit box we really wont be seeing any dwarves for a very long time.  They've practically had their own cycle dedicated to them plus the two hobbit boxes, there is so much more of middle earth to explore; another trip into a mountain seems doubtful

Plus there are not too many dwarves left for them to make…I'm sure we'll see a Gimili remake at some point, Id also like to see Thror and Thrain hero cards, but after that I cant think of too many others.
