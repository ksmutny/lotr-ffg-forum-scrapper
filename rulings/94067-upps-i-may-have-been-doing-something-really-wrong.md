Till this morning, considering the Archery keyword in the game, I had thought one should never exceed the number of hit points of a character when assigning the damage. But when I was rereading the insert, there was no such thing. So I take it you can just give all, say 20, damage to an ally with a single hit point? It would have made things much, much easier.

Â 

As a side question, has it been made official if the Prowl mechanic takes place before or after "when revealed"?

Archery Official Response:

Damage from Archery keyword cannot be over-assigned to characters you control. It must be divided among characters you control until either there is no damage left to assign or no characters left to assign it to.

The damage is applied simultaneously, so you can assign damage to more than 1 Silvan Refugee because their Forced effect will not trigger until after all the damage has been assigned.

For consistency with surge, doomed and other keywords, I've been triggering prowl and underworld after the when revealed has resolved. I asked this on BGG but never got any clarity on it, so this is the way i play it.
