King Under the Mountain:

Action: Exhaust King Under the Mountain to look at the top 2 cards of your deck. Add 1 to your hand and discard the other.

 

Ered Luin Miner:

Response: After Ered Luin Miner is discarded from the top of your deck, put it into play under your control. 

 

 

Does this work if you discard the Miner and draw the other card?  I'm pretty sure the answer is yes but someone else is questioning that.

Just heard back! So the method matters more than the actual location of the card. Good to know!

 

 

From Me:

My question is related to Ered Luin Miner and when his Response triggers. Basically is the "top of your deck" referring to the method that discards him, or his specific location as the very top card of your deck? For example, when A Very Good Tale discards him, and he is the 5th card from the top of the deck, does that allow you to put him into play even though he was not the very top card of your deck? Or let's say that he is the only card in your deck and is discarded when the Throngs of Unfaithful enemy is defeated. Does his Response trigger? He is the top card of your deck but you technically discarded him from the bottom of your deck.

 

 

Caleb:

Ered Luin Miner’s ability will trigger anytime he discarded by an effect that discards cards from the top of your deck. That does allow you to put him into play in the manner you describe in your example with A Very Good Tale. The Miner’s ability does not trigger when it is discarded from the bottom of your deck, even if it is the only card in your deck.

I agree, but someone else was questioning it on the Cardgamedb site, so that's why I brought the discussion here in the first place.   I did get an answer from Caleb, and it does work as expected:

 

"If you discard Ered Luin Miner with King Under the Mountain you can trigger the Miner's effect to put it into play because you are discarding it from the top of your deck. “Looking” at the top 2 cards of your deck does not move them from the top of your deck."
