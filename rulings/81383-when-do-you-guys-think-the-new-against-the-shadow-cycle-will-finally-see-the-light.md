I've been waiting for it since its announcement, but though still listed as Q2 2013 (while initially the first three chapter packs were meant to come out in Q1) the development seems to be taking ages. The first three APs have been announced for months but they're still "in development" (like the fourth and fifth APs) except for The Steward's Fear which is "in printing" (and it's been there for much more time than usual). Most of the other LCGs cycles have already started to be released (AGOT and SW are the those I buy and both of their new cycles have seen the light already, AGOT with 3 chapter packs in less than 2 months, although some of them were announced later than those from LOTR). For what I see in the upcoming section pretty much all of the LCGs are "in motion" while LOTR is being stuck there for quite a good while…no AP was moved to a different status in the last few months…the only product that's done progresses is On the Doorstep which was released a few weeks ago…It appears this is the only LCG that suffers such heavy delays…plus in more than 6 months we've only seen 5 articles regarding the cycle (one for each AP)…I hope we'll see them soon enough but I doubt it since they're all in development except one…My Leadership Boromir is going to die of old age before he can actually take part in an adventure with his fellow Gondorians…Do any of you remeber how long did it take for The Redhorn Gate to be released after Khazad-Dum hit the shelves ?…

So…what do you guys think the problem is if there is one…?

There's a lot to respond to, I think, and I probably won't respond to everything that was said regarding my post.

First and foremost, I apologize for the tone of my post. I could tell you I hit "quote" on the wrong post (I did - I truly meant to be directly responding to someone else) but that still doesn't change the tone/tenor of my piece of writing.

I could present rationale after rationale as to why I wrote my reponse the way I did (long day, stress, late at night) but it changes nothing, in my humble opinion, at the end of the day. I came across as an asswipe, plain and simple. For that, again, I apologize.

I was trying to make a larger point about the types of conversations had about this game on BGG vs. FFG Forums vs. the various blogs about this game vs. COTR Facebook and the commenters at all of these various venues. There is no doubt in my mind that the disucssion here is consistently more critical, more negative, and less plesant than any other webpage devoted to this game.

But, in trying to make that point, I did exactly what I dislike reading. I came across as an arrogant prick.

I have plenty of annoyances with this game, to be sure. The delays don't annoy me like they do others, but certainly the unanswered/unclear rules questions do. As does the "loose" language on the cards. Amongst other things.

At the same time, I appreciate the direction Caleb Grace has taken this game. I appreciate that I get a response from FFG (read: Caleb) within less than 24 hours every. single. time. I submit a rules question (barring weekends, of course). He's pleasant. He's professional. He seems like a **** nice guy. I appreciate that. And I've taken the time to let him know that I, and my entire play group, appreciate the work he and FFG are doing for the game.

I appreciate that FFG lets us know they read the forums and try to respond, through their new series of articles, to the fanbase.

Maybe I took some of these posts too "personally." Ever since I saw that Caleb reads the various message boards and group pages devoted to this game, I started to think "How would I feel if I was this game's designer and saw people constantly ragging on the designers, saying they don't care, they don't playtest, and they are just screwing with us, etc?"

Looking back, it's somewhat silly of me to take these things personally. I didn't need to react with the tone I did. It was inappropriate and, ultimately, not helpful.

Look, I love this game. I love the community. I love the friends I've made - friends I'd never have made without this game - from across the globe. This co-op games brings people together. I feel so cheesey writing it. But in my case, it's been true.

I love introducing this game to new people at my FLGS. Everyone who plays it likes it. And they come back. In my area we've developed a weekly "LCG" group, playing all of FFG's games - and LOTR is always a staple. Sure, SW and Netrunner are hot. But everyone who talks about LOTR talks about how they just want to play a fun adventure with their buddies, trek across Middle Earth, and have a good time; it isn't always about bashing your opponent.

To me, what's so special about this game is that it's about playing with your buds. Having a good time. And being positive.

I'm disappointed that, in my previous post, I wasn't embodying the spirit of this game that I love so much.

No need to apologize, you're cool, man! Everyone has an opinion and is free to post it, and I don't think you offended anyone here. I think most of us agree that the game qualitiy did increase during the last cycle. Right now there seems to be a problem to get the right balance between game testing and publishing in short periodes. I don't mind waiting longer myself, if that improves the qualatiy and the balancing.

I don't agree that the forums are dead because "everyone" is complaining, but because of the lack of source material we get. There will be a lot more discussion once the new adventure packs are for sale and everyone is able to actually play the new heroes and cards.
