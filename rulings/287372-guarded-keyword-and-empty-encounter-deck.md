What happens if I play a player card with the guarded keyword (e.g., The Arkenstone) and the encounter deck is empty? Since the encounter deck only gets reshuffled during the quest phase, my interpretation is that I get the card for free. I will reshuffle the encounter deck because I guess it’s unfair, but what’s the correct ruling?

I have the feeling if we ask Caleb he might say that then we cannot play that card since the Guarded (X) is kinda of a cost of the card.

10 to 1 that Caleb will rule the Guardex (X) overrides the Master Ironsmith ability.

If I was forced to guess how it works I would say the same, but the Ironsmith doesn't say play or put into play.  It only says attach.

Also here is the reply about Sting  and an encounter deck with no enemies. Prepare to be pleased :

 

In most cases, when you are instructed to discard cards from the encounter deck until you discard the appropriate card, you will reshuffle and continue discarding until you find that card. If you go through the entire deck, and there is no viable target in the deck at all, then you resolve the card to the best of your ability. In the case of Sting, you would immediately take control of it.

Cheers,

Caleb
