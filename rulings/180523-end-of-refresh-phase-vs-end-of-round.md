# [End of Refresh Phase vs End of Round](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180523-end-of-refresh-phase-vs-end-of-round/)

Do effects that trigger at the end of the phase, if played during the refresh phase, occur simultaneously with end of round effects, thus allowing the player to determine the order of their resolution?

 

1. Could I use Sneak Attack + Gandalf during the refresh phase and choose to discard Gandalf at the end of the round rather than return him to my hand at the end of the phase?

 

What about when player order is a factor?

2. Could I pass Erestor hero (discard your hand at the end of the round) to another player using Desperate Alliance (Give control of a hero to another player until the end of the phase), then resolve the end of round effect of Erestor to discard that player's hand before I get him back? Who makes that choice, since Erestor is now under another player's control?

If I remember correctly, I have an answer from Caleb that say end of the round and end of the refresh phase is the same thing.

I couldn't read the French part alogos, but the quote from Caleb at the bottom is in English and doesn't mention the refresh phase-- apparently it was in answer to a question of whether Gandalf could remain in play if his text box is blanked by The Nine Abroad, which expires at the end of the round (Gandalf would have to leave play).   Did I miss something else?

 

edit: hmm, I see now by looking at your FAQ that you were asking about OHaUH Gandalf, but Caleb's answer doesn't even mention raising your threat as an option.  Maybe he answered about Core Gandalf by mistake?

> The end of the round comes after the end of the refresh phase. Everything that triggers at the end of the refresh phase triggers before the end of the round. The end of the round and the beginning of the round can be thought of like book ends to the game round and each phase therein.
