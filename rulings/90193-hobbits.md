Do you think Amon Din is a must for Hobbit decks?  I'm going to get BR and am excited to make Hobbit decks, but was wondering if you think having ATS packs 3-6 (I have 1-2) are really necessary.  If they aren't I would be happy to skip the ATS cycle packs 3-6 until I find the money to buy them.  

 

Thanks

I really want it to bring more Elvish stuff, but I am also expecting the Fellowship to appear, quite simple really: Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Boromir - even if that means third versions for half of them and second for the rest.

 
Yes I agree its a good question.
 
Personally I'd be happy to see new versions of Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Boromir though considering the interview with Caleb Grace (http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/89496-br-unboxing-with-caleb-grace/]) where he explains why there wasn't a strider in the first box i'm not sure he would in the second...
 
They could release the Core hero's of the fellowship as Allies... like the Dwarfs and I guess that any of the following are potential saga hero's too; Glorfindel, Elrond, Arwen,  Erestor, Glóin, Bilbo & Gandalf... Gwaihir would awesome.
