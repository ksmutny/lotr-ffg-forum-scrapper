Hi,

 

if I´m right (and i think so), this ally is amazing.

The Action isn`t limited to any phase...so you can use him, when you want.

In Quest-Phase and also in Combat-Phase...doesn`t sound very great?...read on.

 

If you engage an enemy after all your engaged enemies have attacked, the chosen enemy won`t attack in this phase...so this ally has 1 feint inclusive. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

If you are not the last player you also can engage an enemy from other players to "feint" their attack.

 

 

 

I don`t know, why this shouldn`t work so...do you agree to this?

> thank you for your latest answer to my questions. After playing with tactic-Aragorn and some stuff which let me engage enemies during their attacks some questions came up i hope that you can help and answer them. First .. Combat Phase .. the enemies will attack first in their "Resolving Enemy Attacks"-Step. In the rule it is described that the players could do action after each of the four steps. Is their an action window before an enemy attack which is not the same action window after Determine Combat Damage? There are 3 threads in your forum which discuss about this "potenial" action window.
