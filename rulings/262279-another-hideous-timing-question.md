Or two. I've just started on the frustrating Tower of Cirith Ungol, in Campaign mode. A couple of times I have encountered "The Ring Draws Them" - cue mass engagement, multiple forced "after engages" effects, and with Sam Gamgee in play, multiple "after engage an enemy" responses. Staged enemies: Gorbag ("after Gorbag engages you, it makes an immediate attack"), Orc of Mordor ("after Orc of Mordor engages you, exhaust a character you control") and Uruk Soldier ("after Uruk Soldier engages you, raise your threat by 2")

I've seen there is an answer basically allowing multiple uses of the bonus part of Sam's response (i.e engaging 3 enemies of higher threat allows +3 bonus). 

I know Forced trumps Response in the order, but:-

 (1)  do I treat engagements in this context 1 by 1  (i.e. engage first enemy, resolve Forced, resolve Response, go to next enemy)?

 (2)  if Gorbag is an enemy, his Forced effect is an attack. If I chose to resolve his forced effect first, opening the attack window allows actions - but what about responses? Are they still stacked pending the completion of the attack?

 (3)  with Orc of Mordor (threat 28), can I ready Sam from a previous response (if allowed), exhaust him to satisfy the the Forced effect, then ready him via his Response to engagin Orc of Mordor?

 (4)  with Uruk Soldier, if the added threat pushes my threat to 28, does that mean I can no longer use my response to engaging Orc of Mordor, even though I engaged him initially at a low enough threat level?

Basically I'm trying to work out how I can maximise Sam's self-preservation (hopefully legitimately!).

This cropped up again for me in Black Riders now I have begun the LOTR Campaign in Nightmare mode (hmm), so I checked with FFG. And GrandSpleen was spot on about sorting it all out when the attack action window opens.

For reference, the response I received (albeit to a less complicated scenario) was: 

"Response effects must be triggered at the first opportunity. Those opportunities are the action windows highlighted in our online rules reference. There are still some cases that are sort of niche, like the one you describe. In the event that an enemy has a Forced effect that causes it to attack after it engages you, the first opportunity to trigger a Response will come while resolving the attack.

When an enemy makes an attack outside of the combat phase, it still follows all the steps of enemy attacks, and there are action windows after each one. So your first opportunity to trigger Sam’s Response will be after Step 1 – Choose an Enemy. During that window you can ready Sam so that he is available to be declared as a defender in Step 2. This applies regardless of whether the enemy engages you during the encounter phase or the combat phase.

Cheers, Caleb"
