I thought i read a while back that shadow cards were considered to be revealed from the encounter deck, although i could be making this up.

The reason i ask, is that i want to know, if i could use the one ring to cancel and replace the card.

Allowed?

This is what I read that got me questioning.

Not sure if it is lends support to my question above.

Q: Are shadow effects considered to be encounter card effects?

A (Caleb Grace): Great question. The answer is: Yes, shadow effects are card effects on encounter cards. Therefore, they are considered encounter card effects. That means while Crebain (Road to Rivendell #51) is in the staging area, you cannot cancel shadow card effects.
