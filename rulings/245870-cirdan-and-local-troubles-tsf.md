I was playing The Steward's Fear tonight as I'm trying to go back through all the scenarios giving them a once over with some newer decks. It was almost like playing blind again since it has been so long.

That aside the main question is how does Cirdan work with Local trouble?

The card states every time he triggers an ability increase threat by 1 as one of the clauses.

 

Does this trigger off his Forced: effect?

 

I played it as it does which made it particularly painful but I'm not sure if forced counts as 'triggered' for the sake of Local Troubles. I know it does not trigger off the passive due to the FAQ stating: "Because passive abilities don’t have a trigger they are always active and cannot be “triggered”."

Right so update from Caleb:

The card anatomy on page 8 of the core rules describes Game Text as: “The special abilities unique to this particular card.” There is no distinction made between ‘benefits’ and ‘drawbacks’ - all of a character’s game text constitutes its ability, both good and bad. Any bold trigger (such as Action, Response, Forced) is a triggered action, so if Local Trouble is attached to Cirdan when his Forced effect triggers, you must raise your threat by 1. 
Cheers,
Caleb
 
Which makes it quite hard on Cirdan but hopefully I have enough test of wills around for when I next play it!
This also infers that if you trigger off Glorfindel's effect it also raises threat by one.

Cirdan and Glorfindel are the only heroes with a Forced, and Glorfindel's Forced is essentially optional, putting aside that he will likely never be selected by "Attach this card to the hero with the highest threat cost without a copy".

So yep, sucks to be Cirdan.

Meanwhile, I was disappointed that Caleb focused on the ability/drawback aspect in answering, rather than the question of who/what is triggering the triggered ability - which seemed to me to be the only real source of ambiguity. Still, at least he picked the right answer. :)
