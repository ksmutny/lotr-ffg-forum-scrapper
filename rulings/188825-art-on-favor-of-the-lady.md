Just curious,  is this meant to depict Eowyn or Galadriel?  I had always assumed it was Galadriel, but I was reading Return of the King and there is a scene in the second chapter where Eowyn is saying goodbye to Aragorn, she drinks from a cup and he drinks as well.  It reminded me of this card.   And then I couldn't decide whether it's Eowyn or Galadriel.   What do you guys think?  Are those elf-ears?

The Fellowship drink from a cup when they leave Lothlórien as well, so I guess that's where it comes from. Also the reason Galadriel's Handmaiden is holding a cup - Caleb talks about this in Team Covenant's "Celebrimbor's Secret" unboxing.

 

And the art is fantastic. I do wish the card was more playable. I never use it as it pales in comparison to Eowyn's ability, Protector of Lorien or even Star Brooch though it's more restricted.
