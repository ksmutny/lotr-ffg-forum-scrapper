Yes, I know, promoting monosphering and stuff, but...

 

As we recently found out, they will try to reinforce Silvan elves in this new cycle. And I don't think it was a spontainous decision, yet they give one of two existing Silvan heroes ability that has nothing to do with Silvan trait at all. More of it, other Silvan elf is tactics hero, and an upcoming one is of the leadership, meaning that her usefulness in the Silvan hero deck is -1 starting threat. 

 

My question is... WHY? Why on earth her text is not: "Each hero you control with a Silvan trait or a printed Lore resource icon gets -1 threat cost."?

given that this card was designed by a different designer (lucas)  than that who is designing the silvan trait (caleb) - it's too be expected.

 

you have to remember these cards are designed/play tested a good year or more before they are released. it's not like it was designed knowing what the silvan synergy would be (especially since lead designers changed in the process!).
