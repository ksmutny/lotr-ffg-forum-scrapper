I wondered what would happen when you have to attach your hero (that got into your deck by Lost and Alone) to a Nameless.

By the classic Rulebook we found that Hero's don't have a cost. So my first question is, should we count 0 for the Hero's cost or the Threat cost.

My second question: whenever you defeat a Nameless with a Hero attached, is your hero considered death? Might be important for your score. (Kind of Cruel you need to kill your own Heroes ^^)

Yes to both.

The rules becomes fuzzy there if you try to look for more complicated situation, but those two, we have confirmation from Caleb.
