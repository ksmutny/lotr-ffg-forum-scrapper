I just landed, but Ian confirmed this from Caleb himself. This means that only Trouble in Tharbad and the Barrow Downs GenCon deck are available here. Queue sad trombone sound...

Did he get an expected date from Caleb?

They will most likely announce the next Cycle at the In-Flight report tomorrow. My guess is The Road Darkens is 2-4 weeks out, but I will ask Caleb when I see him

Dan, I thought the old forest would be the gencon scenario?

Barrow-downs was going to be the fellowship event right?

Or am I totally misinformed?

Also, it's a shame the road darkens will not be available there.

I was really looking forward to knowing the content of the box.

Anyway, go and have a blast guys!
