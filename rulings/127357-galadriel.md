Sorry if this has been covered before. I couldn't find much on it.

 

I got Celebrimbor's Secret yesterday, put a whole lot of elf goodyness and some ents into my lore/spirit deck and tried it this afternoon.

 

Galadriel is great, no doubt. I ran her with Elrond and spirit Glorfindel. I beat PtM with ease, though that's hardly an accomplishment for a seasoned player and I'll put the deck to the test with more difficult scenarios when I have the time. (Questing was so good and my threat so constant I never even had to engage the Beastmaster or Ufthak, but just quested over their heads.)

 

Galadriel cannot quest, attack or defend, but am I right in assuming she can be assigned damage from undefended attacks?

 

I'm thinking of pairing this deck with Celeborn/Elladan/Elrohir for maximum elven mayhem.

In FAQ clearly say: all effect what happen in setup with words until the end if the phase last until the end of the setup, until the end of round last until the end of the first round. So objective allies Faramir put into plai during setup and that mean they are come in to play and Galadriel passive ability start to work and according to rules that last until the end of the round. Logic?

Here is gup in the rule so please Caleb bless us! !

it's just nitpicky language

 

Objective allies are put into play during setup, which is before the first round technically starts.  Galadriel's effect may not trigger since Setup is not part of any "round."  

 

Then, can we consider them to have "entered play" during the first round of the game?
 

Well, we'll see what Caleb says!

I never saw an official answer to this question so I asked myself.  Got a response back today:

 

"Effects triggered during Setup resolve as normal. When you trigger an effect during Setup that lasts “until the end of the round” it will last until the end of the first round. If you trigger an effect that lasts until “the end of the phase” during Setup, it will last until the end of the first resource phase. 

Galadriel’s ability does apply to objective-allies that enter play during Setup (as long as they are not immune to player card effects).
Cheers,
Caleb"

 

So, while Galadriel is in play, objective allies under your control will not exhaust to quest during the first round.  And "Setup" is technically considered part of the first "round" for the purpose of resolving card effects.
