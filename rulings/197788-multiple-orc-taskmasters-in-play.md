If there are 2 Orc Taskmasters in play, and I deal damage to a Goblin enemy with 2 resources on it, can I remove both resources?

 

One argument would be that when the damage is dealt both Forced effects trigger simultaneously. Then I resolve each of them. Since the effect uses the word "and", it does not matter that I cannot fully resolve the effect the second time, I just resolve it as much as possible by removing a second resource token.

 

Another argument would be that after the effect resolves the first time, the damage is cancelled and there is no longer a trigger for the second effect.

From Caleb:

 

> You can only remove 1 resource from the Goblin in question. Both Forced effects trigger at the same time, but you must fully resolve one before attempting to resolve the other. After the first one resolves, the enemy can no longer take damage, so you cannot remove 1 resource to cancel damage since it is no longer taking damage.

 

Still doesn't sit well with me but there it is.

I'm with you, because wording is not "remove 1 resource from that enemy to cancel all damage just dealt to it."

But the intention of the taskmasters ability is that the resources should work as a shield so in your interpretation two taskmasters would weaken the Goblins instead of giving them a good shield.
