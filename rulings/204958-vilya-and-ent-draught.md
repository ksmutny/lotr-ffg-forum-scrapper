Can Viya immediately put into play Ent Draught if I do not control at least 1 Ent character? Ent Draught says I need an Ent to play the card, not to put it into play.

 

What about Well Equipped?

Is the Dwarf character an eligible target for Ent Draught if I do not control an Ent? Well-Equipped says nothing about playing the discarded card.

 

Thoughts?

There is enough uncertainty in this thread that I think it's worth asking Caleb.  I'll let you all know when I hear something.

I just sent an email myself, I hope he doesn't mind.

1. Can Vilya be used to play an event, like Galadhrim's Greeting, if you do not have access to the spirit sphere (I know a match is required for 0 cost cards, but Vilya says "no cost" so I'm wondering if that is a key difference)?
 
2. Does Vilya ignore the "additional costs" of cards like Skyward Volley?
 
3. Does Vilya ignore payment restrictions of cards like Thicket of Spears?
 
4. Does Vilya ignore requirements to be able to play a card like Ent Draught (since you can "put into play" the card instead of "playing" it)?
 
5. Does Vilya ignore costs on cards that have a built-in cost in the form "cost to effect" phrase like Quick Strike? If so, how does Quick Strike work if you have not exhausted a character?
 
 
 

> 1. Yes. There is actually an FAQ enter for Vilya in the Q&A section that basically says playing a card at “no cost” does not require a resource match.
> 
> 2. Yes. “At no cost” encompasses the additional cost because it is described as a “cost."
> 3. Yes. Since you are playing Thicket of Spears at no cost, there is no need to pay for it, and therefore no need to spend resources from 3 different heroes’ pools.
> 4. Yes. The play restriction on Ent Draught is irrelevant because you are putting it into play, not playing it.
> 5. No. Vilya allows you to ignore resource match and printed cost with its ability (and anything that is described as “an additional cost”), but it does not allow you to trigger effects without paying their ‘cost’ because these ‘costs’ are not what Vilya refers to. The term ‘cost’ as used in the expression “cost to effect” is not a formal cost, like the kind that Vilya can ignore; they are an informal ‘cost.’ We only call them costs to help players understand that you must do whatever that thing is in order to receive the benefit of the effect. You can think of the difference between ‘costs’ here like big “C” costs and little ‘c’ costs, similar to big ‘A’ Actions and little ‘a’ actions in the game. 
> I hope that helps.
