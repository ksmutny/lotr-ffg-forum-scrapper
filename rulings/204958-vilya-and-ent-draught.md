Can Viya immediately put into play Ent Draught if I do not control at least 1 Ent character? Ent Draught says I need an Ent to play the card, not to put it into play.

 

What about Well Equipped?

Is the Dwarf character an eligible target for Ent Draught if I do not control an Ent? Well-Equipped says nothing about playing the discarded card.

 

Thoughts?

There is enough uncertainty in this thread that I think it's worth asking Caleb.  I'll let you all know when I hear something.

I just sent an email myself, I hope he doesn't mind.

1. Can Vilya be used to play an event, like Galadhrim's Greeting, if you do not have access to the spirit sphere (I know a match is required for 0 cost cards, but Vilya says "no cost" so I'm wondering if that is a key difference)?
 
2. Does Vilya ignore the "additional costs" of cards like Skyward Volley?
 
3. Does Vilya ignore payment restrictions of cards like Thicket of Spears?
 
4. Does Vilya ignore requirements to be able to play a card like Ent Draught (since you can "put into play" the card instead of "playing" it)?
 
5. Does Vilya ignore costs on cards that have a built-in cost in the form "cost to effect" phrase like Quick Strike? If so, how does Quick Strike work if you have not exhausted a character?
 
 
 

> 1. Yes. There is actually an FAQ enter for Vilya in the Q&A section that basically says playing a card at “no cost” does not require a resource match.
> 
> 2. Yes. “At no cost” encompasses the additional cost because it is described as a “cost."
> 3. Yes. Since you are playing Thicket of Spears at no cost, there is no need to pay for it, and therefore no need to spend resources from 3 different heroes’ pools.
> 4. Yes. The play restriction on Ent Draught is irrelevant because you are putting it into play, not playing it.
> 5. No. Vilya allows you to ignore resource match and printed cost with its ability (and anything that is described as “an additional cost”), but it does not allow you to trigger effects without paying their ‘cost’ because these ‘costs’ are not what Vilya refers to. The term ‘cost’ as used in the expression “cost to effect” is not a formal cost, like the kind that Vilya can ignore; they are an informal ‘cost.’ We only call them costs to help players understand that you must do whatever that thing is in order to receive the benefit of the effect. You can think of the difference between ‘costs’ here like big “C” costs and little ‘c’ costs, similar to big ‘A’ Actions and little ‘a’ actions in the game. 
> I hope that helps.

I got a similar response from Caleb, although I also asked about events like Strength of Arms and Ranger Summons if you don't meet the requirements.  Since Vilya counts as playing those events (you aren't putting them into play), you still need to meet the requirements.  It only lets you cheat into play attachments and allies (if there are any) because you are putting them into play.

Wow so I was actually right and it eliminates ALL COSTS including "additional" ones on top of resource cost. 

See I knew the card text indicated that was the case.

This makes perfect sense to me because Strength of Arms requires you to have all leadership heroes to play the card and does not mention cost in any way. Because something like Thicket of Spears specifically refers to the fact you have to pay the cost with all tactics resources Vilya gets around it but whether you are playing Strength of Arms for free or for 2 resources you still need each of your heroes to have a printed leadership icon to even use the card to begin with. 
It isn't that it only lets you cheat attachments and allies, if you look at Seastans post you can even play cards like Thicket of Spears and Skyward Volley with Vilya, but rather only removes all cost from a card. If there are additional stipulations (like on Strength of Arms where each hero needs to have a printed leadership icon) THEN Vilya can't work around them but it definitely can cheat into play events as well...

> I think most card effects either use "enter play" or ""when played from your hand" and I think it's clear that one of these does not work with Vilya and one of them does. Erebor Hammersmith is an interesting exception though.

 

I have received a ruling from Caleb regarding this situation that, to my knowledge, had never been answered by a developer until now, though I may have overlooked it.

 

> Q: If you exhaust Elrond and Vilya to reveal an ally on the top of your deck can you : 1) put him into play at no cost, 2) play him at no cost, or 3) choose to play him at no cost or put him into play?

>  
> 
> A: When you use Vilya’s ability and the top card of your deck is an ally or attachment, you put it into play. The added language about “play at no cost” is there for when the top card of your deck is an event, because you don’t put events into play.
