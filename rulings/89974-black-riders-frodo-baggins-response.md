So I know not many people have it, but I figure I'd throw it out there because it's pretty vague. Can you use Frodo's response to cancel (for example) the Hide 2 triggered by revealing a Black Rider from the encounter deck; and then subsequently shuffle him back into the encounter deck? Is it really :that: powerful?

For posterity (and Rich!):

I figure he wouldn't mind me posting it here since the card has already been spoiled by FFG anyway
