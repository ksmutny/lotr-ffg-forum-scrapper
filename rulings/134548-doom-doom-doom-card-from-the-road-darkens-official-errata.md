# [Doom, doom, doom card from the Road Darkens - official errata](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134548-doom-doom-doom-card-from-the-road-darkens-official-errata/)

I've received an answer from Caleb for my question regarding effects on Doom, doom, doom card. So I share, maybe someone find it interesting...

 

Here is my question:

 

What happens if I choose to remove the last damage token from Doom, doom, doom card due to "When revealed" effect of Moria Orc during staging step of quest phase (Moria Orc effect is: "Either remove 1 damage from Doom, doom or reveal an additional encounter card")? Is Balrog still added to staging area at the end of that quest phase (or at all then)? Text on Doom, doom says: "At the end of the quest phase, remove 1 dmg token. THEN, if there are no damage tokens here, add the Balrog to the staging area."
In FAQ there is written: "(1.15) The word "then": If a card effect uses the word "then", then the preceding effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent dependent effect to resolve." But the preceding effect didn’t resolve succesfully - the last token was already removed earlier, by Moria Orc effect, so I can't remove it at the end of the quest phase.

 

(BTW: There is also a treachery card "Fool of a Took!" with similar effect to Moria Orc).

 

I thought I'd found a backdoor for not putting Balrog into play, but here is what Caleb answered:

 

Ignore the word “then” on Doom, Doom, Doom. The Balrog is added to the staging area at the end of the quest phase if there are no tokens left on the objective.

I will probably have to add an FAQ entry to clarify that there is no way to keep the Balrog from entering play when there are no tokens left on Doom, Doom, Doom.

 

So, there is no way to avoid Balrog other than quest like mad in this scenario.

This is clearly a case of someone trying to find a loophole and play a card as it was not intended. Now Caleb has to spend time and energy to do an errata. Sigh...the Balrog comes out, that's the whole point.

I actually think that was a valid questions to have. It is not about loopholes, it is about having a good understanding of the game rules (or, if you look from a technical angle, the whole point is to learn how things trigger and structure your plays accordingly to gain favorable position).

 

I would say the sole fact that Caleb told us to "ignore" certain part of the card text shows that it was important to ask.

Time for official explanation of my post :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

When I played this scenario and such situation arose, it seemed to me un-thematic (but I can live playing e.g. Steward of Gondor on Sam or Pippin, so I could live without Balrog appearing, too ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ) that the Balrog, provided that Moria Orc was revealed at the right time, would be Sir Not-Appearing-in-This-Game, so I just ask Caleb to clarify. I've asked Caleb a couple of questions in the same message regarding some effects of the Road Darkens cards, but this one seemed so important to me, that I posted it here titled "official errata". And this IS essential clarification to me, because in fact, according to the clarification of the word "then" in FAQ, the Balrog could not appear in the game without it. We also have similar case explained in latest FAQ 1.7 with The Power of Mordor card.

English in not my native language. If I knew that this word "backdoor" was so meaningful I'd have used another or add ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]  When we talk about rules clarifications we absolutely should be very literal (as I was in this case and am in general), but please, do not judge someone's intention based on one little word... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  It was not obvious to me how to treat such case, that's all. Also, I know little about designer's intention, I just want to correctly play the game.

Cheers, no offence :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

krokodiler, I hope this exchange doesn't dampen your enthusiasm for participating in future discussions on these boards. Just a little honest misunderstanding between posters/avid fans of the game, all with good intentions, and it's all too easy for that to occur in a medium like this one. I am grateful that you took the time to share Caleb's reply to your question.

 

krokodiler = "crocodiles" in Danish, correct (and maybe Norwegian, Swedish and Icelandic, but I don't have time to check)?
