Hey Guys!

 

I'm going crazy over this, so please help me.

 

I've read everything there is to read, and it really makes no sense to me, that i'm told to resolve the guarded keyword when i travel to Forest Grove, and then pick up the Athelas from the encounter deck. I know that people say that i shouldn't do it when picking the athelas up from the discard pile. And i agree with that. But why should i trigger the guarded keyword, just because i pick up the Athelas from the encounter deck? The way i see it, the card is never revealed from the encounter deck, and therefore shouldn't trigger the guarded keyword.

 

The FAQ (1.4) says:

 

(1.01) Encounter Keywords Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur is revealed from the encounter deck, including during setup.

 

And also:

 

 

 

(1.22) "When Revealed" Effects

A card is only considered to be revealed if the card or game effect causing the card to enter play specifically uses a form of the word "reveal".

 

 

 

Forest Grove reads:


Response: After the players explore Forest Grove, search the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 Athelas objective, and add it to the staging area. Then, shuffle the encounter deck.

 

Nowhere does it say reveal.

 

Is everybody really wrong, or is there something i'm not seeing?

 

And some official answer would be great! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Also official answer from caleb :

 

> Because the Athelas is not revealed when you trigger the Response of Forest Grove, you place an unguarded Athelas in the staging area.

Agreed. It has be answered.  It is not guarded when you find it from the Forest Grove response.
