With Eleanor or Spirit Merry.

So how are people feeling about this combo? It's existed ever since the Tireless Ranger boon was introduced, but I think people just kind of accepted it because it can only happen in campaign mode.

Merry with Wingfoot means you can reduce your threat every time an enemy is revealed.  That means you can pair Merry with any 2 other heroes -- why not Elrond and Gandalf for example?  -- and reasonably expect to get down into Secrecy in games with a higher player count.

Eleanor with Wingfoot means you can ignore all treacheries in every game.  You still have to be prepared for 1) cards that say "cannot be cancelled," and 2) more locations and enemies to replace the treacheries you're cancelling.  And of course you still have Doomed and Surge to deal with.  But still, this 2-card and 2-cost combo (3 counting the hero, but you don't have to draw into that card) shuts down one type of card in the counter deck permanently.  

Just wondering how people feel these combos.  Cool with it?  Think it deserves errata?  Have you tried it or seen others try it?

Personally, if I were designing a game and there was a card combo someone could reasonably get on turn 1 that would nullify 1/3 of the cards I design, I'd errata it, regardless of whether people think it's good or not. So I'd expect Wingfoot to get an errata requiring it to exhaust to ready the hero, considering that's how Caleb imagined it working it the first place.

But given that we went this year without our regularly scheduled FAQ update, I'm guessing our ability to self-police silly combos over the years has been noticed and errata is not considered as important as it once was. I would like a FAQ update with all the rule clarifications that have been made about the last couple cycles though.

Asked Caleb and here is his reply :

With the way the cards are currently written, it is legal to make Eleanor a Ranger and cancel every treachery revealed with Wingfoot. This is a problem we saw coming with the inclusion of Doughty Ranger in the Haradrim cycle, and the intention has always been to give errata to Wingfoot so that it reads: “Response: After attached hero commits to a quest, name enemy, location, or treachery. If a card of the named type is revealed during this quest phase, exhaust Wingfoot to ready attached hero.” That would prevent Eleanor from canceling more than 2 treachery cards each quest phase. The only reason that errata has not been released yet is because FAQ 1.9 has been deprioritized and delayed due to shifts in our workflow.
 
Feel free to share this news with anyone you wish if you’re getting frustrated with this combo since it is our intention that Wingfoot be restricted to a limit of once per round.
 
Cheers,
Caleb
