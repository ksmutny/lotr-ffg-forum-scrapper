# [Strider&#039;s Path and &quot;Immune to player card effects&quot;](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229251-striders-path-and-immune-to-player-card-effects/)

A rules question:

Let's say that The Carrock, or any "Immune to player card effects" Location is currently Active.

You reveal a Location from the encounter deck. You play Strider's Path, which makes the just-revealed Location suddenly Active. Strider's Path instructs you to move The Carrock to the Staging Area, but you cannot (as it is Immune to player card effects).

You now have two Active Locations, as a result. Does this conclusion sound accurate?

Or simply you can't play Strider's Path with an "Immune to player card effects" Active location in play?

Thank you

STRIDER'S PATH

Response: After a location is revealed from the encounter deck, immediately travel to that location without resolving its Travel effect. If another location is currently active, return it to the staging area.

> So are we thinking the core set manual's "the players can only travel to one location at a time" is a restriction on travelling only (and has no bearing on card effects)?

 

I think that I disagree with most of the conclusions in this thread, and GrandSpleen has hit on why. I think that this rule will affect any card that tells the players to "travel" to a location. So not just the normal framework effect, but Strider's Path and Ghân-buri-Ghân [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Ghan-buri-Ghan-TFotW] (which both use the word "travel") would be limited to one location at a time. (Fisherman's Dock [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Fisherman] from The Battle of Lake-Town would not, because that card specifically says "There are now two active locations", which overrides the travel rule.)

 
So in the absence of something like Fisherman's Dock that explicitly allows two active locations, I'd say that Strider's Path and Ghân-buri-Ghân will be unable to work if the current active location is immune to player card effects. In order for them to work, you must be able to return the active location to the staging area, otherwise you end up having traveled to two locations at once, which is forbidden. If you can't return the active location to the staging area, the one you're trying to travel to "bounces" off of it and lands back in the staging area again. FAQ section 1.34 applies to Fisherman's Dock because it explicitly creates two active locations, but nothing else in the rules allows for two active locations. In fact, the way the rules put it is "Players cannot travel to a new location if another location card is active; the players must explore the active location before traveling elsewhere." (Emphasis in original).
 
So I'm firmly convinced that, absent an official ruling to the contrary, the right way to play this situation is that if the active location is immune to player card effects, Strider's Path doesn't work at all.
 
UPDATE: However, there's been an official ruling from Caleb on a similar interaction (Dreadful Gap vs. East-Gate in Khazad-dûm). See below; the summary is that if the current active location is immune to player card effects, Strider's Path would work after all, and would create a second active location. So this post of mine has turned out to be wrong.

> I remember an official answer where Carrock isn't move, so there are 2 active locations...

 

You might be thinking of this one: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1208506/rules-questions-pit-encounter [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1208506/rules-questions-pit-encounter]

 

That interaction was between East-Gate ("Immune to card effects" -- not just player card effects, ALL card effects) and Dreadful Gap ("When Revealed: Immediately travel to Dreadful Gap. If another location is currently active, return it to the staging area."). The majority appeared to think that East-Gate would prevent Dreadful Gap from triggering. However, you got an answer from Caleb and posted it in the thread:

> If Dreadful Gap is revealed while East-Gate is the active location, the first line of Dreadful Gap’s ‘when revealed’ effect will make it the active location, but East-Gate’s immunity will prevent the second line of Dreadful Gap’s ‘when revealed’ effect from resolving. So, yes, you will end up with two active locations.

 

The text involved here is very much the same as Strider's Path / The Carrock (or any other immune location), and so the ruling would apply too.

 

So it turns out that I was wrong: by official Caleb ruling, if Carrock (or another immune location) is the active location, playing Strider's Path is still legal, and makes you end up with two active locations.

It wouldn't hurt to double check this one with Caleb, too.

I sent Caleb a question just to confirm.

Confirmed

 

> Hi Jim,
> If you play Strider’s Path to travel to a location while there is an active location that is immune to player card effects, you will end up with two active locations because the active location’s immunity will prevent it from being returned to the staging area by the second part of the event’s effect. Item 1.34 in the FAQ says: “If a card effects causes two locations to be active at the same time, they are both considered to be the active location.”
