This was talked about a bit in another thread, but my question here is a bit different.

 

> Wingfoot
> 
>  
> 
> Attach to a Ranger hero. Response: After attached hero commits to a quest, name enemy, location, or treachery. If a card of the named type is revealed during this quest phase, ready attached hero.

 

1.  What happens if you use Wingfoot (name enemy), Wingfoot gets discarded by some effect, and then you reveal an enemy?  Does the word "attached" refer to the character at the time of activation or at the time the enemy is revealed?

 

I assume the former, but want to know if others agree.

 

2.  Similarly, if you have Sword-thain attached to a Ranger ally (now hero due to Sword-thain) and attach Wingfoot to that character and Sword-thain gets discarded after activating Wingfoot.  After Sword-thain gets discarded the named card type for Wingfoot gets revealed.  Does Wingfoot whiff since the character is no longer a hero (similar to Sword-thain Sneak Attack combo, but backwards)?

I think that's a question for Caleb.  You're in Sneak Attack/Sword-Thain territory, and I didn't find that ruling to be very intuitive.

Yeah, I actually think our conversation the other day regarding Saruman and my example of Wingfoot being similar made me question the Sneak Attack/Sword-thain ruling but didn't realize it until I was making this post about Wingfoot getting discarded (and thus, no longer being "attached").  It just doesn't make sense.  These (let's call them) "hanging" effects seem to happen at the time of activation for things to be intuitive.  However, the Sneak Attack/Sword-thain ruling seems to be the opposite of that...

 

If "hanging" effects are determined at the time of activation (like lasting effects), then in my two examples it would be:

 

1.  Ready character

2.  Ready character

> Black Arrow adds 5 attack when the attached hero declares an attack. The hero is attached at that time and the 5 attack then persists through the attack.
> 
> Wingfoot sets up a delayed effect that triggers when an enemy is revealed. In your scenario the effect triggers at a time when the hero is not attached.

 

Not sure I follow, "add Black Arrow to the victory display to give "attached hero" (there is none because Black Arrow has already been added to the victory display) +5 Attack for this attack

 

Say Wingfoot is attached to Aragorn.  Perhaps this is how we are supposed to interpret such cards.

 

> Attach to a Ranger hero. Response: After attached hero (from hereon out "attached hero" is Aragorn) commits to a quest, name enemy, location, or treachery. If a card of the named type is revealed during this quest phase, ready attached hero (Aragorn).

 

Edit: If that is the way we are supposed to interpret such cards, then it seems to contradict the Sword-thain Sneak Attack ruling.  Because Sneak Attack would be interpreted as such if it were consistent:

 

Action: Put 1 ally (from hereon out the "ally" is Gandalf) card into play from your hand. At the end of the phase, if that ally (Gandalf) is still in play, return it to your hand.

 

 

I will have to email Caleb when I can.
