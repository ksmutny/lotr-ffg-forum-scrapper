Am I able to do this. If I have beregond hero, can I play dark knowledge attachment on to him as long as I have a lore hero and use his resources to pay for it?

I am still confused for the rulling coming from joking during gencon between danpo and Caleb on Beorn whose attachments would not be discarded after he recovers from his texts blankening.
