I've been doing a lot of thinking about what the next deluxe expansion and AP series will be about and I've come to the following conclusion:

Deluxe Expansion = Rohan, probably centered around the ascent of Grima Wormtongue and Theoden's slip into delusion.

Adventure Packs = Boromir's journey from Gondor to Rivendell.

Here's my rationale. We know that the timeline will be between the Hobbit and the LotR books. Looking at the big stories that Tolkien wrote for this time period, most of them have already been covered (golum's story, the failed return to Moria by the dwarves, the troubles in Gondor). What's left? Tolkien specifically wrote about the corruption of Saruman, the assault on Dol Guldur, the troubles in Rohan, Boromir's journey north, and the ride of Ring Wraiths north to Hobbiton. I think Saruman's tale doesn't really lend itself to the kinds of adventures we've seen so far and I really doubt we'll go back to Dol Guldur so soon after the Mirkwood cycle.

Of the stories that are left, I think Rohan lends itself nicely to a three quest deluxe expansion, and more importantly, it easily provides the encounter sets to enable Boromir's journey north to be the next AP cycle. Why do I think Boromir's tale will be next? First of all, it's a truly epic journey. Boromir travelled west from Gondor, through Rohan and the Gap and then through the wildlands and north to the ruins of Tharbad where he lost his horse trying to cross the great river Greyflood. After losing his horse he had to go the rest of the way to Rivendell on foot. This would make an amazing story, something Tolkien said himself : "the courage and hardihood required is not fully recognized in the narrative". That's the kind of journey I'd like to see in an AP cycle. Tolkien's lack of detail about the journey is actually a blessing to the game designers as they can have some fun filling in the details of the story. The regions around Tharbad were also not in the movies giving the designers some freedom to conceptualize them however they want. The fact that a third of the trip is through Rohan would dovetail very nicely with the Deluxe Expansion.

So there's my prediction. What do you think?

3.we have never actually had a cycle centered around a main character…..the hunt for gollum cycle did hint to aragorns quest, but he never actually featured. also we alreday have 2 boromirs, im not sure theres room for another (not that there would have to be, it would just make sense)

 

I don't see this as inconsistent with what FFG has already done.  We HAVE seen a cycle centered around a main character (Aragorn in the hunt for Gollum, as you mentioned), but the designers took the source material and simply made it generic.  We know the hunt for Gollum was Aragorn's thing, but FFG set it up as "Gandalf has requested help finding the creature Gollum…. our intrepid adventurers answer the call!"  Aragorn isn't mentioned and doesn't feature as a new hero in the Mirkwood cycle.  We do have 2 Boromirs already, but setting up a generic "Elrond has summoned a council…. you must answer the call" would be just as easy to do, and following precedent, we wouldn't need to see a new Boromir to make this work.

But!  What I am interested in is the designer quote that came at the end of a semi-recent developer article.  In the article where they discuss the new tournament rules (here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3993]), Caleb/Matthew/Nate write:

"Speaking of unannounced projects, there are some really exciting things in store for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, and we look forward to sharing them with all of you when the time is right. Until then, we hope you continue to enjoy all your travels in Middle-earth!"

I haven't seen any forum speculation about this -- maybe I missed it?  Anyway, the only things that we have gotten since then are the previews for the last 2 APs in Against the Shadow, and the Second Breakfast articles.  Those certainly don't satisfy the quote above, in my opinion.  I think something bigger is coming -- not just any old new deluxe.  Maybe FFG has acquired the rights to develop saga expansions based on the actual trilogy? That's where my hope lies!
