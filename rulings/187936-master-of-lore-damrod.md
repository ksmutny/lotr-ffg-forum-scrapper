Can Master of Lore and Damrod use their text to reduce a 2 cost trap down to 0 cost?

 

Here are their text:

> Hi Caleb, question for you about stacking cost reduction effects.
> 
>  * Grima, Damrod, Theoden, Heir of Valandil, A Good Meal, and Beregond can reduce costs to play cards down to 0.
>  * Master of Lore, O Lorien, and To the Sea, To the Sea! can reduce costs to play cards down to 1.
>  * Secrecy, Guthlaf, Dwalin, Citadel Custodian, Take No Notice, In the Shadows, and the Record attachments have built-in cost reduction effects.
> 
> When I am combining two or more of the above effects, can I choose the order in which they are applied? Here are some distinct examples:
>  
> 1) I discard 4 cards to lower the cost of Gildor Inglorion using To the Sea, then trigger Grima to reduce his cost to 0.
> 2) Exhaust Master of Lore and name "Event", reducing the cost of Out of the Wild by 1, then if I am in Secrecy it becomes cost 0.
> 3) Exhaust Master of Lore and name "Attachment", then playing Ranger Spikes for free with Damrod.
> 4) Exhaust Master of Lore and name "Attachment", reducing the cost of Scroll of Isildur by 1. Then, If I have 3 Lore heroes, it becomes free.

 

 

> You can choose the order in which you resolve effects, so you can reduce a card’s cost to a minimum of 1 with one effect and then reduce it down to 0 with another effect. Each of your examples look to be correct in that regard.

> Cheers,
> Caleb

Like you said earlier though, Damrod is a passive, not an effect you are choosing.  So Caleb's response doesn't necessarily apply to that scenario since Damrod is in effect first, followed by MoL's triggered effect.

Look at example 3.
