Stage 1F reads:

 

Forced: At the beginning of the round (before the resource phase), place 1 resource here. Then, if there are 4 resources here, advance to stage 2.

 

Stage 2F reads:

 

Forced: At the beginning of the round, add 1 set aside Host of Angmar (from any stage's set aside area) to this staging area.

 

 

Am I correct in assuming that you do not put a set aside Host of Angmar into play on the round you move from stage 1 to stage 2, since you would trigger all "beginning of round" effects once only, and Stage 2F was not in play at that moment?

I asked Caleb that question at Gen Con and he confirmed this assumption.

I just emailed Caleb and he said I was correct.
