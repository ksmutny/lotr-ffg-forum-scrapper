Very exciting news today! (The cards part for me anyhow, although pricey)  After all the news lately what's left to be excited about?  This is fun speculation not the game is ending talk. 

 

Player cards-

Hero-

Saruman 

Radagast 

Gollum?!

Spirit Aragorn

A New Bilbo 

Thranduil

(Caleb has mentioned we have a lot of Bilbos, Frodos, and Aragorns with the sagas, so I won't he surprised if we get no more)

Locations

I can't think of any large geographical areas yet unexplored 

 

Concepts 

It seemed like Caleb teased some kind of campaign play in the state of the lcg article?

Any thoughts?

The most likely place to go next would seem to be Dorwinion/ Rhun/ the East, maybe with a few Mordor-area quests to round out the cycle. And in Dale we're at the logical jumping off point geographically (not that I think that matters much).  I don't expect we'll ever get to see the Blue Wizards as cards, but the East would be a natural place to explore more 'wizardy' stuff; various cults, Sauron trying to influence its peoples via dark magics, etc. Tolkien doesn't give us much, and some details are delightfully contradictory (as to the success of the Blue Wizards for instance) but Caleb has shown his skill in making clever nods to the lore, and that could be easily done without needing to take direct names or quotes from the Silmarillion or other material beyond the license. 

Also interested in phorcys12's suggestion of south Eriador/west Gondor. Like the East, it will require a lot of creation and extrapolation, but I don't have a problem with that. There are areas like Eryn Vorn that look able to hide all sorts of interesting secrets.

I must be the only one not interested in having a spirit Aragorn! In general, I like to see completely new heroes (from the lore or FF-created), and was particularly pleased to see the new Gildor. My wish would be a couple more hobbits like Farmer Maggot or maybe a named Took from the Appendices, Thorin's sister Dis, and lots of ally versions of heroes we already have (Aragorn included!)
