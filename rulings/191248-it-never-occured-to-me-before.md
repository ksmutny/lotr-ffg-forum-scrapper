But today, when browsing through cards, this thing caught my eye:

It reads "gains". This means that effects like:

I actually asked Caleb for clarification about those paragraphs.  In that set of paragraphs it is not clear.  I was unable to get a definite answer from Caleb, so until then I think either interpretation is fair play and in some instances moving being gaining resources actually hurts the player.

Wrong.

 

Here is a quote from one of email conversations with Caleb:

 

“Moving” and “adding” resources both fall under the umbrella of “gaining” resources (i.e. If I move a resource from Gloin to Aragorn, Aragorn has gained a resource), but “moving” a resource does not qualify as “adding” a resource. In order to add a resource, there must be a +1 total count in resources (i.e. I play Wealth of Gondor to add a resource to Boromir’s resource pool increasing my total resource count by +1).
