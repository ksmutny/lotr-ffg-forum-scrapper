Is it just me, or are there no "rest places" in The Land of Shadow where we get to change our hero selections? I have been wondering how they were going to handle the split fellowship, and it seems the answer is that they're not handling it at all. It seems that the same heroes who march on Isengard pretty much have to time travel back and follow Frodo now.

 

Unless I missed something? (I hope I missed something).

Ian and I mentioned this to Caleb at Gen Con - this was accidentally omitted from the rules insert. Because you are switching between the Aragorn and Frodo stories, the players get to switch heroes for free (before the first quest). I'm sure they will be issuing a clarification about this shortly, but I wanted to pass this information along to anyone who was wondering.

Are you required to switch heroes though? I know it makes sense thematically, but from a gameplay standpoint I'd hate to switch out my lineup after they've done so well for me.

That's really good to hear! I'm glad I don't have to try to justify that one to myself thematically.
