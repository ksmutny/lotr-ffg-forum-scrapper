What will happen to a side quest when you complete it, if it cannot go into the victory display?  Many SQs have "Limit 1 copy in the victory display."

Just imagining something like Conflict at the Carrock, where I don't want to advance to the next stage immediately.  If I happen to have 2 copies of Keep Watch or something, but haven't drawn into another SQ yet, I can complete the first 1, putting it in the victory display, then quest toward the 2nd one. When I complete it... will it stay on the table, allowing me to infinitely delay advancement to stage 2 of the quest?  Or will it be discarded and go into my discard pile?

Here you go:

You should remove that side quest from the game. I will make a note to include this question in the next FAQ update.
