I've put the deck together, read the story and race rules but I've not yet examined the encounter cards and quest stages. I'm going to play my first game blind. 

I'm tempted just to use the deck that I beat City of Ulfast with, which was a Gondor leadership rush and chump deck. I almost always go to the next quest playing with winning deck of the previous quest but it rarely works for me. The designers have often said they don't want players to do that and create quests that use different mechanics to stop a deck dead in its tracks forcing you to create a new deck. 

So I'm just going to use the next deck i had lined up for City Of Ulfast which was Seanstans Dale Force deck and see how it goes and what this quest is all about. 

Difficulty 5 this one... 

So, what are your thoughts on beating this quest? How was it for you, low points high points? What deck won and is it easier or harder than a 5?

I'll post my game here when I've played it through. 

Stay safe everybody.

I guess once the Wainriders defeat a stage they are removed just like it says to do with the challengers progress, but it wasn't directly clear. I haven't looked at all the encounter cards so I'm not sure if there is something on one of them that clears it. Th

 
This is Caleb's answer (I will tag you @sappidus [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/251007-sappidus/] in case you would be interested) confirming the most logical answer (and what I guess we all played by already)
