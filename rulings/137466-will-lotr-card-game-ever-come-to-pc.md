I had my first game (solo) in about 6 weeks last night, and I relished it. I'm questing Conflict at the Carrock and assembled a mighty deck to tackle it. I had forgotten just have incredible this game is.

 

However, I would love to play this via Steam on a PC.

 

Do you think this will ever happen?

Okay, I'll chime in here (context: I am a programmer and have been for many years).  I agree with Dan and GrandSpleen: creating a stable engine for this game would NOT be easy.  You could cobble one that works with what we have now, but then as each expansion came out (with new mechanics, new keywords, new overrides), the code would grow to look like Frankenstein's monster as programmers would need to rework everything to fit.  Just think about all the questions we send in to Caleb: the programmers would ask all of those and even more.

 

I'm not saying it couldn't be done - just that it wouldn't be easy.  (One last thought: the UI would also be hard - imagine being able to provide a tool tip to the user as to why they a character couldn't perform an action that normally they could but are now blocked by some other effect).
