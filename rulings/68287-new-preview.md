thorin- as expected really- artwork already spoiled early in the game, nice ability in a dwarf deck, still not as good as dain?? though with a couple of erebor record keepers and a 3 dwarf hero deck he could be collecting 2 resources by the early rounds

others had already been spoiled but nice to see an english version- both great cards

i like the designer's take on the characters- especially gandalf and the party being terrified and relaxed when he comes and goes

NOTE the 'at least ONE famous hobbit' - probably getting another then?

yeah that is what it looks like.. kind of like an objective.. but it says in the trailer that it is a "player card" I am more woundering aboout when you build decks for other quests… like do you put it in teh encounter deck or somthing?



They almost certainly will only be relevant in some sort of linked campaign (Nightmare mode, or whatever similar variant is introduced in the boxed set). I suspect they'll have player card backs (the ring design) but have special scenario rules setting them aside (a la The Watcher). They'll probably be "unlocked" by exploring a certain location or progressing past a particular quest stage. Then, when you play the next scenario(s) in that progression, you can include the treasures in your draw deck. But it seems like you won't be able to just put treasures in your deck and play, say, Massing at Osgiliath. They only work within Hobbit scenarios, and only if you play those scenarios as a connected campaign.

I'm particularly intrigued by Caleb's revelation that treasures are immune to effects that target attachments. From the FAQ, we know that treasures should count as attachments (as any card that attaches to another card is considered an attachment in addition to its other types). So, there must be an explicit rule granting treasures this special protection.

This bothered me as well. I wonder if Caleb just misremembered when he typed that up? Or if there really will be special extra rules for the treasures. I guess it'd make sense since they're special cards and it would suck to earn one only to have it discarded to some lowly encounter card, but still, kinda goes against all other similar rulings up to this point. Though I guess that shouldn't surprise me either…

the designers just do not put as much work into the rules systems as they do in say CoC or aGoT. The focus in this game as it is not competitive is to make each quest or expansion function , be fun and play well in isolation. It wouldn't surprise me if this inconsistency is simply nvr discussed ..
