Question on the wording of this card.  The text says:

 

"...Forced: After a time counter is removed from the current quest, attached hero takes one damage."

 

Does the card stay attached once the current quest stage is completed or is it then discarded upon completion?

 

Example:  Heroes are in stage 2 of Nin-Eilph quest and this card is revealed during staging.  Card is attached to hero A.  End of turn, a time counter is removed and hero A takes one damage.  On next turn, players successfully quest through stage 2 and move to stage 3.  What happens to In Need of Rest?

 

Thanks.

Probably they were leaving open some design space for future scenarios.  "In Need of Rest" belongs to the Weary Travelers set and can appear in several scenarios; while we did NOT get a scenario in the cycle where you have multiple quest stages active at the same time (like with Battle of Five Armies), if you did have such a quest, with multiple time counters being removed from multiple quest cards each round, the card would be too punishing.  Caleb has responded to such seemingly unnecessary wording in the past in that way: saying he's leaving design space open for options when designing the Nightmare mode for a quest.
