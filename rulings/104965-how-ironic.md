...that best scrying card in the game, in my opinion, is Longbeard Elder. Yes, a leadership ally. With all tha fuss around lore.

I sent a question to Caleb.

> I sent a question to Caleb.

 

All I see is Booored being counter argued with quote from the rulebook. 

Also, I had the other part already :

 



> Page 14 of the rule book says “Players commit characters to the quest as a team, starting with the first player, and then proceeding clockwise around the table.” That means that players commit their characters to the quest one at a time in turn order. Player 1 must resolve committing characters to the quest before player 2 has the opportunity to commit his characters. If player 1 wants to use Aragorn’s Response effect, then it must be activated immediately after he commits to the quest. This will be resolved before player 2 has had the option to commit characters to the quest.

 

With this, it answer our question entirely.

Here is the official answer which is quite clear:

 

> Hi Jörg,
> Good to hear from you again.
> Players commit characters to the quest during a green action window. That means it is possible to take actions both before and after committing characters to the quest. For example, I can play Sneak Attack to put Gandalf into play and trigger his Response effect before committing characters to the quest. That will allow me to commit Gandalf to the quest as well.
> Furthermore, after I have committed characters to the quest, I can still take actions before proceeding to the staging step. For example, I can play Elrond’s Counsel to increase my willpower by 1 and lower my threat by 3 before any “when revealed” effects might raise my threat.
> With regard to the Longbeard Elder’s ability specifically: because his Response triggers after committing him to the quest, you can look at the top card of the encounter deck and there is still an opportunity for you to take an action afterwards. So, you could see that the top card of the deck is an enemy and decide to play the event Expecting Mischief in order to deal 2 damage to that enemy when it is revealed during the staging step.
> I haven’t actually tried that combo yet, but now that it’s been mentioned I think I will!

> He even used my same Longbeard Elder/Expecting Mischief example.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah, that was great. I didn't even mention that combo, but he immediatly came up with it. Great minds think alike, it appears.

 

And I have to say that Caleb is really a friendly and nice guy. I asked him how they can handle all these rules and that I'm glad that even the designers can learns something new about the game. His response:

 

> We keep pretty busy, but we’re also happiest that way. It’s always great to get questions & comments from our players because that’s a great indicator of the game’s vitality. 
> Another fun part of working on the game is when players discover combos that we haven’t thought of, like the Longbeard Elder & Expecting Mischief. I can’t believe I haven’t done that yet. I even have both of those cards in the same deck! I just don’t think I’ve ever had the option to play both at the same time.
