As the title says I am firstly being hopeful that the game will be back, perhaps in alooking to see what the thoughts are 

 

- more sailing but in the North seas this time with 4 new ships but being able to play with the ones from Dreamchaser for more cool connections. We could go find out what is on the island of Himling. See what sort of creatures are in the Icebay of Forochel and maybe even go off the map! Obviously more encounters with sea monsters, pirates but in a more northern theme, so even have to icebreak through waters.

- shire is certainly an option for a reduced high acuity change of pace (which may actually make it a good post Mordor cycle quest). Could start with in the Shire quests that branch out to Bree Land and a non-saga romp into The Old Forest/Barrowdowns. 

- they could bump up the timeline a bit and let you play during the War of the Ring. Battling in Moria, Orc-hunting in Lothlorien, raising forces with the Dunedain to ride to their king, moving the Huorns in Rohan, helping fight pirates in south Gondor. Supporting quests throughout the saga timeline that were occurring offscreen.

 

So what is everyone else's thoughts? Any ideas on specific quests, stories or locations?

Great list Dale! See Caleb, tons of content left! And also yes Campaigns would be awesome. Ways to upgrade your heroes like the Sagas, earning new heroes maybe even getting access to one hero and their forces or the other depending on choices. Lots of cool ways they could go.
