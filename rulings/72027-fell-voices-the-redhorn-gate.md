I am trying The Redhorn Gate today.  I am on 3B of the quest, with Caradhras being the active location.  I reveal Fell Voices (TRG 2/29) which reads:
"When Revealed: Return the top 2 Snow cards in the encounter discard pile to the top of the encounter deck…"

In the encounter discard pile, the topmost snow card is a Snow Warg (TRG 29/29) and the next one is Avalanche! (TRG 21/29).  My question is do I have to put the topmost one (i.e. Snow Warg) on the encounter deck first and then Avalanche! on its top (i.e. next card I reveal from the encounter deck will be Avalanche!), or I can take these two cards out from the discard pile and rearrange their order to be put on the encounter deck?

In this game, I use the first approach and then Avalanche! (in cooperation with 3B quest card) would kill all but two of my characters on board.  I am relying on Dain Ironfoot to give everyone (but Arwen) +1 boost to willpower.  Since Avalanche! would exhaust Dain and commit him to quest, everyone would loose that boost, plus the effect of Caradhras which -1 willpower to all who commits to quest, all drawf with printed willpower of 1 (including Dain himself) would be dead due to the effect of quest 3B.  Even I have a Lure of Moria that I can pay for (to ready all Drawf characters) would not save me, right?  Because before I can take an action, Dain will be exhausted and his boost is lost.  Avalanche! could be brutal in stage 3.

Hi Angus,
Because Fell Voices does not specify the order in which you return the 2 cards to the top of the encounter deck, then the first player will decide.
Cheers,
Caleb

Thanks Caleb for clarifying this!
