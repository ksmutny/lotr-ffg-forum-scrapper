In playing "The Road to Isengard", I have a couple of questions...

 

1) Orthanc location says "After the players quest successfully, the first player looks at the top 3 cards of the encounter deck, reveals 1, and discards the others." What if there is only 1 card left? Do I simply reveal it? Or draw it, shuffle discard pile back into the deck, draw 2 more, and make my decision?

 

2) Grima enemy says, "After Grima attacks a player, that player shuffles Grima back into the encounter deck and reveals an encounter card." What if the encounter deck is empty? Do I place him here and draw him? Or do I shuffle the discard pile and Grima back into the encounter deck first and then reveal a card?

Hehe. This is quite funny. I'm playing through the saga quests again, and I'm playing this same quest -- and I again came across this exact same scenario with Orthanc, where I have 1 card in the encounter deck, but I need to look at the top 3 cards. I did a Google search, and this original thread of mine immediately came up... but still no answer. I had sent the question to Caleb back then (almost 2 years ago) but never got a response. I've now resent that email today, so hopefully I can get a definitive answer.

 

That is, unless someone here now knows the answer from a similar situation after so much time has passed?

> If you posted this thread when you originally had the question, it wasn't 2 years ago -- 9 months only.

 
Wow, can't believe I didn't notice the year. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Anyway...
 
Response from Caleb, which verify what others have said...
 
1. If there is only 1 card left on the top of the encounter deck when you resolve Orthanc’s effect, you must reveal that card.
2. If there are no cards left in the encounter deck when Grima’s effect triggers, Grima would become the only card in the encounter deck, which means you would end up revealing him.
 
So I've one more question. The deck has 1 card in it at the start of the round. In a 2 player game, each now has to draw a card. Sarumon's effect is that when you draw cards, he is dealt 2 shadow cards and attacks. Do you reshuffle the encounter deck in this instance? Or do you only reshuffle the encounter deck when it's empty during the quest phase? (In which case, player 1 would only have 1 shadow card on Sarumon and player 2 would have none.)
