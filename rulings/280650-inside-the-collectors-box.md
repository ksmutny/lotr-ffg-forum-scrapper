There is an unboxing here if you want to see what's in the packs, I didn't watch it all

Yeah, I was pleasantly surprised with the unboxing and Caleb's thoughts on the card selection. I originally thought this was a complete alt-art version of the original Core. This has started to go into my "Need to buy" column now.

Thanks for posting!  For whatever reason, the lag is really bad on the video for me.  Will any good samaritan take the time to post what appears to be the content of the decks?

Same here.  I was hoping for just a couple repeats of single cards that I had (I only have one core), but this is truly a pleasant surprise.
