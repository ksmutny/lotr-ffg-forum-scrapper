# [Double surges?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187568-double-surges/)

The Hills of Emyn Muil quest instructs player that, if there are no locations in the staging area, the first threachery revealed gains Surge.

 

What if the first revealed Threachery already has surge? A single card can't double surge, right? So only one surge is resolved

 

Thanks for help

Might be worth asking Caleb?

 

While it may not explicitly say anywhere that Surge stacks, it also doesn't explicitly say anywhere that Surge does not stack.

 

Doomed stacks, so perhaps Surge does too? After all, the informal rule in this game is that the more difficult/challenging interpretation usually is the correct one?  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Hoping that in the end, Surge does not stack...

Thanks for that, Grand Spleen... you found what I unsuccessfully tried to find on the boards.

 

I definitely think we should ask Caleb to include this in the next FAQ -- it's important enough. And if he decides to reverse FFG's position on this matter, so much the better.

If we see cards with "Surge 2" on them in the Dream-Chaser cycle, I'm blaming you guys for giving Caleb ideas. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Orc Horn-blower already has the equivalent of Surge 2, and Night Without End(?) from Helm's Deep can "gain Surge 2". I think Caleb already had the idea...

I don't consider it "official" ruling unless it is included in the rule book or the Official FAQ.  If it's not in the Official FAQ, then it's 'unofficial' ruling, as far as I'm concerned, even if it came from Caleb, or any other FFG persona.
