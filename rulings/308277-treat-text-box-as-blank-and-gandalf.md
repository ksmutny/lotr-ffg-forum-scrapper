I'm playing through the LotR Saga in campaign mode, and drew the burden card "Shadow of Fear" which reads:

> Quote

I had Gandalf* in play at the time. So my question is, do I get to keep Gandalf for an extra turn?

 

* I'm actually using OHaUH Gandalf, so it's really only saving me raising my threat by an extra two to keep him. But I'll take what I can get!

While this is true, in the case of this treachery you aren't really deciding the order of the end of round effects -- you can't choose to handle Gandalf's end-of-round effect first while it is blanked, because while it is blanked it doesn't exist at all!  The question really is if End of Round effects that don't exist will pop back into play and have to be resolved after the end-of-round effect from the treachery expires.  Until end of round is a passive effect, but is the "until" inclusive of end-of-round or exclusive of end-of-round (both allowed by the English language).  I think interpreting end-of-round and end-of-phase effects as *inclusive* makes much more sense and presents less rules weirdness, but if memory serves we've seen Caleb embrace the exclusive-until weirdness with end-of-phase happenings, causing an action window in an end-of-phase test make "until end of phase" event worthless!

Mmmhh I guess you are right, I didn't see it that way. My bad.

Now that you mention it I guess I also remember something like this.

I believe I have found a ruling from Caleb. First I found this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180523-end-of-refresh-phase-vs-end-of-round/], which contains a link to this thread [http://sdajce.forumactif.org/t2461-question-gandalf-i-et-perte-de-son-texte-imprime-reponse-officielle] (in French, which I can't read), which contains this quote (in English) from Caleb:

> Quote
> 
> The Nine are Abroad reads "until the end of the round" at which time it's effect expires. At that time Gandalf's effect will require him to be discarded.

 The Nine are Abroad starts:

"When Revealed: Treat the text box of each character in play as blank (except for Traits) until the end of the round. [...]"

So it's basically the same thing and Gandalf is discarded.
