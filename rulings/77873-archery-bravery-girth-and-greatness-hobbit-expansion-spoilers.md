They've put up another preview of the Hobbit Saga expansion, with three new cards spoiled, and the new attachment is going to be legendary! “Combat Action: Choose an enemy in the staging area. Exhaust Great Yew Bow and attached hero to make a ranged attack against that enemy. Declare attached hero as the attacker. No other attackers can be declared for this attack.”

Even a slightly tooled up Legolas (or Bard for that matter) is going to do lots of fun damage with that. I also like that it's subtley less good than Hands Upon the Bow, because it can't be used to trim the staging area during questing, as it's a Combat Action. It's very nice.

Thoughts on Bombur? Actually could be quite useful, and I think nicely thematic.

I really loved it when Caleb wrote this:

"Now, I know what some players are thinking: “That’s great if you’re playing multiplayer where you can make Ranged attacks, but he’s no good to me in a single player game.” Well, just keep reading. What good is a bowman without his bow, anyway?"

I love how well he knows us and the game. I feel like the game's in really good hands with him.

Yes Caleb is really good. I always say he is best designer for now for this game!
