I've spent the past ten minutes trying to figure out what in the world this is: https://www.lotrcardgamecollection.com [https://www.lotrcardgamecollection.com]

It's a collaborative effort from FFG and Hachette.

It appears that it may actually be the "new form" of the game that was supposed to come after the hiatus. (If true, plans must have been accelerated.)

It's also not available outside of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, at least for now.

Whatever it is, the players of this game deserve some sort of comment or announcement from FFG for crying out loud!

From what we know:

1. The to be released collection is not the full game (insufficient volume).

2. FFG has made no announcement of this.

3. Distribution is UK/Ireland only. 

4. The new golden rule is “if you don’t know what something means, ignore it” (says so on tue pictures on the CotR fb page).

5. The promotion of this product relies on an initial bait offer and tacky (non)-descriptions of what the game is actually about.

6. Caleb was not aware of this.

For me the conclusion at hand is that this is a local attempt to cash in on existing material targeting an audience that is not aware of the current game’s existence. 

I think it is safe to say that this has nothing to do with the future (or non-future) of the game itself. Presumably, the reason we haven’t heard from it by FFG is that the product is not for the core gamer audience.

Not a peep from FFG about this and Caleb was unaware of this existing, different rules in certain spots (i.e. drawing 3 cards at setup, their "Golden Rule" of ignore stuff if you don't know etc.) looks sketchy AF.
