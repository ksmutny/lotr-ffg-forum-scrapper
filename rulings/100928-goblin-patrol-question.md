My son and I are really novice at this game, and we've been stumped by the Goblin Patrol card.  Maybe we are over thinking this, but we are really confused. 

 

So the card has each player search for enemies from both the discard pile and encounter deck.  Anything you take out of the encounter deck then just gets chucked into the discard pile again?  So really, the only thing you might have to face is a Patrol Leader, if there was one in the discard pile?  If I'm reading that right, what's the point?  Why not just throw a Patrol Leader out there from the discard pile and be done?  Also, once you clear any remaning enemies out, or if none exist, you just move on right? 

 

Just a little confused here....

> Hi Jan,
> 
> The Forced effect on Goblin Patrol is what we call a ‘replacement’ effect because it uses the word ‘instead.’ In order for a replacement effect to trigger, the effect that it is replacing must first attempt to resolve. In this case, an enemy that is revealed from the encounter deck and is about to be added to the staging area is replaced by placing that enemy in the discard pile instead.

> However, Goblin Follower’s ‘when revealed’ effect has it enter play engaged with the last player. That means it was not about to be added to the staging area, which means the replacement effect on stage 2B is not triggered. In short, the Goblin Follower will enter play engaged with the last player unless its ‘when revealed’ effect is canceled. If its ‘when revealed’ effect is canceled, then it would be added to the staging area and the forced effect on 2B would discard it instead.
