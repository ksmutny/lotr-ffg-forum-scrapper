While I'm at stage 2B [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Running-out-of-Time-MatPP], what happens if I "tie" during the quest phase (ie: I quest with 5 and after revealing an encounter card there is 5 threat on the staging area)? Is that considered to quest successfully, unsuccessfully, or none?

 

How does Ramshackle Manor [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Ramshackle-Manor-MatPP] work with Favor of the Valar [http://ringsdb.com/find?q=valar]?

Not sure if it strictly applies to this situation, but here's what Caleb said:

> Quote
> In every case where card text says that your threat “cannot be reduced” it means that the actual value on your threat dial cannot go down. This is important because there are several ‘threat reduction’ effects in the game that do not use the word reduce.
> For example, Elrond’s Counsel says “lower your threat by 3” but I think players understand that if I cannot reduce my threat, then I cannot use Elrond’s Counsel to lower it either. 
> Similarly, if I cannot reduce my threat then I cannot ‘set’ my threat to a value that is lower than my current one because I would have to reduce it in order to do that.
> I think you will find that Vanish from Sight can still be a useful card when playing Mount Doom, especially when it comes to making fortitude tests, but you cannot combo it with A Elbereth! Gilthonial! to reduce your threat. 

But Ramshackle Manor seems a little more nuanced than "cannot be reduced".

Caleb's answer:

 

Hi Rajam,
Any effect that causes the value of threat dial to go down is reducing your threat. Ramshackle Manor prevents your threat dial from being decreased by more than 1 each round. So if Ramshackle Manor is in play when Favor of the Valar triggers, you cannot reduce your threat by more than 1. If your threat is still 50 or higher after the effect resolves, then you will still be eliminated.
Hope you’re enjoying Murder at the Prancing Pony!
Cheers,
Caleb

So, thanks to Favor of The Valar, this mean that if you increase your threat more than 50 ( for example from 49 to 52), do you decrease threat level from 52 to 47 or from 50 to 45?
