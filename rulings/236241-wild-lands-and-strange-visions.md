I thought it was a nice article. It's a daring move by Matt and Caleb to add some sophistication to the Haradrim - generally they're just seen as enemies and that's it.

 

I'm sure FFG has no intention of aligning it's games with current politics, but as a Brit it's easy to see some of the attitudes and issues mentioned in the article being debated in the real world at the moment. Perhaps the Haradrim Cycle is just "applicable" rather than "allegorical" :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] !

how about prophetic instead, considering how long ago they started developing it!

This is why I love J.R.R. Tolkien and why I continue to love this game. His themes are readily applicable and no game is values neutral. Playing a game that is cooperative and based on Tolkien's themes therefore exercises, however discreetly, our capacity for fellowship and moral imagination.

 

Over the years, many have remarked on the quality of the community around the LOTR LCG. Given a genuinely wholesome source material and how carefully the designers have undertaken to bring it to life, I think that is no coincidence.

 

Thanks for reading my article and being such a great company of adventurers to follow!
