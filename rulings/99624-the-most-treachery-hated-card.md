We can open a new post with the next theme: the most treachery hated card.

 

In all the game, we have very bad experiencies about one treachery, and you finally hate that card a lot.

 

Which is this one, or various? (without thinking about Test of Will neither Eleanor :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

 

My vote is for:

You are preparing the combat against trolls and just before it is revealed: aaagh!

this has been answered by Caleb:

 

You count the Captains - but they cannot be removed - so it makes for an extra card revealed when this treachery shows up! i.e., you count the captain - but don't remove them.

I have seen this ruling referred to online, but I haven't actually seen the ruling itself - do you have a link? Presumably you would also count "To the Tower", by this ruling, since it is also in the staging area and cannot leave it.

 

I struggle to understand the rationale of this ruling giving the "Then" clause for the second sentence.

Caleb answers by e-mail, so there would never be a link.

 

I e-mailed him to ask about To The Tower, specifically, and will post his response once I hear back.

 

The "equal number" part can be confusing; does it refer to the equal number you counted or the equal number you shuffled? Caleb ruled it's equal to the number you counted, not shuffled. The card could be clearer, for sure.

 

My rule of thumb is, when in doubt, go for what makes it more difficult for the players. There are lots of folks trying to contort cards to make them do what they want it to do (Hands Upon the Bow is a prime example), or even this one. So, basically, if it makes it harder for me, I'll typically go with that interpretation. If it gets clarified that I was wrong later, all the better! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I meant a forum link where someone had posted an email from Caleb - the normal way for these rulings to disseminate into the community.

 

I too have submitted a request for a ruling and will also post any response.

 

Regarding the "Then" clause, I was referring to this from the FAQ: "If a card effect uses the word “then,” then the preceding effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent dependent effect to resolve. "

 

It seems to me that the first clause fails because you can't shuffle in Captains/To the Tower - therefore the "Then" clause does not resolve.

 

This whole issue is very murky at the moment (see the "Ered Nimrais" thread in the Rules forum).

While I know you don't believe me (yet), that is his ruling (I just can't find the e-mail). And the first clause can be satisfied - but the quest card trumps all for those cards that can't leave play. I just really don't see it as that confusing.

 

Now, if he says you count a captain but not To The Tower...then that really is confusing! Hahaha.

...and having this card playing multiple times due to a certain 'Lieutenant of mordor' being one of the new cards is even less fun!

I am with you here - harder is better, but I also want clear and consistent rules!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hi Matthew,

The Power of Mordor should read: 

"When Revealed: Count the number of encounter cards in the staging area and shuffle them into the encounter deck. Reveal an equal number of cards from the encounter deck and add them to the staging area. This effect cannot be canceled."

It should not use the word 'Then'. That will be corrected in the next FAQ.

Without the word 'Then', The Power of Mordor interacts with To The Tower and a Captain enemy like this:

-You count the number of encounter cards in the staging area, including To The Tower and the Captain enemy.

-Shuffle all the cards counted into the encounter deck, except To The Tower and the Captain enemy.

-You reveal the number of encounter cards that you counted and resolve their staging.

This does make The Power of Mordor a nastier treachery card in The Morgul Vale than in any previous scenario, since you are in a way revealing 2 additional encounter cards. However, it seemed fitting to us that The Power of Mordor should be stronger when you are in fact on the very doorstep of Mordor in that scenario.

Cheers,

Caleb

Snap, just got the same answer. I'm glad that the errata will make this fit with the "Then" rule.
