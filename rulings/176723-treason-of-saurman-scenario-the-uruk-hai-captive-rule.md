The rule is unclear in this scenario if the "captive" heroes generate influence to an influence pool for use by their owner. It is not worded like the "prisoner" is in the core box set scenario Escape from Dol Guldur, which fully described the restrictions. The captives are still considered in play and nothing says that their influence would not be generated or unusable by the owner. Nor have I found anything in the FAQ or in this forum that I could uncover.

So, in playing the scenario... I used the captives influence pool to play cards which felt like the hobbits were still working against the Urik-Hai as in the book. They were unable to do anything else... But could be a target of the Burden - Overcome by Grief... Nothing says it would not be feasible.

Does anyone have another interpretation on how this should be played? I cannot believe the designers left this so open ended. Their running list of FAQ's grows ever longer as they obviously overlook describing fundamental aspects all the time. I wish they would bring in playtesters who are not such fanboys of the product to accurately polish up the text before printing.

And a response today:

 

"The captive heroes do not generate resources. I’m really glad you’re enjoying the quest!

Cheers,
Caleb"

Once again LotR LCG fails to adhere to anything based on the forgone established rules/cards. (Hey, Forest Snare is too good, let's write on every card it is not effected by player's cards going forward?) Nowhere in the rules does it say a hero in play does not generate resources. Based on the fact that the Ring Bearer/Aragorn gain resources when not controlled, it would be the only premise to date that others not controlled also gain resources. Design stated In the core game's Dol Guldur "Prisoners" do not gain resources. Yet, nowhere does it say "Captives" intuitively do not gain resources.

FYI Caleb... Not enjoying your LAME after thoughts. I am still going to enjoy running roughshod on this with Parting Gifts like Saruman, as a designer you clearly need to learn how to better test and write copy rules. Just something else to put into the ever expanding FAQ of this spiraling out of control game. (Yet again reminders of Decipher's Star Wars & Star Trek long gone CCGs.)

Disappointed with their reply... More with us enjoying it!!! Last product I support for them...

If you are quite finished having your temper tantrum.

The Ring Bearer/Fellowship Aragorn are always under one players control (the first player) so not sure what you are referring to exactly as they are always controlled by a player. 
It is however stated that the captives are not controlled by any player. If no one controls them they do not get resources during the resource phase and nothing else specifically mentions that they collect resources so why exactly would they?

And like Grandspleen said even if they WERE generating resources why would you be able to use them if you do not control the captives? 

 

Caleb is awesome and so is anyone else who is or was involved in making this game. Many people play it and although there are rules queries quite often it is in no way spiralling out of control or not well designed. It is a complex game with several variations of play so in depth rules discussion is always going to take place. If you think you can do better then go and do so!

It seems like you have a rather tenuous grasp on the rules as it is so for you to rag on the game developers so hard is ridiculous, the answer was always in front of you, you do not control the heroes so regardless of whether they collect resources or not you cannot use said resources to play cards you control. 

Also it isn't influence it is resources, stop calling it influence it just makes it even more obvious you have no idea what you are talking about. 

Finally if you are really going to stop playing the game because you were wrong about a ruling and can't handle it thats just sad.
