All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.
The last pack has been announced, and with it one of the most versatile cards in the game. Thorongil can be applied in dozens of situations, and here we have a look on which combinations might work, and which don’t. If this is to be the final swan-song of the game, it is a fitting one that lets us re-examine heroes from the first, to the very last.

This is true (and why I said my impression isn't ironclad), but I think it's a mistake to read Caleb's rulings as if they're written in the same legalese dialect that card text is. Caleb is writing in regular, relatively conversational English, with all the imprecisions that that entails.

I believe his intention is more in line with what you also said:

I'd guess that if asked, Caleb would certainly go against LAoM objective heroes as being part of "your collection" for the purpose of Thorongil (and Helm of Secrecy, though it could be argued that "no threat cost" is not the same as zero, so threat isn't actually comparable for that purpose).  So please, no one ask him.  Closing off this fun interaction benefits exactly no one.

When I talk about my LOTR collection I mean *all* of the content, in the absence of additional qualifiers.  LAoM heroes are not part of my player cards, but they unambigiously are heroes in my collection.

It just seems like a small over-sight, but Im sure Caleb did not intend for LaoM heros to be considered part of 'your collection.' They are not player cards

They certainly are not player cards.

They are, however, heroes -- and they are part of my collection.  I agree that Caleb did not *intend* them to be considered Thorongil targets, but treating them as such breaks nothing.
