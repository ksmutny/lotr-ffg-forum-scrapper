I tried to touch upon this in another thread but I am currently so excited about it that I will do so again. How many cycles do you think we shall see before the LotR saga is over? And do you think we shall see any more after that? And what will they be?

 

If we only see one (after Saruman), I am guessing it may well consider the Battles in the North, as that would give more possibilities as far as the geography is concerned (going as South as Lothlórien).

 

Also, will the time-line for any further cycles change? I would think so, with the saga going on in the mean time. I don't think they can really pretend these two things to be independent (within the single game).

 

Any comments appreciated.

i think this is what it comes to- whether you like the idea of going back in time or not after the climax of the saga. personally i think its an unsual thing to do, but i guess perhaps even ffg do not know how long this game will last, so perhaps want to be flexible....or perhaps they wanted to get the saga in now incase sales drop and we are left hanging without ever having gone to mount doom and the lcg (sadly) ends.......i dont know, and i guess only ffg truely knows what influenced their descision..personally ld love another interview with caleb but this time pose some tough questions for him..really get into the engine of this game

 

if, after the last saga pack, we go back to 'preludes' as i can forsee them being commonly referred to from now on, then i would be happy....anything to keep the game going really
