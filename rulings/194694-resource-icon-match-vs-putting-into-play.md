Hi all,

 

It has been a while but I'm really curious to put some new cards in play and I wondered how versatile my decks can be for these cards to enter play. The cards I'm intending to play all have a "put into play" effect. My question can you put the the following cards into play without a resource match?

To clarify, this question is for putting these cards in play by their Action/Response. Not by purchasing them during the planning phase.

 

Gr,

Jban

I e-mailed Caleb about this a few months ago. You don't need a resource match. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Here's his reply:

 

"A resource match is require to play a card, but you do not need a resource match to put a card into play. Therefore, you do not need a resource match to trigger the Response effect on Curious Brandybuck.

Cheers,
Caleb"
