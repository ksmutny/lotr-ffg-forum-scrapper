My recent Gandalf thread got me thinking a bit. And I'm just curious now. Can anybody think of any extremely powerful or even overpowered combo that is not possible now, but would be possible if all those cards of LotR that require printed resource icons were requiring just a resource icon, without being necessarily printed?

We have asked caleb, someone wanted to play it with merry + good meal :

You can't, because the requirement for playing the card is to spend ressource from 3 different heroe's pool. Not less. So if you reduce the cost, you can't play it!

You can fool yourself with leaf brooch on merry ^^ (and secrecy and two other tactics heroes).

Good luck getting secrecy with 3 Tactics heroes.

anyway just wonna the admit now the way of game is going well. Before i was really sceptic but now i see Caleb really make a good job. And most of his idea i agree. With songs to. I think songs was mistake at all!  Spheres should be unique in my opinion only exclude like Elrond or Gandlaf or Herluin is ok. But my experience is limited by 1 or 2 players so maybe in 3 4 payers game songs is much more needed.
