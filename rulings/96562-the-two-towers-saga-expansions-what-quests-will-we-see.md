As the title says, I was wondering what kind of quests we will se in the TTT saga expansions. Since the player has to have a Ring-Bearer as his fourth hero, does that mean we are limited to Frodo/Sam Story-line for these Expansions?

 

It would be somehow a pity, but having a Ring-Bearer Aragorn would disagree too strongly from the lotr theme I think.

 

Did we alreday have any news on this? Or did you already think about it?

We had a thread about the second Fellowship box and so I will take this thread at face value and muse on the first Towers box - especially since I've been thinking about it in light of the new news on the Ringmaker cycle. I am really wondering if they will stick to the exact story line and keep the third box all about Rohan or if they will skip back and forth between Frodo's story and the Rest of the Fellowship's story. I can see arguments for both. There are some great quests possible in Rohan, but are there really three distinct quests possible following Frodo & Sam?

I see the stairs and an epic battle with her ladyship, and journey quest through the dead marshes and down through Ithilien, but then... If they add in Emen Muil (again) will it just seem like more of the same? (I'm sure that Caleb & Co. Have already given this much thought btw.) Incidently, I was expecting that we would see a serious Secrecy boost when we got to this part of the story.

So for the Quests built around book three I expect pursuing the orcs (Three Hunters), Helm's Deep (yes!), and the Ents attacking Isengard. For the latter I expect that we will have to somehow convince the Ents to join our side before we attack Isengard in order to have enough strength to manage.

But again, given the way the timelines in the story work - the battle against Shelob actually occurred at the same time as the siege of Minas Tirith - I think we might see the quests not follow the books exactly. And if you carry the thought process further into The Return of the King, you will see that it makes sense to do this.
