In this series, I will concentrate on certain card design (not art) which I find unfortunate.

 

I will start with two Spirit cards from the core set, Dwarven Tomb and Unexpected Courage. They come to mind quickly when I see two newer cards from the Against the Shadow cycle, Map of Eärnil and Steed of the Mark. And these new cards are what I call "well-designed" but their only problem lies in the cards above which make them bad tactical choices.

 

If you compare Dwarven Tomb to Map of Eärnil, the former is just better. This I could accept in an inter-spheral comparison but not within the sphere. Dwarven Tomb costs what Map of Eärnil does at its best (not taking into considerations wild coop combos like Desperate Alliance). Tomb is also an event which makes it easier to play. And it can recover any Spirit card, not just events. Finally, it can successfully recover response events whilst the Map can only recycle action events.

 

Players with long experience tend to fear power creep. This above is an example of the opposite when there is a new card that is way, way inferior to an old one. Does inferior means better design? I would say so in this case, because the Map is perfectly playable, recycling cards like Elrond's Counsel, The Galadhrim's Greeting or Stand and Fight can be very useful, so there seems little arguing that the Map is not strong enough. And that in itself is a good argument for the Tomb being too strong a card. And the fact it only appears once in the core set is no salvation.

 

The other comparison, Unexpected Courage and Steed of the Mark. This one may be even more extreme. Steed is cheaper by 1 but to use it, you already lose the resource advantage the first time you use it. Then, the use is way more limited, with the Courage a hero can do any two actions, be it quest, combat or ability. With the Steed he can only quest and do one more thing (afterwards). This is already a huge difference but it goes far further. For some reason the much more able card, the Courage, has no restrictions, and can be played on any hero, whilst the Steed can only be attached to Gondor or Rohan heroes.

 

Now, is the Steed good enough? Well it is not an obvious winner but I feel it can be super useful. As they say in the preview, for one resource you make any Gondor or Rohan hero a Core Aragorn, not bad. Plus, soon we might see some Mount synergies coming from the partly Rohan cycle. So where's the problem, you see it, the Courage.

 

Solution? As much as I hate to say this, it is errata. Far less potent cards have got it already, so here's time now for these two. Hope others are with me, and ffg are reading...

 

Wait, to say errata is not enough, right? We need to know how to shaft them. It is not easy but for the Courage, I give two solutions. The first is in accord to what core set card distribution does. Why not print "Limit 1 per deck" on Unexpected Courage. I wouldn't say unique because it doesn't make much sense, thematically, and the designers have been very good with those, maybe save Light of Valinor which also makes little sense being unique (but it helps keep the balance of the power of the card). The other solution could be the cost though I wonder if errata ever goes that way, having a text missing or added is one thing but having something else printed is a bigger problem - unless we finally get the reprint of the cards changed by designers after we had bought them.

 

As for Dwarven Tomb, I think it is even harder here. I wouldn't want this to become another Dwarven synergy card as we have gotten quite too many of those already. Limitation on the cards it pulls could also be a trouble: if it only works for allies, it would be probably inferior to Stand and Fight. However, it could only work for attachments, after all the thematic ground of this card could be the Book of Mazarbul. So yeah, this is where I would go: dig the grave for a Spirit attachment.

 

Please, share your thoughts if you feel like...

I have been around for quite a while and I understand why errata occurs - not just in this game, but in general. The errata that has occurred in this game has been based on issues where combos were broken. Beravor was not intended to be allowed to draw out half the deck in a single round for a big Protector quest play, nor was the zigil dwarf guy intended to rack up a ton of resources for a huge 1-turn trick win option. Errata was necessary on those cards due to the fact that the designers were unable to account for every possible manipulation.

 

What you are asking for is far different. You want older, better cards to be neutered to accomodate weaker design options. As someone who owns three core sets, I don't, and I resent the implication that it's necessary to punish people who want to use 3 copies just because Caleb made a weaker concept in an encounter pack.
