After months of telling myself it's me, I must be doing something wrong, and I just need to be more open-minded as I rethink my strategy, I finally had to admit to myself: I loathe the Heir to Numenor box set. (Sorry Caleb.)

 

Specifically, I can't beat the darn thing no matter what I try. Battle and Siege go completely against the spirit of the game and pigeonhole players into a specific deck concept. There's no room for free thinking with this. I've run Peril into Pelagrir about 10 times with 8-10 different approaches and frankly, nothing has worked. The only other quest that has frustrated me this much is Battle of Laketown.

 

I'm fine with difficult - I prefer a challenge - but these quests just feel wrong. The whole idea is willpower quests, attack is for hitting and defense is for blocking. When you force players to disregard one stat and divide the focus of another, that is just bad design in my opinion.

 

The reason for posting this is to get feedback about how other players are dealing with this box set. I'm definitely open to suggestions. I don't care as much about deck lists as I do about hearing strategies.
