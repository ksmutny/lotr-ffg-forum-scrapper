Did anyone notice!?

With the 5th Dream Chaser pack what are you hoping for in terms of player cards?
What are you hoping for in terms of the scenario? We know it's a sailing scenario again, what else do you want to do on the seas?

> We need more rings in general. For a game called Lord of the Rings, there are far too few rings, especially compared to other Tolkien card games, where they had many Lesser Rings, Dwarven Rings, etc

 

I would bet money Caleb & Matt have considered this and have a rationale for not including them.

I'm sorry Derek, but I respectfully disagree. Having Lesser Rings would "point us towards the events of the text"? And what's wrong with that? How about all the Eagles and Ents we've had in the cycles and not in the sagas, the only time when those factions did anything? Those guys did nothing and stood back during the 17 year gap and yet we can still bring Treebeard to fight at the Fords of Isen or Gwaihir to the Morgul Vale. I'm sorry, but that doesn't convince me. 

 

The whole point of the game is to ask "what if"? "What if Beorn went on the quest?" as Caleb himself says in the Team Covenant Black Riders video. You say Lesser Rings would be too much to handle for the game? I think you're involuntarily insulting the developers with that claim. Of course they could handle it, just like they've handled everything else. You say Artifact related themes should be restricted to Encounter cards? Then Caleb&Matt clearly made a mistake when making The Seeing-Stone and Keys of Orthanc, and the whole Doomed mechanic, because the whole point of that was to slap an Encounter keyword on player cards to represent the shady stuff. We're getting Haradrim allies/heroes next cycle, allies and heroes we could bring to Arnor if we want to. Is it too much of a stretch to think Glorfindel might have had a minor elven ring on his finger during his travels?

 

This game is THE chance for the players and creators to go all out and really explore Middle Earth. Thematic concessions must happen. Sure, we'll hopefully never see something as an Orc hero or ally, but never seeing more Lesser Rings or Palantiri because they're too risky? Come on. The whole point of the game is to encyclopedically explore Middle Earth, and what you're arguing is just restrictive to that goal.

> I see a few reasons, one being the scope of the game. This is about adventures before the War of the Ring, so having lots of Ring cards would pull away from that and point us more towards the events of the text (which are handled via saga) if only in spirit. Also balancing reasons, which have already been cited. The elven rings are super powerful and mostly restricted, as they should be, so those fit -- especially because of the restrictions of particular bearers. The Palantir has a nice "corruption" mechanic. How many more can the game support, if we're talking about the rings of Celebrimbor and Sauron? Using such a thing should be trouble for characters and I just don't see many ways the game can handle that. Play First Age.

> If we're talking more generic rings, made by Men or Dwarves or Silvan elves, then what mechanical effect should they create? It seems like the cheap little bonus cards are already taken by Signals, so that leads us into very specific, "magical" effects, which perhaps seem best reserved for the greater rings that are already in the game. Such effects would take away some of the wonder of the Big Three rings, which are, to me, the capstone of powerful player card artifacts in this setting.

We got a tiny, literal taste of that in the Ring-maker Cycle, and I think a one-off quest where there is some kind of timer showing how this ring you picked up is whittling away at your heroes somehow, is a cool idea.

I totally agree Derek, well said.

We got rings. All three Elven ones and the ring of Barahir. This isn't Dungeons and Dragons, this is The Lord Of The Rings. Just because you want them and the Blue Wizards doesn't mean that you are right and that Matt and Caleb should make it happen. No matter how much you complain about it.

Wow. I appreciate your passion for the game. 

 

Allow me to try and further explain myself: a big "what if" would be "what if they found ring X". That is a topic more worthy of storytelling than a new avenue of mechanical usage. That's my point when I say I think it would better be handled by encounter cards. Rings become less special the more of them they are. 

 

And my short-sightedness or lack of imagination for new game mechanics is not an insult to the devs. Thanks.
