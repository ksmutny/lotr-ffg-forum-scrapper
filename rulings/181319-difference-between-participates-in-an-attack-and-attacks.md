# [Difference between &quot;participates in an attack&quot; and &quot;attacks&quot;?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181319-difference-between-participates-in-an-attack-and-attacks/)

Hi,

Is there a difference between "participates in an attack" and "attacks"?

 

For example:

1) Legolas' text says:

"Response: After Legolas participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, place 2 progress tokens on the current quest."

Do I only get to place a progress token on the current quest if Legolas attacks with at least one other character, or can I also place a progress token on the current quest if he attacks alone?

 

2) Similarly, the Blade of Gondolin says:

"After attached hero attacks and destroys an enemy, place 1 progress token on the current quest."

Do I only get to place a progress token on the current quest if the hero attacks alone, or also if the hero attacks with at least one other character?

 

Thanks in advance for your help!

 

Regards,

 

Agesilaos

It is inconsistent and both wordings are used on several cards.  I've never seen anyone play the wordings differently, but it's possible that we are all wrong (it's happened before).  If you want more clarification, you should send an email to Caleb and post his response here.

Hi all,

thanks for the reply and the discussion. I agree with Teamjinmby and Jnicol that there appears to be an inconsistency/oversight. How do you contact Caleb?

Surely they are the same but you are right it has happened before that we are all wrong. I might send off a question myself.

Hi Gello,
The Response effect on both Legolas and Blade of Gondolin work the same way. It is not necessary for a character equipped with a Blade of Gondolin to attack alone in order to trigger its effect.
Cheers,
Caleb

I would have been very annoyed if Caleb's response had been other than it was. Thanks for the confirmation, Psycho.

> My inexperienced perspective is that the Legolas ability triggers whether he is the initial attacker or not. The Blade of Gondolin ability requires the attached hero to be the initial attacker.

There's no differentiation between the characters participating in the attack.  Caleb (the designer) already provided an answer above confirming that Legolas and Blade of Gondolin function in the same way.

There may be a distinction to be made between "declaring an attack" and "declaring an attacker", i.e., if you participate in an attack via Ranged that another player declared, you did not declare the attack, but you ARE declaring Ranged attacker(s). I think this is part of the issue currently being discussed in the Keywords of Balrog thread: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126466-keywords-of-balrog/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126466-keywords-of-balrog/]

 

I suspect we'll need a Caleb ruling to be sure.

I see.  There certainly may be a distinction between declaring an attack and declaring an attacker (I think there probably is).  I tried seeing if the rules are explicit about this, but I cannot find anything concrete.
