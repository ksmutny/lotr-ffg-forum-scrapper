O - Glorfindel (S) - (Reaaaally wanted to go Beravor here... but let's be honest:  It's Glorfindel's world.  We all just live in it.  For now, he's the "Chuck Norris" of LOTR LCG).

P - Gimli - (who doesn't love a short, furry Revenge Tank!)

Q - Aragorn (Lo) -  (So hard to vote against Thalin, but Strider.. er, Loragorn... is the character that first grabbed my attention as a young reader and got me hooked on all things Tolkien.  Speaking of...  Thalin.  Isn't.  Nuff said.)

R - Pippin (Lo) - (Gonna tab this as my big "upset" choice... started to vote "Kill-them-all" Boromir, but since his sacrifice came for the greater good of defending Pippin anyways, I'll yield to his sacrifice... Besides, I'm uber stoked for all these new Hobbits!  Out with the old, in with the new!)

S - Aragorn (Le) - (I wanna love Imrahil more than I do... but seriously, it's Aragorn.  Although Imrahil's artwork nearly earned an upset pick here for me)

T - Faramir - (chants:  Fara-Mir!  Fara-mir!  Fara-mir!   Fara-mir!  Fara-meeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!!)

U - Legolas - (Elf-on-Elf violence.  Not exactly the kin-slaying here, but still nothing anyone wants to see... Plus Legolas avenges Gloin's... my favorite hero art... loss to Elrohir)

V - Hama - (Now that I've long ago broken my "Eowyn-Habit", I can't go back to her now.  Too risky, now that I've been sober for the better part of a year)

W - Dain - (Nori's win over Dwalin in the first round was a nod to the better threat-reduction mechanic...  But all non-Gimli Dwarves must bow before the uber-king!)

X - Sam Gamgee - (Like Caleb Grace reiterating Tolkien's thoughts:  You begin to realize that the main hero of the story gradually shifts from being Frodo... to being Sam.)

Y - Boromir (Le) - (Hardest vote for me in this round.  Bifur really should have earned my nostalgia vote, since I probably ran him 40% of all my games early on.  But a "double-Boromir-upset" in round two??  Too much to ask for!)

Z - Denethor - (gave Denethor my "superior theme" nod for round one. Thorin gets the nod over him this round for the same reason.)

AA - Glorfindel - (Glorfindel gets my "blindly biased" vote this round for two reasons:  1)  I don't give a **** that Elrond is the better hero... I WANT AN ALL-GLORFINDEL FINAL; and 2) Never been a big Elrond.. the character... fan in the first place.  3)  Glorfindel spanked the Witch King... and Balrogs in his earlier incarnation- cue canon purist arguments now; and 4)  I'm apparently not good at math!)

AB - Bard the Bowman - (actually wanted to vote for Frodo as a 4th Hobbit to set up the possibility of an all-hobbit "Final Four", but since he and Merry are both in this bottom division together, it couldn't happen.  So this is where I'll give my "artwork" vote of the round to Bard. Seriously, Magili has me torn... Half the time I think the art is too "pretty", and even non-elves look like elves.  Then you have those cards that you just sit back and "****"... Bard is that moment for me.  He and Gloin are currently my favorite hero artworks.  Although the new hobbits may end up growing on me to pass them....)

AC - Theodred  - ("Make that money" over "Save that Money"... and I used Theodred so much early on in this game.... had to give him my nostalgia vote this round)

AD - Merry - (Another tough call, as Balin's ability is great.  But Merry's artwork is just fantastic!  And his readying ability for extra attacks???  Just sick!  I am SOOOO pumped to see the inevitable new Eowyn Tactics hero and how she and this Merry will produce amazing combos!)

> "angry bear swings twice" was just a GREAT moment in that video... 1)  Because it was a perfect/hilarious synopsis of that play... and 2) when Caleb said it, it was almost sorta quiet and under his breath.  He wasn't TRYING to make a great quip... it just happened naturally!
