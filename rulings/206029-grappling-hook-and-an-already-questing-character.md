# [Grappling Hook and an already-questing character](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206029-grappling-hook-and-an-already-questing-character/)

Let's say I have Grappling Hook attached to Boromir, and i commit him to the quest regularly. Thus, he's contributing 1 WP.

 

Then, in the action window after staging, I ready Boromir, then try to use Grappling Hook. Which of the following occurs?

 

1. Boromir contributes 3 WP (total) because that's his attack value. (I assume this is the correct answer.)

2. Boromir contributes 4 WP because he contributes 3 WP from Grappling Hook and the 1 WP he was already committing through the normal framework.

3. I'm not allowed to use Grappling Hook because characters can't commit to the quest twice.

4. Something else I didn't think of.

 

Boromir is just an example, of course -- the same question applies in any number of situations.

> edit: yes I know characters are committed "simultaneously."  But it doesn't really matter.  A human being selects characters in a discrete order, in actuality, so what rule is there to stop me from selecting Glorfindel over and over, as long as he is a ready character?  "Aragorn, Theodred, and Glorfindel commit simultaneously to the quest" works equally as well as "Glorfindel, Glorfindel, and Glorfindel commit simultaneously to the quest."

Game: Hey, Player, who you sending on the quest?

Player: Glorfindel, Aragorn, Eowyn, Glorfindel.

Game: ...uh, you just said Glorfindel twice.

Player: Yeah, well, he has Light of Valinor, so he never exhausted. You're lucky I didn't say him 100x.

Game: You're supposed to just give me a list of characters, then I--

Player: That WAS a list.

Game: ...okay, a SET of characters. Like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)]

Player: WTF, Game, why are you making me read about abstract math?

Game: Why are you questing with Glorfindel twice when I already clarified that your characters quest simultaneously?

Player: C'mon, you're so unreasonable. Real human beings can't do anything "simultaneously". I should be able to point at my characters one by one.

Game: I've been letting you slide by on that for a while, but you weren't trying to repeat characters before.

Player: What about Core Aragorn?

Game: Why are you reminding me about that?

Player: Because you're still a jerk, Game. So you're saying I can't double-commit anyone?

Game: Did I say that? Don't put words in my mouth; I didn't say that.

Player: You just did, dude.

Game: No, I didn't. All I'm saying is that you're supposed to give me a set of your characters to quest. Once.

Player: ...I don't see the word "set" anywhere in these rules or clarifications.

Game: It's just a convenient term to get the idea across, since you seem bent on eking out some sort of ridiculous advantage here. I don't even see why you're even trying, since I'm just going to add up the willpower at the end of staging anyway, and I'm sure as hell not going to count Glorfy's willpower twice.

Player: Did you just call ME ridiculous? Do you remember Dreadful Gap? Sleeping Sentry? Shadow cards with Burgle effects? Mumaks? Surge STACKING??

Game: Please stop getting worked up. I'm just some rules and a randomized bunch of cards.

[ACROSS THE ETTENMOORS is released. No one notices anything amiss about Steed of Imladris.]

[THE GREY HAVENS is released.]

Caleb/Matt: Hey, have fun with our new Noldor support! We're sure the # of copies of a card in the discard pile and the phrase "beginning of the phase" won't be ambiguous at all!

Player: ...hey, what's this "Grappling Hook"?

Game: GodDAMMIT.
