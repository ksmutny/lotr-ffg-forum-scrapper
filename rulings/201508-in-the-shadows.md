Due to the new FAQ [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/64/ee/64ee44ca-825d-4c14-b77b-b0ad7581ee31/lotr_faq_18.pdf] (1.55), does In the Shadows [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/In-the-Shadows-TLoS] only affect enemies currently engaged with you, or would enemies you engage after you played the event also get the decreased stats?

 

Also, if the enemy somehow had its engagement cost decreased by an encounter card effect after you played the card (resulting in its engagement cost being equal to or lower than your threat) would the enemy still get the decreased stats?

Did someone ask Caleb about this?

 

There FAQ-entry about Lasting Effects is nice but there are many encounter cards with lasting effects which use the word "currently" and those effects cannot be recalculated.

While player cards never uses currently ...
