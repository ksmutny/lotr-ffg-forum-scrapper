Hi, I am recently having some doubts about the Surge keyword and cards which ask you to find a card in the deck, or discard pile, and reveal it.

The F.A.Q. reads:

According to this, if a card asks me to search for a card either into the encounter deck, or discard pile, and reveal it... (for example Pressing Needs [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Pressing-Needs-TLR] ), if I choose a card from the discard pile, and I reveal it, I will ignore any Surge, or Doomed keywords on it, as it is being revealed from the discard pile and not the encounter deck?

From Caleb:

So yes, a card from the encounter discard pile that gets "revealed" triggers Surge, Doomed, and any other keywords related to being revealed.

Hello. Response from Caleb:

 

Hi Javier,
The entry in the FAQ was originally meant to address the question of whether or not players should resolve those keywords if the card they appear on was revealed during Setup. The language “from the encounter deck” is extraneous and should not be viewed as a limitation to the keywords. You should resolve encounter keywords any time they appear on a card that is revealed, regardless of where it was revealed from.
Cheers,
Caleb
