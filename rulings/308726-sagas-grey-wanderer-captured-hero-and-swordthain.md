# [Sagas + Grey Wanderer + captured Hero and Swordthain](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308726-sagas-grey-wanderer-captured-hero-and-swordthain/)

Interesting rules question, taking my Grey Wanderer through the Sagas and I just finished Breaking of the Fellowship. I had a Sword-thain attachment on Gildor,  since he has Sword-Thain attached does he count as a hero and can be captured? And if so does he become the hero version next quest?

If I didn’t have a Sword Thain, would I lose my only hero Haldir? And could I then still continue onto the next quest with a different chosen hero having to take the threat raise? 

And last question, what if your grey Wanderer is Aragorn, does this campaign resolution whiff and do nothing against you?

Question 1 -- At the end of Breaking of the Fellowship Gildor is clearly a hero and thus can technically be chosen.  And since the campaign text for Uruk-Hai says to use that captive instead, you should follow that direction.  Does that mean you can substitute the hero version?  There is no provision I see in the campaign rules, outside of the breaks where you can alter the hero lineup freely, to ever *add* a hero, with the exception of the post text for Uruk-Hai, which instructs you to remove a hero if you have four heroes (another instruction that meshes poorly with a contract).  Substitute yes, add no.  It's not clear, to me at least, whether you could add another player to a campaign) although thematically, that's really what you should do for Road Darkens, then split the two players for Frodo and Aragorn paths.

Thematically, if Gildor was captured, then Gildor should be rescued -- but substituting the hero version instead of using the ally version seems a bit wonky since the (sword-thained) ally is what was captured, and the ally version is just as capable of mechanically interacting with the quest (by being Grishnakh-damaged) as a hero would be.  But when rescued, he would still be any ally.  However, if you were on your second Grey Wanderer, you could revive a fallen Grey Wanderer and now have two heroes active on your campaign log.

Question 2 -- without a sword-thain only Haldir could be captured, and there's no provision that I can see anywhere to add a hero to replace a captive hero, who is still in play, sort of.  But I think you'd be thematically justified in using and applying the Grey Wanderer contract to fellowship Aragorn.

Question 3 -- if your Grey Wanderer is Aragorn you would have to replace him, whether he is the captive or not.  Aragorn can't be the captive either, or you immediately lose.  So even if your lone hero was Aragorn and he was the designated captive, I think you'd replace Aragorn with somebody, then have that somebody be the captive, using Grey Wanderer on the new hero.

Of course, if you're following Caleb's ridiculous moving of setup effects like contracts to *after* encounter setup, you can't play Grey Wanderer at all with one-deck solo, because you control more than one hero already.  You could do it multiplayer as long as you're not first player.
