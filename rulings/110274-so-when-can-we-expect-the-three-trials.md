Would my hope be shattered if I'll assume that it'll be out before the end of July?

From the spoiler article:

 

> Finally, The Three Trials introduces a new Spirit hero, as well as three copies of each player card. Fans of Middle-earth’s Elves will be pleased to find two new Elven allies, one Noldor and one Silvan, as well as events and attachments that promote the cycle’s new Silvan subthemes. You’ll also find a handful of cards that further support the game’s Secrecy keyword and decks that can keep their Threat at twenty or lower.



Only 1 Silvan ally :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

> As part of The Ring-maker cycle, The Three Trials doesn’t focus too heavily on any one player theme. While it lends greater strength to the Silvan mechanics that lead developer Caleb Grace outlined in his introduction to the cycle, the Adventure Pack also supports a wide range of player themes and mechanics that include the Noldor, Dúnedain, and Scout traits; increased interaction for multiplayer games; and the popular Secrecy mechanic that rewards players who can keep their Threat at or below twenty.



Not sure about Dunedain allies, but there will certainly be something for Dunedain. Also I really wonder what the card(s) for the Scout trait will do. We have several Scout allies, some of which aren't played often; giving a good attachment/event for them could bring them out of binders.

As for Rumil, I honestly can't read that number. I can guarantee it's not #50 because that number is given to Spirit of the Wild in the spoiler for The Tree Trials.:

He could potentially come out this pack. We know he's not coming out in Trouble in Tharbad because we already have a Tactics ally spoiled there (though the trend could change to allow 2 allies in the same sphere in one pack). He could also come out in The Nin-in-Eilph or Celebrimbor's Secret, though it certainly looks like he has a 2-digit number, so it is likely either The Three Trials or The Nin-in-Eilph.

Ooooo one noldor ally as well!!! Forgot about that! Very exciting considering most of the older and more revered Elves (most of the powerful ones too!) are Noldor (Elrond, Gildor, Glorfindel, Elladan and Elrohir, Arwen, Erestor, Imladris Stargazer etc).

Ah nice the unique scout attachment is gonna be in this AP as well.

Well, if that is true I find it pretty surprising.

I know in my store it has dropped to a mere trickle over the last year or so. (Though there has been a surge recently with the introduction of our custom rules on game days) As has the advertising packets that FFG send me. As for the dev thing, it is no secret.. just look at the designers. FFG like most companies like this have "star designers" and new commers and upcoming.. all the stars have been moved to other projects. FACT. That is to not say Caleb is not doing a fine job, in fact I think the latest sets are looking extremely good, but he got the job for a reason. Also as to the release thing.. no.. it is not the same for all games. Netrunner is release on the dot every time, as are many of the FFG products. If you do not believe this, just look at the release feed.

Still your right, this is a supposition from me. Still I find it hard to believe anyone who is impartial could possible think this game is just as popular now as it once was.
