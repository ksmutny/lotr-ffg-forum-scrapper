My pack came today. 👏

I've had a quick look at the quest and a friend sent me a screen shot of someone frustrated with the shennenigens in this quest. Looks like the player deck is your  dwindling resources/supplies. The encounter deck is going to make you discard cards like crazy. The quest cards do this based on side quests in play. I haven't looked at any other encounter cards yet. 

I'm guessing a dwarven deck that triggers off discarding cards would work well here, but not the dwarven tropes that actually do the discarding. 

Discard pile cards would shine such as Spirit ally Glorfindel. Stand and fight, reforged, Caldara Galadhrim Weaver, knight of Belfalas, Elven-light, Will of the West. Dwarven Tomb. (A lot of Spirit cards) 

Cards that reorder the top of the deck. Might be useful to make sure you only draw what's essential. Cards that search and pull. So many cards across all spheres. 

And of course side quest loving cards like East Road Ranger, Thallion, legacy blade etc. 

So, I think I might build a Spirit Dwarven Deck. 

Before I dive in what are your thoughts about this quest?

Just found out that my wins are tainted. Apparently, the new Setup rulings mean that you do the Ash Mountain's discard from your deck effect before your resolve player setup cards. Which means that the One Ring and it's Mastery card could potentially get discarded before the ring comes into play.

Which is a ruling that I'm not a fan of, but apparently it exists. So there's no way to reduce the number of cards you discard from your deck by using player setup effects (unless Caleb revisits the ruling in the future and reverses it).

If you follow the latest rulings just hope to not draw Inner Strenght in your starting hand cause you would search for it at the last Step of Setup (after the quest Setup instructions), if you go by "common sense" you would simply add it to your hand before drawing the starting hand. Let's hope Caleb will reverse his ruling.

In the particular case of this quest, just hope you don't discard Inner Strength in the quest Setup...
