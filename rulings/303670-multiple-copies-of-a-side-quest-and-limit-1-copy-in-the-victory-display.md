Some sidequests have "Limit 1 Copy in the Victory Display" but what happens if each player plays one?  Can you still complete both sidequests but then the second just goes to its owner's discard pile?

I didn't search out the ruling, but I believe Caleb did issue one saying basically what you posit.
