I've been thinking about including Expert Trackers in my decks but am somewhat reluctant.

Has anyone else used this card as of yet and if so how useful has it been?

Also because of the way it is worded can you exhaust a scout or ranger character belonging to any player/deck or only one that is controlled by the cards owner?

It is annoying that wording on cards differs and is not consistent however I messaged Caleb and then realised when he replied it is indeed outlined in the core set rules booklet so is pretty clear:

"Many cards are written in a “pay or exhaust X to do Y” manner. When confronted with such a construct, everything before the word “to” is considered the cost, and everything after the word “to” is considered an effect. Costs can only be payed with cards or resources that a player controls. If an effect is canceled, the cost is still considered to have been paid."

(taken directly from core set rulebook under "paying costs")

 

Caleb's response:

Hi Gello,

You can only exhaust characters you control to pay the cost for an event you play.
Cheers,
Caleb
