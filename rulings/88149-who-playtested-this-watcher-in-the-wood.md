I know there has been a lot made of how difficult Into Ithilian is but out of all the difficult cards in this encounter set... one stands out to me.

Watcher In the wood

How did this card make it through playtesting? With four players this card is non functional. In a normal game with four players at full swing you are looking at everyone raising their threat by anywhere from twelve to thirty points easy. Compare that to a single player effect of raising from three to maybe seven.

The game is supposed to be relatively scaleable. What happened here? With an average threat loss of close to twenty points that's. Instant loss everytime the card is drawn

> After we play quests like this and Druadan Forest we highly doubt they playtested this with 4 players, unless they were using some cards that have yet to be released when they did.

 

yes, it's already been stated in interviews that the quests get tested with all of the player cards in a cycle - but i believe caleb said he also tests with core set + deluxe only, as well.

thanks ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] . to comment directly on the need for errata, i think that perhaps, if you feel it really does need it, you should perhaps contact caleb and request some sort of scaling for 4 player. to refer back to my point about play testing, i cant say what ffg actually does, but im guessing 4 player gets tested least of all (may be wrong there but it sort of makes sense with the troubles it must raise)....therefore perhaps the designers just dont know about its problems.

 

i may give this a go 4 handed (though its tough with all the cards) as i want to see first hand how this plays out
