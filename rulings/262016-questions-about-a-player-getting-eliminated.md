Questions about multiplayer mode:

 

1) What happens if a player dies (either by threat or all heroes dead) in quests with separate stage areas, like in Escape from Mount Gram (during quest 2B, before joining any player)? Where do the encounter cards from that player go?

 

2) What happens when a player dies (either by threat or all heroes dead) and is in control of an objective-ally, like Amarthiúl or Iârion, who have the text: "If Amarthiúl/Iârion leaves play, the players lose the game."? Is it insta-lose, or does the objective-ally pass under the control of someone else?

"Hi Rajam,
If a player is eliminated while at his own stage, each encounter card at that stage is discarded and the stage removed from the game.
Cheers,
