I'm not an employee of FFG but if you look on the reddit Lotr forum, there is a recent interview with Caleb where he makes it clear that no one is working on the game and haven't been for a while. There may still be something to come that he completed before he finished, but I think we can assume that this is pretty much it.

Got my copy last week and decided to put my thoughts on it in an article. Here you go: https://visionofthepalantir.com/2020/12/20/first-impressions-the-hunt-for-the-dreadnaught/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2020/12/20/first-impressions-the-hunt-for-the-dreadnaught/]

Overall, I am very pleased with the quest, and feel that it is also quite new-player friendly compared to the other POD stuff. The quality of the cards is a lot better than the other POD products, and the fact that Caleb snuck in a contract at all is worth praise. 
I have also played a 13-player game this weekend where we took on the Dreadnaught across 4 tables. For the video of my table, see this replay on the brand new VotP youtube channel:
