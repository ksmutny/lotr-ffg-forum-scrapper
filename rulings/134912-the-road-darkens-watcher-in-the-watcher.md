Hi Guys

 

I finally got my hands on the newest saga expansion (The Road Darkens) and played to first quest today. I managed it quite well I think, but I was not sure how to handle the Watcher in the Water correctly.

 

It's in the staging area, but considered to be engaged with each player. I have two questions regarding this:

 

1) How many attacks does the Watcher make? I decided he would attack each player once, since is engaged to both. Is that correct?

2) How many Shadow Cards does the Watcher get? I assumed one at the beginning of the combat phase that is then valid for both attacks.

3) Can I attack the Watcher normally? He is considered to be engaged, but still he is in the staging area. This confused me a bit, but I assumed I get to attack him normally as he is engaged with me.

 

Would be happy to get some clarification on these points! Thanks in advance :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Best regards

This would then also apply to Durins Bane in Shadow and Flame. My playmate said this and I was like no.. But the seed of doubt was planted..

You could sent an email to Caleb if nobody knows a ruling.
