Look what I wrote below amid the Second Thoughts for Ingold (near the top of the page).

Of course, the designer had thought of it before, it just feels "interesting" to have an idea for a card, and then see it coming: less then a fortnight apart.

 

By the way, I had thought the attachment could be a bit cheaper but I think it is about right. If you play it early, or with a discount, the cost should pay off eventually. However, I do think you need a specific deck to make Sword-thain effective: just as those mentioned in the article or on the forum. Igold himself can get a little stronger with it.

I sent some questions to Caleb regarding this card. I forgot the sneak attack one though, which actually is kind of puzzling. I know for a fact Landroval doesn't work, because when the ally turned hero is destroyed, it immediately becomes an ally again, so it can't trigger Landroval's response.

So here's all the questions I asked for those curious or wanting exact wording:

 

Hey Caleb, one more question about Sword-Thain: if you were to put an ally into play during your planning phase, and then play Sword-Thain on it, would it still return to your hand at the end of the phase, since Sneak Attack specifies "if that ALLY is still in play return it to your hand?"

 

Great question. If you use Sneak Attack to put an enemy into play, and then play Sword-thain on that ally, that ally would not be returned to your hand at the end of the phase because it would no longer be an ally.
Cheers,
Caleb

 

Hello! So I was just reading on the forums about the newly spoiled Sword-Thain card, and a question came up about what happens when the ally become hero has card text that refers to returning them to a player's hand or deck, as heroes cannot do this. For example, is ally Beorn able to use his ability and not get shuffled back into the player's deck?

 

The Golden Rule for the game requires that a hero Beorn must be returned to your hand if you trigger his Action while Sword Thain attached. The text on the card still super-cedes the rules for the game.

Cheers,
Caleb

 

In a similar vein, how does Landroval work with this new card? If it is placed on him, I wouldn't think he could activate his ability if he were destroyed, but if another ally with this attachment is destroyed, can Landroval save them? Or have they already lost the hero distinction and been rendered an invalid target?

 

Landroval’s Response triggers “After a hero card is destroyed…” An ally with Sword-thain attached will lose the hero card type after it is destroyed and Sword-thain is discarded. That means at the moment Landroval can trigger his effect, the ally would no longer be a valid target.

 

Also Mirlonde's ability wouldn't do anything to the threat cost of the ally with Sword-Thain on it, since its threat cost is 0 and it cannot be lowered below that. Returning to starting threat with Aragorn would still be back to 18.

Oh, full disclaimer, I did not ask that one to Caleb, there's just no doubt in my mind that's how it works.
