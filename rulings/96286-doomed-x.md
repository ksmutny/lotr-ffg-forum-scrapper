Will the abilities of the allies that are connected to Doom x trigger from revealed cards in the encounter deck or just player cards that have the keyword?

I followed up on this just in case, so I had to ask. Here is the answer.

If you raise your threat for the doomed keyword, whether from a player card or encounter card, you have still raised your threat for the doomed keyword. Thus any effect that triggers "after you raise your threat from the doomed keyword" will trigger, regardless of the source of the doomed keyword.

Cheers,
