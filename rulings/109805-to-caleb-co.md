Dear designers, FFG,

 

I am asking you to reconsider the errata considering Master of Lore, a Lore sphere ally originally designed for Heirs of Númenor. As a veteran player (since the core set), it would be hard for me to count the number of cards that have higher effect on the game than this one. Indeed it is very difficult to understand that Unexpected Courage or Gandalf from the core set still reign free whilst this scholar is getting the shaft.

 

I believe the errata was a reaction to the Master of Lore - Horn of Gondor - Erebor Hammersmith - Borne Aloft combo. Out of curiosity I have tried such a deck at the time and I can honestly say it was the most tedious, least thematic deck with a low chance of beating the harder quests. The combo of four different cards not only takes 12 slots of your deck right away but since you want to have it working as early as possible, more cards fuel that engine and do nothing else. Any quest that is tough on players from the start shall dismantle this naiveté. And the more you invest into setting the combo up, the less reward you get once it is set -- you still need resources to pay for the cards, and even Protector of Lórien cannot help you with all your accumulated trouble; and it would be (again) easier to put Will of the West on the black list.

 

More so, if the loop is needed to be stopped no matter what, then Master of Lore should probably be the last to be punished. Why not simply give Erebor Hammersmith limit once per round -- a limit we can see on the new events like Swift and Silent, and a limit which will otherwise not harm the Dwarven ally at all.

 

It seems obvious the designers have been careful with the errata and in general used it only against the obvious offenders like the ever greedy Zigil Miner. But, for some reason, Master of Lore is the one shiny exception to the trend, and his errata version is hardly usable.

 

I am hoping other players will support this notion, which could result in a simple thing: we all shall have one more card to consider when building a deck, especially the mono-Lore which was one of the pursuits of the Against the Shadow cycle at the beginning of which Master of Lore arrived.

 

Thanks for reading!

A thread intended to be read by Caleb & Co is now becoming an exemple of how Sauron is winning over the people of the forum. Did someone gave you a ring recently ?
