With the announcement that CoC LCG is going away - how much life do you think is left in LOTR? My wife and I are always looking for good co-op games (FFG delivers on many levels) and we just took the plunge into LOTR and are loving it!

 

That being said: how much time do you *think* we have left in these cycles?

LOTR LCG is an FFG best seller. Caleb and Matt have done an awesome job with the game, and the player base seems quite loyal and growing. This game is one of FFG's top products; they are not going to stop it any time soon.
