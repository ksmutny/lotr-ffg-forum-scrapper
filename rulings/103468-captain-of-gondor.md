That was a really great article overall.  Always cool to hear Caleb's insight and i think i speak for most of us that this game has a really exciting future in his hands.  This may seem overly cliche but he just "gets it".  We want theme, we want good player cards, we want trait support but we also want the spheres to retain their importance.  It seems he's accomplishing all of this splendidly

What do you think the other attachments are going to do?...

Caleb mentioned ones for Scout, Noble, and Ranger

I'm just happy to see Caleb & Co filling in some of the gaps left before them: hero traits, secrecy, elves. All the traits getting support In this cycle feels like a real attempt at them shoring them things up.

 

The article itself, and Captain of Gondor, were great too. Our game is in good hands!

I'll reiterate my support for Caleb & Co.  The game is very complex and must walk a fine line due to its mechanics, theme and community - as the article spells out well.  Brilliant job so far, guys!  

 

You have my vote to head up design when it comes to the Silmarillion game.   ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
