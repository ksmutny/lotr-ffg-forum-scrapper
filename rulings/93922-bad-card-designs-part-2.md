Caleb has just written in the preview that he likes to read what people think about his efforts: the feedback naturally wanted in any enterprise. Well, I think he can be pleased with the reaction to the just concluding cycle, the consensus tends to be it has been the best cycle yet.

 

At the same time, I do not think there has ever been such a unanimous negative reaction to anything in the game as there is now to the Outlands faction. For most of the players, this is an utter miss. And the only argument there seems to be for them is the fact that they can help new players be introduced to the game. I would argue against it, yes, it can help them win straight away but it might still feel strange and will not teach them to play in any good way, it will do the exact opposite, I feel, it will just show them some obvious moves which do no correspond with how the game usually runs (with more interesting decks).

 

So I am really curious what shall be done about the Outlands. And before the yells begin, I am not talking about errata, or leastways I do not even believe it might be that very helpful. For myself I actually got so tired with the trait that I might not pick them up even if they are shafted. And I cannot really see how they could be, though I feel the three most obvious cards that would need to be shafted are Herdsman, Men of the West - as two incredible safety cushions, and Lord of Morthond as a cheap draw engine.

 

For me the disappointment is ever so bitter because of how I had been looking forward to them when Hunter of Lamedon appeared in HoN. He seemed perfect then, I especially liked him being double-traited. But it went as we now know, and it may be a great lesson for the designers to learn. But for now I feel bad having some 28 cards in my box that shall never see the light of game.

I honestly cannot connect with the reason why people hate Outlands.

 

People say they are boring to deck build with, but there are plenty of variety.

Hirluin and Elrond seems to be such an obvious choices, but the other 2 heroes makes enough difference to deploy different strategy.

 

People say that Outlands are too strong, but it's not like Outlands let's you play 'faster' compared to other decks.

Sure they are pretty strong when you get enough allies out, but once you survive initial onslaughter of encounter deck and have about 6 ~ 16 allies in play, any deck should become a powerhouse.

 

Men of West? Lord of Morthond? These are more like mono-sphere boosters than Outlands booster for without them, mono-leadership Outlands would be much worse than other archetype for Outlands, nor do those cards make mono-leadership Outlands more powerful than other archetypes.

 

Also you don't need to use them all or none at all. Except for Forlong and lore outlanders, Outlands allies are also great addition to any existing decks.

 

Steward's Fear being an excellent gateway for newer players is an icing on top.

There absolutely have to be a pack that a new player can pick up and have chance of building half decent deck or else this game will die out early.

 

For example, in one of team covnent's videos, Caleb and Matt are aware of Steed of Mark being inferior to Unexpected Courage in many ways, but hints that since Steed has mount trait, there is a good chance the Mark will eventually recieve some sort of buff from other cards.

 

Let's say that became true in next Cycle.

For us old fans with all the expansions this is a good news; previously shafted card became competetive without having to go through errata. Yay!

Mount decks became so hot (since they would be latest power deck and people seems to love the idea of mounts) everyone on the forum is talking about the Mount decks.

 

Let's say a new player who wants to dive into the game and would also like to try out the latest hot deck, they would need Core Set, Voice of Isengard Delux, whatever packs containing Mount cards in that Cycle (probably 4 or more seeing as how other traits were spread), the packs containing Mounts from previous Cycles (1 from AtS and 1 from Dwarrowdelf), and unless they also buy Delux expansions of those Cycles, the quest from those 2 packs are useless.

 

And similar situation holds true for other powerful deck types (for example Dwarf decks are spread between 2 Cycles and 2 Saga Expansions).

So without a single pack containing self-sustainable 'decent' deck, new players have less reason to get into this awsome game; you buy latest expansions, only to find out your deck cannot even beat easy mode, complain on the forum and all the replies say 'it's not that impossible, just go back and buy old adventure packs', realize you need to buy couple packs from this Cycle and couple packs from that cycle, then find out half of the contents of the old adventure packs you bought are useless without their corresponding Delux Cycle...... unless you are patient enough to start from beginning and slowly work you way up, why would anyone spend that much money to try and get into a game he/she isn't sure if they will love?

 

I probably sound like a broken record at this point, but buff underdog cards using traits, give what initially appears to be simple, powerful decks in first adventure pack (or delux expansion) of new Cycle, and have a second deck type get slowly built over the adventure packs. Rather than nerfing Outlands, buff existing traits to a similar powerlevel of Outlands / Dwarf / Noldor.

 

Edit: I think people hate the idea of Outlands, not because of Outlands themselves but happening around the same time.

- People were expecting Gondor traits to be buffed, and was excited how their Guards of Citedel will finally see some play time, but after initial exciting Gondor cards at Heirs of Numenor delux, Gondor cards we got in the actual Cycle were too few and too weak. Visionary Leader may fix this, but it came out little too late and publicity is already made that Outlands trait 'stole' spotlight that should've been on Gondor trait.

- Although mono sphere is great in multiplayers and in select scenarios, they were not the kind of card people are excited to add to their deck. Most cards we got out of this Cycle holds promising future, but their current form is absolute disappointment compared cards we have already. We got new quests to test our decks against, but it felt like we got no cards to add to our existing decks... except for those darn Outlands that stole Gondor's glory. People probably know that Outland is just a word for Gondorians who are residing outside of central area (Anorien, Osgiliath, Ithilien), but that doesn't really do anything to change their mind.

- Iconic characters were 'ruined'. Denethor ally card is okay when you take a second look at it, but it doesn't live up to the name Denethor. I can see why they did it, I can see how he might be useful, but no way that card deserved to be called Denethor. Faramir card is okay, but for some reason developers didn't give us a chance to use him. Why would you release such an iconic hero that everyone was looking forward to then make him literally unplayable in the climatic adventure packs to follow?

About Outlands. If you play a Nightmare mode they are ok for solo.

but un 2 or 3 players game regarding a nightmare or normal they are broken.

So I also hate them and believe we dont need cards like this .

about erattas. Erratas and times to times rules corrections is a part if this kind of games.

Since game is very complex and new cards all the time coming without corrections and some cards erratas game cannot be healthy. Is a matter of fact nothing alse. Caleb is trying to do his best for that. I cannot say he us brilliant but his on his way and maybe un the end of the day he will make it.

I again agree with you Glaurung, I think Caleb is on his way, and he seems to be very careful about his choices; these many-coloured guys seem to be the only real miss he has done with the cycle.

I'm not sure how much Caleb had control over the Against the Shadow cycle. I think I remember reading that the Hobbit and Black Riders saga boxes were the first ones he's had full control over...
