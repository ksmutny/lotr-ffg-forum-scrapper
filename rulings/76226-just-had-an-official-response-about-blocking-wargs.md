I submitted a question to Caleb Grace asking what happens if the last card (or the last two cards) of the scenario deck are both cards with Surge that are shuffled back into the deck once they've been resolved.  This was the response I got:

"In the rare event that Blocking Wargs is revealed as the last 1 or 2 cards in the encounter deck, it creates an infinite loop. Should this happen, the players will have to reset."

 

 

Given that there are 4 copies of Blocking Wargs and two copies of another treachery card that is shuffled back into the deck and all have Surge, I'm not entirely sure that it's far to say this is a "rare event" (it's happened to me twice already), and I REALLY don't like the idea that it effectively results in an automatic loss (or as near as dammit) and you have to restart.

 

 

Thoughts?  Comments?  Opinions?

I think the answer is quite odd but im ok with that cose Caleb is much better for the game then Previous guy ( Nate) so give him a chance.

HON and Hobbit is cool anyway so i think he will solve all mistakes step by step.

Had a follow up response to my reply to the first one:

"The situation you are describing is the unintentional byproduct of an ambitious design. I call it rare because in all of the extensive playtesting that was done by the design team in the office and by our external playtesters, this situation never happened. I can assure you that we playtested this scenario far more than six times and if this situation had occurred during one of those times we would have addressed it then. The best we can do now is suggest that players reset. When we release our next FAQ for the game, we can address the infinite loop with a possible errata at that time."



 

4 / 35 chance of Warg trechery being last card of the encounter deck.
That is roughly 1 in every 7 game.
Of course there must be some cases where it was dealt as shadow card, or players didn't run out of encounter deck, etc.
but once again, FFG might want to get some more budget into play testing

 

On the other hand, I hope that Caleb does not stop being ambitious with the design of this game, because infinite loop of Warg trechery cards is really small oversight compared to overall improvement of this cardgame with Heirs of Numenor expansion.

 

But yeah… FFG should look into that play testing thing. Change the way how internal play testing works or hire more play testers or release beta version to exclusive members before actual product……

I mean, I won't even mind waiting extra few weeks (or a month or two), if that will help improve overall quality of the game.
Better delayed to perfection than rushed goods.
