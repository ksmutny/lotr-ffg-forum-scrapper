For some reason, FFG did not see fit to bestow this forum with an Official Rulings thread (like they did, say, here: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277422-legend-of-the-five-rings-official-rulings/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277422-legend-of-the-five-rings-official-rulings/),]), so I thought it might be useful to have an unofficial one for random little rulings that might not deserve an entire dedicated thread.

(I encourage people to start a new thread if you do indeed want to discuss a specific ruling posted here, just to keep this thread clean.)

Resurrecting this idea…

It's the same as when an enemy in the staging area is "considered to be engaged" with you but it has not actually engaged you. So, I'm afraid Thror's Key will not help you in Temple of the Deceived.

Blast from the past this time... I'm sure you've gotten this question quite a bit. Wargs (OG Wargs, that is) have the text "Forced: "If Wargs is dealt a shadow card with no effect, return Wargs to the staging area after it attacks." (Very similar wording crops up on Lord Alcaron in his enemy form.)

 1. Does "a shadow card with no effect" merely refer to the existence of text that says "Shadow: ___" on the card, or does it refer to the possibility of the effect changing the game state? e.g., in Conflict at the Carrock, Wargs could get Roasted Slowly as a shadow card, whose shadow effect is "Shadow: If attacking enemy is a Troll, remove 2 damage tokens from it." Does this count as a shadow card WITH an effect, thus keeping the Wargs engaged?
 2. Barring considerations such as #1, if you cancel the shadow card's effect with Hasty Stroke or whatnot, do the Wargs return to the staging area?
 3. If you discard the shadow card before it ever resolves, and it turns out that shadow card had no shadow effect, do the Wargs return to the staging area?

A question about stacking Doomed... You're playing Massing at Osgiliath and haven't crossed the Anduin. You're sitting at 30 threat with a ready Elfhelm ally out. During staging, you flop two consecutive copies of Massing at Osgiliath, then an arbitrary enemy. That 2nd copy of Massing has gained Doomed 1 [threat now 31], at which point Elfhelm says "Nope!" [30]. So far, so good. How about that last enemy? Either: The enemy has gained a total of Doomed 2; that hits [32], and Elfhelm triggers [31]. Or: The enemy has gained "Doomed 1, Doomed 1"; the first Doomed hits [31], and Elfhelm triggers [30]; then the second Doomed hits [31], and Elfhelm triggers [30]. Different outcomes. Which one actually happens? (A similar question might be generated for stacked Toughness.)

Haradrim Elite says: "Forced: When Haradrim Elite enters play, it makes an immediate attack from the staging area against the first player." What if you pull one of these guys with a Dunedain Hunter or the new Wait No Longer? Is he engaged with you when he makes his attack against the 1st player? Or in the staging area? Both? Does he make his attack at all?

> Quote
> 
> Haradrim Elite was written to explain its effect at a time before Dunedain Hunter existed. Around the time that Heirs of Numenor was released, the design team was receiving questions about enemies that made immediate attacks as part of their "when revealed" effects. Players wanted to know: "Does this mean it engages me?" The answer was always: "No, not unless its text says it engages you first." But the questions kept coming, so the Haradrim Elite received an extra bit of text to clarify that it attacked "from the staging area."
> 
> 
> Unfortunately, that bit clarification complicated how it interacts with the player cards you mentioned, but it's really not that bad: the enemy will still make an attack, since it has entered play. It is still engaged with you, since nothing explicitly says to move it anywhere else, but its attack will be considered to come from the staging area.

> 
> The last part is similar to an enemy that is in the staging area but is considered to be engaged with a player. For the duration of the attack, the Haradrim Elite is still engaged with you, but considered to be in the staging area. That may or may not make a difference depending on what card effects are active, but that's how it will resolve.

Can you trigger the Erebor Guard's Response (lowering his cost) if you're playing him off the top of your deck with hero Gandalf? The possible issue is that, even if considered part of your hand, the Erebor Guard is still the top card of the deck, so does triggering his Response discard himself but still work? Does it discard the two cards below him? Can you not trigger it at all? If you CAN trigger it, when do you decide on whether you even want to trigger the Response? Gandalf's passive ability "instantly" turns the top card of your deck faceup, so perhaps I would use that information to decide whether I want to use the Response or not, if the timing allowed for that.

For the instant it takes you to play a card, it is not in your hand or in play - it is being played.

(This one still blows my mind.)

If I reveal In Need of Rest at a time when no heroes are committed to the quest, does the treachery whiff entirely? Or did I still have to attach it to a hero (of my choice)? The "that hero" of the phrasing gives me pause: does it refer to a hero that's been removed from the quest by the first clause of the effect, or to simply "a hero" (with the first clause whiffing but the second clause still able to fire)?

If you use a Scroll of Isildur to play Rumour from the Earth and return the Rumour to your hand, does the Scroll's bottoming ability still apply? i.e., does that ability still have "access" to the hand (a different out-of-play area than the one explicitly referred to on the card, the discard pile)? (This is all assuming you can even return the Rumour to your hand despite it not having originated from there… But I assume this is doable; otherwise, the Silvan bounce effects would be greatly neutered by the fact that Tree People puts Silvans on the board who have never been in your hand.) 

> Quote
> 
> The passive effect created by Scroll of Isildur does not resolve until after you finish resolving the effect of the event you chose to play. That means if you chose to play Rumor from the Earth and pay 1 to return it to your hand, you would then have to place it on the bottom of your deck.

> Gandalf’s ability does not combo with Hirgon or Thranduil because they only target allies in your hand. Gandalf’s ability only makes the top card of your deck count as if it were in your hand at the time that you play it. That means it only works when you would normally play that card. To play an ally with Gandalf’s ability requires you to play it during the planning phase.

(Ouch!)

EDIT: @naverag [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/290622-naverag/] further interprets this ruling thusly, which I thought was well-put: "…Gandalf's ability only modifies the framework effect of playing cards from your hand, whereas Hirgon and Thranduil create non-framework opportunities to play cards from your hand."

So, Wild Stallion is a very cool card. Its new mechanic has brought up a couple of questions:

1. Once you have attached it to an ally, does it retain its Planning Action to enable it to attach to another ally in the future? Or does it lose all of its original abilities, totally replaced by the "Counts as" text?

2. If the ally riding a Stallion leaves play, would Spirit Bard be able to return the Stallion to its owner's hand? Or does it lose the attachment type before that can happen?

> Quote
> 
> 1. It’s planning action is only active while it is an ally. Once you attach it to an ally, then it becomes an attachment and only its attachment text is active. 2. Wild Stallion can be returned to your hand with Bard’s ability because it counts as an attachment at the time you check for his Response.
