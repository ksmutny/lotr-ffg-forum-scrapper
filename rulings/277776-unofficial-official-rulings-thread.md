For some reason, FFG did not see fit to bestow this forum with an Official Rulings thread (like they did, say, here: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277422-legend-of-the-five-rings-official-rulings/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277422-legend-of-the-five-rings-official-rulings/),]), so I thought it might be useful to have an unofficial one for random little rulings that might not deserve an entire dedicated thread.

(I encourage people to start a new thread if you do indeed want to discuss a specific ruling posted here, just to keep this thread clean.)

Blast from the past this time... I'm sure you've gotten this question quite a bit. Wargs (OG Wargs, that is) have the text "Forced: "If Wargs is dealt a shadow card with no effect, return Wargs to the staging area after it attacks." (Very similar wording crops up on Lord Alcaron in his enemy form.)

 1. Does "a shadow card with no effect" merely refer to the existence of text that says "Shadow: ___" on the card, or does it refer to the possibility of the effect changing the game state? e.g., in Conflict at the Carrock, Wargs could get Roasted Slowly as a shadow card, whose shadow effect is "Shadow: If attacking enemy is a Troll, remove 2 damage tokens from it." Does this count as a shadow card WITH an effect, thus keeping the Wargs engaged?
 2. Barring considerations such as #1, if you cancel the shadow card's effect with Hasty Stroke or whatnot, do the Wargs return to the staging area?
 3. If you discard the shadow card before it ever resolves, and it turns out that shadow card had no shadow effect, do the Wargs return to the staging area?

A question about stacking Doomed... You're playing Massing at Osgiliath and haven't crossed the Anduin. You're sitting at 30 threat with a ready Elfhelm ally out. During staging, you flop two consecutive copies of Massing at Osgiliath, then an arbitrary enemy. That 2nd copy of Massing has gained Doomed 1 [threat now 31], at which point Elfhelm says "Nope!" [30]. So far, so good. How about that last enemy? Either: The enemy has gained a total of Doomed 2; that hits [32], and Elfhelm triggers [31]. Or: The enemy has gained "Doomed 1, Doomed 1"; the first Doomed hits [31], and Elfhelm triggers [30]; then the second Doomed hits [31], and Elfhelm triggers [30]. Different outcomes. Which one actually happens? (A similar question might be generated for stacked Toughness.)

> If a card gains two instances of Doomed, then it has Doomed 2. In the situation you described, the enemy revealed would have Doomed 2 forcing you to raise your threat by 2, then Elfhelm would reduce it by 1.

Haradrim Elite says: "Forced: When Haradrim Elite enters play, it makes an immediate attack from the staging area against the first player." What if you pull one of these guys with a Dunedain Hunter or the new Wait No Longer? Is he engaged with you when he makes his attack against the 1st player? Or in the staging area? Both? Does he make his attack at all?

> Quote
> 
> Haradrim Elite was written to explain its effect at a time before Dunedain Hunter existed. Around the time that Heirs of Numenor was released, the design team was receiving questions about enemies that made immediate attacks as part of their "when revealed" effects. Players wanted to know: "Does this mean it engages me?" The answer was always: "No, not unless its text says it engages you first." But the questions kept coming, so the Haradrim Elite received an extra bit of text to clarify that it attacked "from the staging area."
> 
> 
> Unfortunately, that bit clarification complicated how it interacts with the player cards you mentioned, but it's really not that bad: the enemy will still make an attack, since it has entered play. It is still engaged with you, since nothing explicitly says to move it anywhere else, but its attack will be considered to come from the staging area. 
> 
> 
> The last part is similar to an enemy that is in the staging area but is considered to be engaged with a player. For the duration of the attack, the Haradrim Elite is still engaged with you, but considered to be in the staging area. That may or may not make a difference depending on what card effects are active, but that's how it will resolve.

Can you trigger the Erebor Guard's Response (lowering his cost) if you're playing him off the top of your deck with hero Gandalf? The possible issue is that, even if considered part of your hand, the Erebor Guard is still the top card of the deck, so does triggering his Response discard himself but still work? Does it discard the two cards below him? Can you not trigger it at all? If you CAN trigger it, when do you decide on whether you even want to trigger the Response? Gandalf's passive ability "instantly" turns the top card of your deck faceup, so perhaps I would use that information to decide whether I want to use the Response or not, if the timing allowed for that.

> Quote
> 
> Gandalf’s ability lets you play the top card of your deck “as if it was in your hand.” When you play a card from your hand, you place it in front of you and pay its cost before resolving the card. For the instant it takes you to play a card, it is not in your hand or in play - it is being played.

If I reveal In Need of Rest at a time when no heroes are committed to the quest, does the treachery whiff entirely? Or did I still have to attach it to a hero (of my choice)? The "that hero" of the phrasing gives me pause: does it refer to a hero that's been removed from the quest by the first clause of the effect, or to simply "a hero" (with the first clause whiffing but the second clause still able to fire)?

If you use a Scroll of Isildur to play Rumour from the Earth and return the Rumour to your hand, does the Scroll's bottoming ability still apply? i.e., does that ability still have "access" to the hand (a different out-of-play area than the one explicitly referred to on the card, the discard pile)? (This is all assuming you can even return the Rumour to your hand despite it not having originated from there… But I assume this is doable; otherwise, the Silvan bounce effects would be greatly neutered by the fact that Tree People puts Silvans on the board who have never been in your hand.) 

> Quote
> 
> The passive effect created by Scroll of Isildur does not resolve until after you finish resolving the effect of the event you chose to play. That means if you chose to play Rumor from the Earth and pay 1 to return it to your hand, you would then have to place it on the bottom of your deck.

To play an ally with Gandalf’s ability requires you to play it during the planning phase.

(Ouch!)

EDIT: @naverag [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/290622-naverag/] further interprets this ruling thusly, which I thought was well-put: "…Gandalf's ability only modifies the framework effect of playing cards from your hand, whereas Hirgon and Thranduil create non-framework opportunities to play cards from your hand."

So, Wild Stallion is a very cool card. Its new mechanic has brought up a couple of questions:

1. Once you have attached it to an ally, does it retain its Planning Action to enable it to attach to another ally in the future? Or does it lose all of its original abilities, totally replaced by the "Counts as" text?

2. If the ally riding a Stallion leaves play, would Spirit Bard be able to return the Stallion to its owner's hand? Or does it lose the attachment type before that can happen?

> Quote
> 
> 1. It’s planning action is only active while it is an ally. Once you attach it to an ally, then it becomes an attachment and only its attachment text is active. 2. Wild Stallion can be returned to your hand with Bard’s ability because it counts as an attachment at the time you check for his Response.

AFAIK your most recent major ruling on progress placement during quest resolution is the following: "So from now on, the active location must be fully explored before placing any progress on the current quest. That means you will resolve any effects that trigger as a result of the active location being explored before placing any progress on the quest."

What if the current quest changes as a result of exploring the active location? e.g., Quest 1B of The Withered Heath has 6 progress, no Dragon Sign in the victory display but the active location is guarding a Dragon Sign. I successfully quest with a margin of 1 progress above what it takes to explore the active location. If I'm reading it right, your ruling above indicates that I should place the progress that explores the active location—leaving 1 pending—which frees up the Dragon Sign, which goes to the victory display as a constant effect, which lets the constant effect of quest 1B fire, which advances the current quest to quest card 2. I still have 1 progress pending.

Do I place it on quest 2B? Or was it "assigned" to quest 1B, which is no longer around, therefore losing me that progress? Thanks!

> Quote
> 
> Progress is still placed on the active location and the quest simultaneously. What I addressed in my ruling was the order of resolution from that point. In the past, I interpreted the rules very strictly as written by insisting that if there was enough progress on the quest to advance that players should do that before resolving anything to do with exploring the active location. That proved to be very unintuitive, so I reversed my ruling to say that players should first resolve any consequences of exploring the active location, and then resolve the progress on the quest. 
> 
> However, since the progress is still placed simultaneously, if exploring the active location should cause you to advance to the next stage, any progress you had placed on the previous stage will be lost.

This is a wild one…

For Lost in the Wild (WoR 26), what happens if you try to...

 * put it into your deck with ally Gildor? (Can a card with an encounter card back enter your deck?)
 * use Message from Elrond to send it to another player? (Does Lost trigger after it has changed hands? For whom? I am thinking of Rider of the Mark here. And at the end of the round, if it's still in hand, is it shuffled into the encounter deck?)

Thanks!

> Quote
> 
> There are currently no rules that prevent you from putting Lost in the Wild into your player deck via Gildor’s ability, or putting it in another player’s hand or deck [sic?] via Message from Elrond. If you did move Lost in the Wild into another player’s hand with Message from Elrond, it would not trigger because it reads “After you play a card…” and it would not be in your hand at that time. It wouldn’t trigger in your teammates hand at that time either because they have not played a card yet.

If I am playing true solo, and Lightless Grotto is the active location with only 1 progress needed to explore it, what happens if I commit to the quest a character holding a Map of Rhovanion? Does the Forced on the Grotto trigger before the Response on the Map? Or are the timing triggers (worded subtly differently) not truly simultaneous?



> Forced effects always resolve before Response effects when they share the same trigger. Since both the Grotto and the Map trigger “after” you commit characters to the quest, you must resolve the Forced effect on the Grotto first.

This one is courtesy of Ian from Tales from the Cards, who asked whether a Keys of Orthanc granted Doomed 1 via Gríma could thus trigger itself…

And this one is courtesy of @Onidsen on the CotR Discord…

Hey Caleb - got a rules question for you: When discarding multiple cards from your deck due to a player card effect like A Very Good Tale or Erebor Soldier, we are instructed to put the cards in the discard pile in the order they are discarded. [Ed.: This ruling is reproduced earlier in this thread.] Based on the Rules Reference guide, this would indicate that the cards are not discarded simultaneously, because cards discarded simultaneously are put into the discard pile in the order a player chooses. This leads to my question.

When using Dwarf Pipe to place a card that I have just discarded from my deck on the bottom of my deck, do I have to make that choice at the moment I discard the card? For example, if I discard 5 cards with A Very Good Tale, do I have to discard the cards one at a time, making the choice whether or not to exhaust the Dwarf Pipe with each card? Or can I discard all 5 cards for A Very Good Tale as a single instance, and then exhaust the Dwarf Pipe to choose one of the cards I just discarded and place it on the bottom of the deck? Thank you for the tireless work you put in on behalf of this amazing game!

-Samuel



> Hi Samuel,
> 
> I would say the correct time to trigger the Response on Dwarf Pipe is immediately after you discard an individual card that you want to put on the bottom of your deck. This is based off the fact that when you discard Mithril Cache or Ered Luin Miner from the top of your deck, you immediately trigger the Response effect before continuing to discard cards.

If an enemy with Followed attached changes engagement from with you to with one of your fellow players, does Followed keep on working, or not? As far as I understand, the owning player retains control of traps he played no matter where they travel around the table (thus the wording of Ambush, to skirt around this), so this is really a question about who the "you" on Followed refers to. Thanks!

> Quote
> 
> Control of Followed does not change when the attached enemy disengages you. The “you” on the card refers to the attachment’s controller. So if the attached enemy engages another player or returns to the staging area, you cannot trigger the effect anymore because it is not engaged with you.

Here's one about Mount Gundabad:

Question:

Hi, In Mount Gundabad, the instructions on the quest cards tell the player to flip from side 2A to side to 2B at the beginning of the quest phase. However, the rules insert says to do that at the beginning of the staging step, under the 'creating the quest deck' section (which parallels what players did in Flight from Moria). Which is correct? Thank you!

Citing this interesting ruling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/262279-another-hideous-timing-question/?tab=comments#comment-3551373], I asked the following about enemies that make immediate Forced attacks after engaging:

ffg_MEC65_35.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_MEC65_35.jpg]

There are two Ravenous Spiders (WoR 35) engaged with other players. I, with my low-threat deck, control an exhausted Sam. During the encounter phase, I play The Hammer-stroke, simultaneously engaging those two Spiders. Now, there are two Forced effects and two occurrences of Sam's Response that all share the same trigger condition. How does this end up playing out? Will I be able to get two defenses out of Sam? Just one defense, with doubly-boosted stats?

> Quote
> 
> The Spiders and Sam share the same trigger condition, but Forced effects always resolve before Response effects. So they do not all trigger at the exact same time. Here’s what will happen when you use Hammer Stroke to engage two Ravenous Spiders at the same time:

He will get the + stats bonus twice because you engaged 2 enemies with engagement cost higher than your threat, but he cannot ready more than once at the same time so the second ready is redundant.

Orcrist and Glamdring have the text "After attached hero destroys an enemy, ...". This is different in wording to all previous similar cards, which either say "After attached hero attacks and destroys an enemy..." or "After attached hero participates in an attack that destroys an enemy...". Does this mean that heroes with the ability to deal non-combat damage - Tactics Bilbo Baggins or Argalad, for example - could trigger the Responses on Orcrist and Glamdring if they destroyed an enemy through that non-combat damage?

I didn't doubt this would be ruled thusly, but I just wanted to nail it down…

You said in a Hirgon/Thranduil ruling that hero Gandalf only makes the top card count as if it were in your hand "at the time you play it". What about immediately after? That is, if using him to play a card off the top of your deck with an "after you play [this] from your hand" ability—e.g., West Road Traveller—can you trigger the ability?

> Quote
> 
> Yes, you can trigger the ability on West Road Traveler and other similarly worded effects when you play them from the top of your deck with Gandalf because you are playing them as if they were in your hand…
> 
> Gandalf’s ability does not add the top card of your deck to your hand, which is why it does not work with cards that specifically target a card in your hand. But he does allow you to play that card as if it was in your hand, which will combo with the cards you mention.

The below set of rulings excerpts were obtained during an exchange between the Cardboard of the Rings hosts and Caleb. They were discussed during their podcast (episode 132, https://cardboardoftherings.com/2018/04/29/episode-132-the-bombur/ [https://cardboardoftherings.com/2018/04/29/episode-132-the-bombur/], around the 35:40 mark).

> Quote

This is consistent with A Game of Thrones where certain effects last “until the end of the challenge.” In that game, if a character is not in a challenge, then he cannot be the target of an effect that lasts until the end of a challenge. Similarly, if you are not in a phase, then you cannot trigger an effect that last until the end of a phase.

This one was shared by Marcelf on the CotR Discord, who asked if (the upcoming) Leadership Frodo's second sentence depended on paying the resource to trigger his 1st effect.

For hardly the first time, I am sympathetic with a @naverag [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/290622-naverag/] take: the "spend 1 resource" is the cost of triggering the Response—this is to be distinguished from the trigger condition of "After Frodo commits to the quest…". So if you do not pay the cost, you don't get to trigger any of the Response, in particular the 2nd sentence.

A similar situation is seen with Gúthwinë's "After attached hero is declared as an attacker, exhaust Gúthwinë to give that hero +2 Attack for this attack. If this attack destroys an enemy, return a Rohan ally from your discard pile to your hand."

This was shared on the CotR Discord back in 10/2017, but I'm not certain the text has ever been recorded here:

Was I correct in assuming that you could stack Hirgon's ability with Theoden's to play a 2 cost ally for free? (By applying Hirgon's minimum 1 ability first, followed by Theoden's passive minimum 0 ability)?

I asked a question about when a quest is considered "defeated" for the purposes of a card like The Road Goes Ever On: Is a quest card considered 'defeated' if no progress tokens are involved in advancing to the next stage of the quest? (Advancing via an effect printed on the quest card instead)... examples I include advancement when no enemies are in play during Into the Pit 2B, and all of the quest cards in Fate of Wilderland. 

And the response:

> A quest is defeated when it has progress equal to its quest points. If a quest has game text that says “this stage cannot be defeated unless…” then that stage is defeated when it has no progress remaining and that condition is met.

Here's an intriguing one courtesy of @Jekzer [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/168482-jekzer/]:

mec77_card_faramir.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/dc/81/dc81df79-88c0-4c27-baa5-0fb4ccd863ca/mec77_card_faramir.png]

I have a question regarding the new spoiled Faramir (A Shadow in the East): if there's a trap unattached on my play area (i.e. Outmatched or Followed) at Planning phase, I play Faramir, engage an enemy and deal damage to that enemy... Do I deal 4 (because in the process of engagement you attach that trap) or just 2?

Reading Faramir card it says 'Engage that enemy AND deal 2 damage...' instead of 'Engage that enemy, THEN deal 2 damage...' Not sure if there's a chance to attach a trap if the wording is 'A and B' instead of 'A, then B'.

Thanks a lot!

> Quote
> 
> Both Followed and Outmatched created constant abilities while unattached in your play area. Constant abilities must be resolved instantly when their triggering condition is met, which means that they would be attached to the enemy the instant you engaged it. That means they will attach to the enemy at the same time that the damage is applied. Whenever two effects would resolve at the same time, the first player decides which one to resolve first. So it is up to you if you want to do 2 damage or 4.

I recently had an inquiry for Caleb regarding player cards, that may be added to the encounter deck:

The rules state, that every player may set up to 3 cards aside, which can potentially be added to the encounter deck: Ranger of the North, Wind from the Sea, Tom Bombadil and Eagle of the North. Now only Ranger Summons asks for "1 of your set aside" Rangers, the other events only ask for "a set aside" card. Does this mean, I can use cards in my deck, which target the set aside cards of other players, or may everyone only use his own set aside cards?

Question about archery and Loyal Hound: When assigning archery damage how does Loyal Hound interact with it, more specifically:

 1. Can I assign one archery damage on loyal hound and then discard it to prevent two archery damage on a hero?
 2. Can I assign two archery damage on loyal hound and discard it before it dies to prevent to archery damage on a hero?
 3. Can I assign one more archery damage to a hero than his/her HP, to then prevent it with Loyal Hound and bring back to less damage than HP, keeping the hero Alive?

> Quote
> 
> You cannot over-assign archery damage. You can only ever assign archery damage to a character equal to its remaining hit points. In the case of the Loyal Hound, you assign the archery damage before resolving it. Once it is assigned, you can use the Hound’s Response to discard it and cancel 2 damage that would be dealt to your hero. So if you assign 2 to the Hound and 2 to your hero, the Loyal Hound can essentially absorb 4 archery damage.

Asking about a card not actually released yet…

It's the Planning phase. I Sneak Attack a Silvan ally into play, then I play Host of Galadhrim. Does the delayed effect on Sneak Attack still "see" that same ally and thus return it to my hand at the end of the phase? Or did the process of resolving HoG make the game "lose track" of that ally (it left play briefly), thus letting it stick around having been played by HoG? Thanks!

Some contract clarifications obtained by @Seastan [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/240509-seastan/]:

Regarding the "Burglar's Turn" contract: It says that if the attachment has the guarded keyword when you attach it to the active location, you ignore it. But when the active is explored it says to "you may put each guarded attachment on that location into play at no cost". Would you then trigger the guarded keyword on a guarded player card?

Regarding the "Grey Wanderer" contract: If you start the game by choosing a guarded attachment as your one attachment, what happens? My understanding is that during the setup of the player cards, there is not yet an encounter deck with which to trigger the guarded keyword.

> Quote
> 
> ``````Burglar’s Turn bypasses the guarded keyword altogether. Once you explore that location, you can attach the guarded attachment to an eligible character.
> 
> The Grey Wanderer has a Setup ability. This should be resolved after you do the Setup on the quest. There will always be an encounter deck at that point.
> 
> Cheers, Caleb

Note that the Grey Wanderer part of this ruling implies that contract Setup is resolved at a different time than hero Setup (after setup step #7 and at step #3, respectively). In particular, you already have your post-mulligan starting hand when you do the contract Setup.

EDIT: Implied by the above, but an official small clarification from Caleb:



> With regard to Grey Wanderer, yes you could end up with the card you want in your opening hand.

Not a ruling, exactly—more of a verbal confirmation Caleb gave during a recent episode of Card Talk… (It also jibes with prior understanding of how this situation plays out, but it was nice to hear him state it plainly.)

If Sméagol is your last hero, and Stinker flips him to Gollum, you are not eliminated. Any damage that would be dealt from undefended attacks [framework step 6.4.3] while you're in this state evaporates into the ether.

Some questions on The Burglar's Turn Contract answered:

1) What happens when the Loot card you are about to put on a location is a unique item already in play? Do you place it out of play and draw a new Loot card for the location? Or do you place it out of play and the location gets no Loot card?

2) The second part of the contract says “When the active location is explored, you may put each guarded attachment on that location into play at no cost, or add it to your hand.” What happens if you attach an item to a location by traveling there, but then the location is pushed back into the staging area by a card effect such as Strider’s Path and is explored in the staging area? Do you still get to put the guarded attachment into play per the usual Guarded Objective rules and merely do not have the option of adding it to your hand, or is it placed entirely out of play?

> 
>  
> 
>  1. The rules for unique cards will prevent the loot from entering play. That will unfortunately cause the effect to whiff that turn.

(Besides what's explicitly asked, the below ruling also clears up things like the limit on ally Galdor in the context of triggering him off of hero Erestor's discard, which happens outside a round proper.)

You had a great interview on Card Talk the other day [https://youtu.be/ri5AtxinPq4 [https://youtu.be/ri5AtxinPq4]]. Thanks for that!

In it, you are asked about Spirit Dain and "at the end of the phase" attacks. You gave an answer that was quite clear, except the audio cut out a little at the end. So just to clarify:

Dain defends during the Combat phase, using his action 3 times. Then, an attack occurs at the end of the phase. If Dain is ready somehow and defends against this new attack, he can again use his action up to 3 times, with the "limit 3 times per phase" now applying to both this attack (not in a phase) along with the NEXT phase (in this case, the Refresh phase)…?

@PeaceAndThought on the CotR Discord asked about Host of Galadhrim putting out a Galadhrim Weaver and got this ruling:

> Quote
> 
> Host does not enter your discard pile until you fully resolve its effect. That means it will “float” until you have put all your Silvan allies back into play and resolved their ‘enters play’ effects. [Ed: emphasis added]

I was confused by this, as the Weaver has an "After… enters play" trigger condition, and I thought the HoG would be done resolving by the time the Weaver would trigger. So I asked for clarification:

You recently shared a ruling with a community member re: Host of Galadhrim and a Galadhrim Weaver, stating that the event would still be floating outside the discard pile at the time that the Weaver's Response [could be] triggered.

I just want to clarify this, as the Weaver has an "after... enters play" Response—we should consider events as still resolving until all triggered effects due to things the event may have incited (even "after"s) have completely resolved as well?

Related: is it also the case that Sneak Attack and Tree People are still outside the discard pile at the time the Weaver triggers (if a Weaver is the relevant ally put into play)?

Ally Galadriel puts an attachment into play, as opposed to playing it. Vilya also can do this. Can this attachment be put on another player's character?

Of course, the rules for attachment cards specifically say you can "play" them on other players' characters. But RR Ownership and Control [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule562] states "By default, cards enter play under their owner's control". I wasn't sure if that was intended to still apply with Galadriel/Vilya.

> Quote

(This was a @GrandSpleen [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/177891-grandspleen/] question, but I submitted the query…)

Lots of people are excited about Saruman and his Staff—great design! A question his Staff brings up: suppose you use it to reduce the Doomed value of the next event by 2. Then you want to use the Response on a Steward of Orthanc to give an otherwise vanilla event Doomed 1. This would end up being Doomed 0 because of the Staff's lasting effect… Do you still get to draw a card from that Steward of Orthanc?

The hesitation comes from wondering whether we really paid the price of "give it Doomed 1" or not. Thanks in advance!

This is a Caleb ruling back from 2018, but I can't seem to find it recorded on the forum, so I share it now:

> Quote
> 
> When an effect raises your threat by 1 “for each X” you should calculate the total and then raise your threat all at once. So if you have 5 characters not committed to the quest when Pursued by Shadow is revealed, you would raise your threat by 5 all at once, not by 1 five times. That means Elfhelm’s ability would cause you to raise your threat by 4 instead of 5.

In that regard, the rules reference should probably be updated to say “has not yet attacked the active player” in order to make that more clear. I will make a note to do that with the next FAQ update.

> Setup effects are resolved during step 7 of the game Setup instructions. You should resolve player card Setup abilities after resolving the Setup instructions for the scenario. That does mean it is possible that you could draw your only copy of a card before that, so it is good to include multiple copies or have a back up plan. It also means that Guarded cards will pull cards from the encounter deck.

Q1. “After characters are committed to the quest” is the same as “after the players have committed characters to the quest.”

Q2. Setup abilities should be resolved during step 7 of the Setup rules for the game: “Follow Scenario Setup Instruction.” Resolve the scenario Setup instructions first, and then resolve any player card Setup instructions. The only exception to this is Gandalf’s Delay. That card doesn’t actually work as intended as written, but we have never issued errata because players seem to have intuited how it was meant to work and resolved it on their own. It does however create confusion with regard to other Setup abilities as you pointed out, but if you understand that Gandalf’s Delay is the exception and not the rule, the rest of the Setup effects work as intended.

Q3. It is possible to draw the card you want to search for in your opening hand with Messenger of the King and The Grey Wanderer. In those cases it is prudent to have a backup plan.

Caleb

Courtesy of @Mortendall on the CotR Discord, a clarification re: Under the Ash Mountains. As it has not released in, say, the U.S. yet, I will edit the ruling slightly to minimize quest spoilage for those who haven't played it.

There is a player elimination condition listed in the rulesheet as being checked only at the end of the round. But the quest cards phrase it in a way that could be interpreted as: if the condition is satisfied at any time, the relevant player is eliminated. However, Caleb clarified:

> Quote

This is kind of a confirmation of something that was in the original rules, but not explicitly stated in the RR:

Can you declare an attack against an enemy with 0 characters you control?

This can matter if all of your characters are exhausted, and your partner has a Ranged character with readying: the answer to the question determines whether an enemy you have engaged can be attacked once or twice by said Ranged character.

Good question. If one asked Caleb, I do see an out for him disallowing Keeping Count resources for paying… Heroes, as well as allies like Treebeard, collect resources into a resource pool, whereas Keeping Count merely gets resource tokens placed upon it. Spending may (or may not) require paying from a pool—I don't see an obvious place in the rules that specifies either way for things like Wilyador (though you do have to pay from a pool to play cards).

I would recommend not asking, heh.

Not sure if this was recorded for posterity here… Wrath and Ruin's 1A text doesn't make it clear whether the Makeshift Fortification made active can be from the initially chosen set of locations in the staging area, or not.

On the CotR Discord, Caleb himself said:
