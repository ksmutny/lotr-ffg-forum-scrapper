The wording on this card is confusing me.  When an enemy gets this attached to him, does that mean anybody can attack him immediately, or do you have to wait until the combat phase?  Does it mean that from now on that enemy can be attacked by basically anyone--as if everyone suddenly had the ranged keyword for that enemy?  Or what?  Not sure how to use this card.  

 

Thanks for any help on this.

Ok, I sent the question into FFG and Caleb clarified that you do, indeed, have each player do their own attacks against the enemy during their own attack windows. Sad. This card would be much more powerful if every player could attack at the same time, but it's still powerful, especially since we can attack it even if it's in the staging area.
