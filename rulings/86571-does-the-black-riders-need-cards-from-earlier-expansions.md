I´m sorry if that question has been asked before, but I couldn´t find any answer to this...

 

I´m only a few months into playing and don´t have that many cards yet (Core Set + Mirkwood I + II). I´m wondering whether "The Black Riders" is a fresh start (playable with the Core Set only) or should I have all previous cards to have a chance against the scenarios.

 

There are many great ideas lurking in that expansion, and I want to buy and play this one as soon as possible, so...?

It's hard to answer your question definitively since Black Riders hasn't been released yet, so we don't know what the scenarios are actually like in terms of difficulty.

 

My guess is yes, it should be possible to play (and enjoy) with just the Core set + Black Riders, since:

 

1. This is the first expansion with Easy mode "built in" (at least, incorporated into the printed cards) in advance.

2. The saga expansions in particular are specifically playtested to make sure they work well together with just a Core set.  In fact there's an interview, just published today, where Caleb Grace (lead designer for the game) talks about this very thing: http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/07/17/interview-caleb-grace-lead-developer/ [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/07/17/interview-caleb-grace-lead-developer/]
