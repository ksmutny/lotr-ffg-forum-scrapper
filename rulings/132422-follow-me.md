This is the card:

I have thought a question: for example in planning --> can you return to play cards if the player before your turn play this event?

 

This is the example:

1st player plays

2nd player plays

you (3rd player) plays

4th player plays

...during the turn of the 4th player, 2nd player plays this event

 

the question is: he can return to play another turn of planning phase? and after you also?

I couldn't find any wording or anything in the rule book that makes it obvious that this does not work. The closest thing that I found was the way they wrote out the Turn Sequence. Here is how it looks:

>  * First player plays ally and attachment cards.
>    * Player actions
>  * Next player plays ally and attachment cards, etc.
>    * Player actions

 

The fact that they specified First player as a separate part of the turn sequence makes it seem like once that portion is completed and you've moved on to the "next player", it no longer matters who the first player is.
 
I'm going to ask Caleb, though.

Caleb says:

The planning phase ends after the last player has played his turn and all players pass on taking further planning actions. If a player (other than the current first player) plays Follow Me during the planning phase, then the last player position changes and play will continue normally until that player has played his turn. That would allow players to have extra turns during the planning phase.

 

Cheers,
Caleb

 

Soooo, YES. You can use Follow Me to manipulate the number of times a person can play cards for the planning phase.

I don't understand why Caleb say that we can use follow me! to expense planning phase. But we don't see anything about who play last in planning phase so he just clarify this. Why not.

Rules are clear about combat phase: you need to resolve every enemy attack before go further it the game. So follow me! will never work as a feint.

I recently read an opposite ruling of Caleb:

> Hi Chris, In the planning phase, each player has 1 opportunity to play allies and attachments, starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise. Once each player has had the opportunity to play and passed, the planning phase ends. If someone plays Follow Me! it does not grant extra opportunities to play allies and attachments. Play continues to proceed clockwise until each player has had their opportunity. If you take control of the first player token after you had your opportunity to play cards, play will automatically proceed through player order until it reaches a player who has not passed. Once all players have had their opportunity and passed, the phase ends. Cheers, Caleb
