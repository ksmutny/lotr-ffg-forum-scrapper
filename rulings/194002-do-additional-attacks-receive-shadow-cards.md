# [Do Additional Attacks Receive Shadow Cards?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194002-do-additional-attacks-receive-shadow-cards/)

This is a curiosity that the FAQ leaves woefully unclear.

 

FAQ §1.42 "Additional attacks by an enemy":

>  
> 
> When an enemy makes an additional attack, discard all of its previously dealt shadow cards before dealing it a new shadow card.

 

Note that this does not actually say to deal the enemy a shadow card for the new attack, only that you should discard any existing ones before the enemy makes its second attack. Nowhere else in the FAQ or core rulebook does it even mention multiple attacks by one enemy, much less any potential shadow cards dealt to them.

 

Also note that within the normal framework of the game, dealing shadow cards to engaged enemies is done only at the beginning of the combat phase (as per the core rulebook, and barring any specific card effects which instruct one to deal shadow cards).

 

Unfortunately, the card pool itself doesn't give any consideration or set any precedence for a specific answer.

 

Lord Alcaron specifically tells you to deal a new shadow card:

>  
> 
> Forced: When Lord Alcaron is dealt a shadow card with no shadow effect, he makes an additional attack after this one (deal and resolve another shadow card).

 

But Old Orc-eyes (from Murder at the Prancing Pony) specifically tells you to not deal a new shadow card:

>  
> 
> Forced: After an attack resolves in which Old Orc-eyes was dealt a shadow card with no shadow effect, he makes an additional attack against you. Do not deal Old Orc-eyes a shadow cad for this attack.

 

No other card in the existing card pool which contain the possibility for additional attacks (for example, Smaug the Magnificent, Angmar Captain, or the shadow effect of Lawless Ruffian, which spawned this question) specify either way.

 

EDIT:

FAQ §1.26 "Enemy attacks outside of the combat phase" could be seen as setting a precedence for all attacks being dealt a shadow card, but again, nothing is specific about "additional attack" text.

Honestly? I've been dealing them shadow cards since I began back in the Mirkwood Cycle...a recent rules issue prompted by the Murder at the Prancing Pony scenario forced me to peruse the FAQ again, which is when I came across §1.42. The text is ambiguous, which lead to the possibility of having done it incorrectly for a long time. Our group has had similar revelations before, most recently in the Guarded keyword (we never realized it had an in-born "Surge"-like effect). Thus, when I found no rulings online, and no definitive discussions on it in these forums, I figured I'd ask. Since no one responded with a definitive answer, instead with RAI-based rhetoric, I figured I'd argue the opposite, such that some form of acceptable truth would surface. Instead, it opened up other worm cans, and the discovery of more ambiguities and inconsistencies within the FAQ/Core Rules regarding the treatment of shadow cards.

 

It makes me sad to think that we haven't seen a new FAQ in over ten months, considering how the game has changed since then. It's a shame that the devs don't seem to lurk in these forums, since they could easily pick up on what needs to be addressed. We can't bug Caleb about every little thing...
