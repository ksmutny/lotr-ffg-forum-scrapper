I'm curious if anyone knows if using Sneak Attack with the Gloin ally grants you Gloin's 2 resources, assuming you have the 5 dwarves neccesary.  My reading of the text says yes but I want to make sure that's correct.

That's true Dam, there are already official rulings to all this. But for some reason, people like it better when they know for a fact that the developer has confirmed it. reir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/reir.gif]

Anyway, here it is, and Dam is correct.

No. Gloin's response triggers after you "play from hand" whereas Sneak attack reads "put an ally into play…" The difference between "play" and "put into play" is key here. To play an ally from hand, you must pay that ally's cost during the planning phase. That is the only time you can trigger Gloin's response.
Cheers,
Caleb
