So now that those who attended Gen Con have gotten to play Siege (probably several times), what does everybody think? Was it what we expected? What things helped you succeed? Did you like it more or less than other Gen Con quests?

My group of twelve got to play it twice on Sunday. I definitely enjoyed it more than I thought I would, and I've even enjoyed playing it solo. I especially like how the first stage of the quest is time counter based rather than quest point based. It really lends to the feel that the siege is upon you, and you can't delay it by questing slowly. In fact, you want to quest hard so that you can help ready the city's defences for the assault. We found that questing is definitely important and that it is pretty easy to get location locked if you're not careful (those locations generally have high threat). There can be alot of combat, but we actually seem to have managed that part pretty well. I really enjoyed the quest. I might still like the Ruins of Belegost more, but that one is nearly impossible solo, whereas this one can actually scale to 1-12 players like it claimed. Great job Caleb!
