I have 2 questions concerning the hero "Dunhere" with an "Unexpected Courage" attached:

1. Is it possible for Dunhere to attack the same enemy in the staging area twice using the unexpected courage to ready in between? I am unsure because the rule book says each enemy may only be the target of one attack each round whereas the official FAQ (part 1.11) says that whenever a character accomplishes to ready he may attack the same target again…

2. But if FAQ is right, are those follow up attacks to be added together (as in the rule book whenever more characters attack the same enemy) enabling him to overcome the enemy armor easier thus counting the armor only once? Or does each attack subtract the armor individually?

Or more simple: which one is the correct way?

Dunhere attacks in the staging area (= attack 3) the same enemy (armor 2) twice with readying in between…

a) (3 - 2) + (3 - 2) = 2 damage done

b) (3 + 3) - 2 = 4 damage done

Thank you!

I think that order would not matter in this case. Moreover we have the Golden Rule:

 

If the game text of a card contradicts the text of this
rulebook, the text on the card takes precedence.

 

But to be 100% sure I think that we can ask Caleb on this.
