1) Can other heroes use their resources to help Gandalf pay for the top card? For example, could spirit Pippin plus Gandalf each pay 1 resource to pay for Unexpected Courage?

2) Can other heroes use their resources pay for the top card without Gandalf? For example, could tactics Merry pay 1 resource to pay for Halfling Determination?

Thank you for all the replies. FFG (Caleb Grace) & Tales From The Cards agreed with us.

FFG:

1. Gandalf’s ability allows you to play the top card of your deck as if it was from your hand, so you can pay for it like any other card you play from your hand. That means you can use resources from other heroes you control (as long as there is a resource match).

2. Yes.

3. Resources from Gandalf’s pool can be used to pay for neutral cards played from your hand.

Tales From The Cards:

1. Yes, other heroes can help pay for the top card. This is because Gandalf's ability states that you can play the top card "as if it were in your hand", meaning that you treat it literally as if you were playing any other card in your hand, including other heroes being able to pay for it.

2. Yes, for the same reasons as above.
