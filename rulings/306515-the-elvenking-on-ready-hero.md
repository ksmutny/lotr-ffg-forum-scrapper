Can you trigger Elvenking on a ready hero, only to bring a silvan ally back into your hand?

No. If an ability's effect does not have the potential to change the board state, then you cannot pay the cost, or indeed trigger it in the first place. In this case, since you cannot ready the hero, you cannot pay the cost of returning a Silvan ally to hand.

RR Ability, Card Ability [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule493] has the rules text, and this ruling explicitly addresses it as well:

In particular from there:

So if Boromir is ready,  you cannot raise your threat by 1 to ready him because it has no effect. Similarly, you cannot play Ever Vigilant to ready an ally who is ready because again it has no effect.
