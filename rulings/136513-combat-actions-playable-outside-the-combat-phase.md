Hi,

 

meanwhile we got a couple of effects which let an enemy attack outside the combat phase. 

It is possible to play cards with the Combat Action-keyword like Feint in such attacks?

 

If i read the rules correct, then the answer is no (Page 23):

> Some action triggers are preceded by a specific phase of the game. This type of trigger means that the following action can only be triggered during the specified phase. For example, an effect with the trigger “Quest Action:” can only be triggered during an action window of the quest phase. Actions without a specified phase can be triggered during any action window throughout the round. (See the “Turn Sequence” chart on pages 30-31.) The hero card Glorfindel provides an example of an action that can be used during any player action window. The event card Radagast’s Cunning provides an example of an action that can only be used during the quest phase.

We got an answer from Caleb. Super hard to find it back (or I'm just being super lazy). You just follow each step of an attack like described in the rulebook, just skipping the "1. choose an enemy".
