Man, for all you "theme" solo players out there, get ready for a brutal quest -- the threat gain is just unreal. The trolls are nasty. The "sack" deck is worse. I've tried this quest a few times with no success. So much damage, so much threat gain. I'm not ready to declare it unplayable solo, but it definitely requires a well-tailored deck.

And forget only having characters that were alive at the time of The Hobbit. haha.

 I never travelled to the Lake.  I just played Path of Need on it.  Caleb has already ruled that PoN doesn't directly interact with the card it's attached to so it is legal to play it on it.  But you're right that PoN's effect only works when the location is active.  Back to the drawing board.

I have been playing the game since it came out, but this is my first card game.  You should get your own forum because clearly none of the rest of us are worthy of you.

Really??? Caleb say this? . I never heard about it……..Can you show me a link about?

Anyway so how you can use POD if you cannot travel to Lake so POD is useless right? And i still dont understand how yo can play POD on location which one is immune to player card effect.

And please speak from your self ok Dont talk from community here. No one can do it.

I have nothing against you personally. Dont worry about it. Everyone do mistake but dont everyone point your mistakes. I do.That all.
