I tried getting some clarification on this in another thread, but it didn't go anywhere, so let's try again.

This came up during my last play through of the "Battle of Five Armies" and Bolg. 

I took "immune to player card effects" to mean that cards that did direct things to him (like lowering his stats or direct damage via Gandalf or Descendant of Throndor) could not be used. Likewise, one couldn't get any affect from something like a Forest Snare on him. However, I'm not so sure about cards like Hands Upon the Bow, Great Yew Bow, or Dunhere that let you attack enemies in the staging area.

Bolg has to be damageable by attacks, or else you could never win, and those cards just let a hero make an attack. I'd say Bard's -2 Defense power couldn't be used against him, but using the Yew Bow to declare him as the target of an attack isn't the same thing as affecting him with the card. The Yew Bow is affecting Bard, Bolg is being affected by the attack. 

So long as there are no Bodyguards in play, I think smacking Bolg before stage 5 is a legitimate way to go. I'd love to hear what others say on the topic though.

I sent a message a few days ago. No response as of yet.

I got a response from Caleb:


"Cards that allow players to attack enemies in the staging area like Great Yew Bow and Dunhere instruct the player to 'choose' or 'target' an enemy in the staging area first. By definition, enemies that are immune to player card effects cannot be targeted or chosen in this manner. 
In regard to Bolg, his immunity to player card effects prevents him from being damaged or removed from play before the players reach stage 5. The only way Bolg can be defeated is by making normal attacks against him at stage 5 where he is considered to be engaged with the first player.
Cheers,
Caleb"

I'm still a bit confused about the distinction being made here, but it's a ruling.

It also means that I haven't legitimately beaten the Battle of Five Armies yet. avergonzado_triste [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/avergonzado_triste.gif]

There has been an updated ruling:

"Hi Thaddeus,

I wanted to follow up with you on this question because I revisited my original answer with my coworkers and we agreed that Hands Upon the Bow and Quick Strike can be used to attack enemies with "immune to player card effects" because those two cards are targeting a character and not the enemy. (The bit about "an eligible enemy target" on Quick Strike is only there to clarify that non-ranged characters cannot attack enemies engaged with other players when resolving its effect.) Dunhere and Great Yew Bow don't work against enemies that are immune to player card effects because they do directly target the enemy.
This means that when playing The Battle of Five Armies scenario, you could in fact use Hands Upon the Bow to attack Bolg in the staging area.
Sorry for the confusion with my original answer. I hope you are enjoying the On the Doorstep expansion!
Cheers,
Caleb"
 
 
 
So "Immune to Player Card Effects" protects an enemy from a card effect that would select them as a target, but not cards that allow a character to make an attack.
 
Hands Upon the Bow or Quick Strike = Yes
Great Yew Bow or Dunhere = No
