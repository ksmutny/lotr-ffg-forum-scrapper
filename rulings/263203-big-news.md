With Caleb's pre-announcement about some upcoming big news what do folks think it is? I think next cycle is most likely, but what are the other realistic possibilities?  

-Revised Core (like Netrunner recently got)

-2nd edition (like GoT)

-Some kind of new licensing agreement that allows them access to other periods (.e. First Age)

I can't really think of any other possibilities that seem likely.....any other ideas?

I wonder if Caleb is regretting teasing these news and building up so much hype and crazy ideas when the news is just going to be the next AP is shipping.

Anybody thought about a versus mode or a real competitive mode ? This could legitimate FAQ 1.9 and the fact that Caleb talked about "metagame".

That's been bandied about.  I would love to have that, but I fear we are only going to get one or the other.  So I would like to keep the co-op for a while longer.

I'm here to eat a crebain pie.

I played Magic Duels for years and thought that was a great game, so I'm going to give it a chance.  But we'll see.

My biggest worry is the drain on Caleb's time and its effect on the physical version.

Caleb explained that there will be no more combat phases, no resource matches and some cards effects will be simplify (i.e sneak attack).

It looks like a lame heartstone or pathfinder game.

Resource match still exists, but it works differently.

Ok. I watched it. Not much was said or shown, so my thoughts gonna be few as well.

 

First: Current visuals look awful, I sincerely hope they do something with it before the release, as I've already said, aesthetic is a very important part of any card game, and current aesthetic of the game is severly lacking.

As for change in the resource system, I think it is interesting, and not particularly good or bad. It presents with more deckbuilding freedom and opportunities, while also reducing the need to fiddle with the resources. Some people will like it, some people might hate it. I can see the good and interesting in both of them.

The system where enemies and characters damage each other simultaneously I am not sure about, because I currently don't know how this gonna work exactly. There is many different ways this can be done.

Random - I am always against random. Caleb announced that Sneak Attack now summons a random ally instead of somebody from your hand. I don't like it. But then again, this is a co-op card game, so random might be not that severe here.

Encounter deck being an acutal AI controlled player with options and resource I consider a strong GOOD change for one simple reason - how many times you had to forfiet the game turn 1? Exactly, game has no way of controlling the high roll unwinnable turn 1 situations. But with this change, encounter deck might now play in a growing curve, achieving what we have always wanted - easier start, tougher mid to endgame.

Economy model - digital LCG is good. Pay for what you want, not for bunch of random stuff. Nuff said.

Caleb talked as if the games last 5 minutes.  Not sure how I feel about that.

Caleb, via the announcement article, https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/12/9/new-journeys-in-middle-earth/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/12/9/new-journeys-in-middle-earth/]:



> The translation from physical to digital also gave us the unique opportunity to evaluate which game elements were essential to the experience, and which ones could be trimmed in order to create a game that can be played in easily digestible 10-20 minute play-sessions.

It took a moment, but the big disappointement, that it's not "just" a digital version of the game is gone now (really would have loved an "offical OCTGN Version" with less "rough edges"). It just reads like a different game that I can look forward to and hope ends up great. 

Even though I hope for the best, there are more negative points for me at the moment than positive:

1. As John said, the screenshots are just ugly. Really the first thing that came thorugh my mind was "urgh". From the card layouts over the buttons to the backround, everything looks "cheap", like it was done in a hurry. Even the card artworks somehow look bad, even though they are the same as the physical version... There are so many great location artworks and it looks that they are substituted by at least second class 3D animations. I could go on, but this really has to improve or it will be hard to enjoy. Hopeully it looks better in motion.

2. Everything about the gameplay has to wait until there is at least a recorded match to see the changes in action. 

3. Randomness. Oh god why. The change to sneak attack (now simply summoning ANY random ally) doesn't feel good to me. I play Hearthstone and can live with the use of randomness there. But it was there all along. I know the lotr LCG works wihout extra randomness and now it gets added. I know the ups and downs of random effects and see why they can be fun, but I will always prefer to have as less as possible. 
Also the theme of giving you the feeling of laying out a trap for the opponent is gone and now it's just this "Deus ex machine" feeling, that you know that "Someone" will appear to hopefully save the day.
Adding to this: Sneak attack havin this new effect means it can't have it's old one. Meaning the effect will be completely gone, because why create a new card for an existing effect, when you can just use the ols one. I fear this could be a sign of reduced interaction via events during the "adventuring" phase, focusing on "minion smashing" :S 

4. AI. A double edged sword. If the AI is weak the game will crash and burn. Noone wants to play against a dumb AI. But as they say that threat is still in the game I think this will "somehow" influence which cards the AI can play agains you making it relative for it to play the "strongest cards". Silly combat decisions will be a blowout too. Tasking an AI with all the decisions we did outselfs for so many years is dangerous an for me it was a very fun part "in multiplayer" to figure out how to distribute the enemies. Sad to see this go :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

5. This being a f2p-game is no surprise and I can live with it, as there enough ways to keep the game accessable without money, while offering incentive to invest some, if you can afford it. Obviously we have to wait for the prices.

6. But now the most important point for me: Caleb works on the game. No matter when I see or hear something from him, he always seems so full of passion for the game and Lotr in general and I can't imagine him advising or implementing (not sure how big his role in the development of the digital version is) a change he doesn't feel good about. So even with all the questionsmarks above, I still have hope that the final product will be great once I get to play it.

Yeah, I mentioned randomness in my prev post, but now I want to pay a little bit more attention to it.

As someone who spent loads of free time doing custom cards and reworks for LotR LCG, LotR LCG-related modifications (Innistrad MTG, Call of Cthulhu before Arkham LCG was announced), I simply don't understand Caleb's excitement with his ability to do random effect thanks to the digitalness of the game. I mean, digitalness of the game allows for TONS of cool stuff to be done, not just random... but to take a perfectly fine and iconic original card that had a cool effect that involved deckbuilding (ok, who am I kidding, it involved including neutral Gandalf into your deck, but still), and just water it down to a button with "random" on it? That seems like a very poor use of digital potential to me. If digital Sneak Attack stays that way, then I predict that people will stop using it as soon as card pool grows and decks can be filled with cards that player can predict and control. Imagine if they change Gandalf from choose to random? Man, this is not how use the random effect to the game's advantage.
