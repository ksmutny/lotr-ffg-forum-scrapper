Hi folks,

 

i had in mind that there was a thread about Bilbo and Iron Shackles where you do not draw your normal 1 card instead you discard Iron Shakles and then draw your additional card from Bilbo. 

But... i do not find this thread, so i opened a new one.

 

First  i'm confused about the text of these cards:

 

Bilbo: The first player draws 1 additional card in the resource phase.

 

Cirdan the Shipwright: Draw 1 additional card at the beginning of the resource phase.

 

Erestor: Draw 3 additional cards at the beginning of the resource phase.

 

Ori: If you control at least 5 Dwarf characters, draw 1 additional card at the beginning of the resource phase.

 

Cirdan, Erestor and Ori let me draw cards before i draw my normal one, while Bilbo let me draw after i draw my normal one. Right?

If i'm right, Cirdan's Forced-Effect does not make sense.

 

So my intention is, that "at the beginning of the resource phase" is equal to "in the resource phase".

So the initial intention that you simply draw more cards during the resource phase is correct, but i think the description "at the beginning ..." is bad.

That's your own interpretation you're imposing on the game rather than how it actually works. In fact, most of the things which happen at the beginning of a phase I can think of are the phase's required actions, like collecting resources, drawing cards, dealing shadow cards, assigning archery damage, raising threat, readying cards and passing the first player token.

The examples GrandSpleen gave were for the quest phase, which don't really tell us anything as nothing happens at the beginning of the quest phase, there's just an action window before committing to the quest.

The Mariner's Compass triggers at the beginning of the Travel phase, but that I think is different as it's a Response and thus interrupts the usual flow of play in any case.

And finally, in Blood of Gondor: "At the beginning of the combat phase, each player must either turn each of his hidden cards faceup or take 1 hidden card." And this one we know for a fact does not supersede other "beginning of the phase" stuff, because Caleb made a ruling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96446-rule-questions-regarding-the-blood-of-gondor-quest/] that you could deal shadow cards first, then flip hidden cards so the flipped enemies wouldn't get shadows.

 

If you can think of any examples which would support your view of how such effects are typically resolved, please say so.

The Blood of Gondor example is pretty telling, isn't it? 

 

The rules in the rulebook state this as well:  "At the beginning of the combat phase, the players deal 1 shadow card to each engaged enemy."

 

In the example of playing Blood of Gondor and entering the combat phase, the players can choose to deal shadow cards or resolve the passive effect from Blood of Gondor first because each effect includes the text "at the beginning of".

 

What you will notice, is "At the beginning of" is noticeably absent from the rule book when talking about gaining resources and drawing cards during the resource phase.  If the intent is that these happen "At the beginning of" the resource phase, then it needs to be clearly laid out in the rule book and at which point the players could choose whether they gain resources or draw their card first.  Unfortunately, they can't do that because the rule book specifically states that collecting the resource comes BEFORE drawing the card.  This means that drawing the card definitely does not happen "At the beginning" of that phase.  If anything, collecting resources does.

 

Edit: "At the beginning of" is absent from all of the effects you mentioned in the Core Set rulebook excluding dealing shadow cards based on a quick glance (perhaps some of them I overlooked).  Dealing shadow cards is explicitly mentioned as something that happens "At the beginning of" the phase.  Also, I wouldn't be surprised if the developers decided that each of these effects does happen "At the beginning" of their respective phases, but without the rulebook stating "At the begining of" before them, I see no reason to interpret them as such.

That's why I think they are good examples...

 

Sounds like you're interpreting "the beginning" of the phase to mean "the red action that comes first on the timing chart." And you are considering green blocks NOT to occur "at the beginning of the phase" (hence, you wrote "nothing happens at the beginning of the quest phase).  So then the wording "draw an additional card at the beginning of the resource phrase" is simply describing that red timing block.  In my opinion, that is exactly what the designers intend when they wrote Bilbo, Cirdan, whatever.  All supposed to be happening within that time window that you would typically be drawing a card whether they use the word "beginning" or not.  However, I think they also use the word "beginning" in a different way elsewhere.  

 

The Blood of Gondor example is a great one.  In that case "beginning" does actually supercede the dealing of shadow cards, if you want it to.  Both of those effects (flipping hidden cards or dealing shadow cards) are described as happening "at the beginning" of the phase.  Since they happen at the same time, the first player may choose the order in which to resolve them (that was Caleb's ruling).  This is an example of the word "beginning" being used to mean "before doing anything else in the phase that is written on the timing chart."  

 

If you apply that meaning of the word to Cirdan, you will draw 1 "additional" card, be forced to discard it, then do your regular card draw and resource.  Obviously this is not intended.
