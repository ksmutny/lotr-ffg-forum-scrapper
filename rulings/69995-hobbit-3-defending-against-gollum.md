Hello everyone,

I was wondering, do we think that we have to exhaust Bilbo to defend against Gollum when he attacks after failing to find a match to a riddle?

I encountered a scenario where Gollum attacked twice in one round and I realized Bilbo was exhausted and so took two damage from an undefended attack and died immediately.

I think I know that the answer is 'yes, we do have to exhaust him' but I don't want to believe it and I need to hear someone else say it! ha ha!

 

Cheers!

You shuffle your deck immediately before discarding cards to the riddle effect. Gildor and the Stargazer won't help.

 

 

Question: Is there an action window between shuffling the deck and revealing cards for the riddle? (Thematically, I assume there isn't…)



It's a bit unclear. Caleb Grace of FFG has said that "players can take actions when answering a riddle," but the only example in the Hobbit rules insert involves taking an action AFTER revealing riddle cards. Based on that example, I'd be inclined to say that you can't take actions between shuffling and revealing, but I haven't seen anything definitive.
