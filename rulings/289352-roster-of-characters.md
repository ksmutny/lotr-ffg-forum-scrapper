While listening to LOTR audio while traveling, I started wondering how many named characters (especially with dialogue) don't yet have cards in the game.  So I thought I'd take a systematic approach and look at them chapter by chapter.  With one post per day I could get through the entire work in less than two months.  I'll put a * symbol by those that have dialogue, and put a bracket around those who are dead/departed by 3001 (year of Bilbo's Party).  Names are listed in order of appearance, and cards spoiled but not released are included.

I:1 A Long Expected Party

*Bilbo Baggins (2 saga heroes, Lo Hero, Ta Hero, Sp Ally)

*Frodo Baggins (4 saga heroes, Sp Hero)

[Old Took]

*Ham (Gaffer) Gamgee (Lo Ally)

*Sam Gamgee (Le Hero, Sp Ally)

*Old Noakes

*Daddy Twofoot

[Drogo Baggins]

[Primula Bandybuck]

[Old Master Gorbadoc Brandybuck]

*Sandyman the miller

[Holman Gamgee]

*Gandalf (N hero, two Ne allies)

*Otho Sackville-Baggins

*Lobelia Sackville-Baggins

*Odo Proudfoot

Everard Took

Melilot Brandybuck

*Rory Brandybuck

*Gollum/Smeagol (two objective allies, one objective, three enemies)

Adelard Took

Dora Baggins

Milo Burrows

Angelica Baggins

Hugo Bracegirdle

*Merry Brandybuck (Sp Hero, Ta Hero)

Sancho Proudfoot

Those without cards never left the shire, though I'd like to see Lobelia getting a card for whacking ruffians with her umbrella.  Merry needs an ally version, and both Frodo and Sam deserve another hero version.

I'm pretty sure that the next cycle will takes place in the Shire.

FFG, or at least Caleb and Matt likes patterns.

First pattern: 

All of the FFG created heroes were out in the 2d or / and in 5th AP of each cycle. (except for Khaliel)

Cycle 3 : Deluxe Main faction -> Gondor

AP 2: Mirlonde (Silvan)

AP 5: Caldara (Gondor)

Cycle 4:  Deluxe Main faction ->   Rohan

AP 2: Idraen (Dunedain)

Cycle 5 : Deluxe Main faction ->  Dunedain

AP 2: Rossiel (Silvan)

AP 5: Amathiul (Dunedain)

Cycle 6: Deluxe Main faction ->  Noldor

AP 2: Lanwyn (Dale)

AP 5: Na 'Assiyah (Corsair)

Cycle 7: Deluxe Main faction -> Silvan / Dwarf 

AP 1: Kahliel (Harad)

AP 2: Thurindir (Dunedain)

Cycle 8: Deluxe Main faction -> Dale

AP 2: Haldan (Woodman)

 

Second pattern, there is a FFG created hero related to the current cycle faction in each cycle (except the 4th cycle...).

Cycle 3: Caldara (Gondor)

Cycle 5: Amathiul (Dunedain)

Cycle 6: Na 'Assiyah (Corsair)

Cycle 7: Kahliel (Harad)

Cycle 8: Haldan (Woodman)

 

Third pattern there is a link between hero of AP 2 and AP 5 and the next cycle (or the following).

Cycle 1 AP 5 Boromir (Gondor) --> Cycle 3 Gondor

Cycle 4 AP 2 Idraen (Dunedain) --> Cycle 5 Dunedain

Cycle 4 AP 5 Galadriel (Noldor) --> Cycle 6 Noldor

Cycle 5 AP 2  Rossiel (Silvan) --> Cycle 7 Silvan / Dwarf

Cycle 6 AP 2 Lanwyn (Dale) --> Cycle 8 Dale 

 

Cycle 7 AP 2 Thurindir (Dunedain) --> Cycle 9 Dunedain ? 

Cycle 7 AP 5 Floco (Hobbit) --> Cycle 9 Hobbit ? 

Cycle 8 AP 5 Bilbo (Hobbit) --> Cycle 9 Hobbit ? 

 

So for me it's obvious:

Cycle 9 will be either a Dunedain or a Hobbit cycle. We already went to Arnor, so i'll bet we will discover the Shire in the next cycle.

Hopefully Bladorthin is not just a coarse pun.  I've seen speculation that Bladorthin was lord of Dorwinion -- if Caleb has seen the same speculation, we may yet see some reference to him in the next cycle.
