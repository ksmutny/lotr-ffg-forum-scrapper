# [A question regarding activation limits](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205277-a-question-regarding-activation-limits/)

Hello, just a couple of quick questions regarding the rulings on how many times cards with a limit of per round or per phase can be played. The specific cards I am going to be referring to will be Heavy Stroke, Protector of Lorien, and Desperate Alliance. Each of the cards have a limit placed on how many times they can be played/activated per phase. As I understood the rules for Protector of Lorien, if you had 2 copies of the card on 2 different heroes you could discard 6 cards in one phase (3 to each copy of the card). So in regards to Heavy Stroke if a dwarf dealt 2 damage to an enemy, could each player play a copy of Heavy stroke as a response in order to deal an additional 8 damage (in a 4 player game)? In the rules it says that the limitation on activations is per card. Does that mean each instance of that card, or the name of that specific card? Meaning, am I playing Protector of Lorien wrong by activating it more than 3 times per phase even though I have more than one in play? Is the restriction per card PER PLAYER, or just per card period? The real reason for the question is because of the card Desperate Alliance. Our group was trying to figure out if you could play it on a Hero and give it to someone else, then have that player play Desperate Alliance on that same Hero and give it back to its original owner, then at the end of the phase have the 1st player stack the returns of the Hero such that the 2nd player gains a permanent 4th Hero? It has a limit of 1 per phase, so it became unclear as to if we have been playing other cards wrong, or did the trick work as we thought it did? Sorry for the long post, but I thought framing the question might help explain why or why not these interactions were being played correctly. Any help would be much appreciated, Thank you.

In general, limits are per card per player.  So 2 protectors of Lorien would give you up to 6 activations, and multiple people could play Heavy Stroke off of the same attack.

 

Caleb (the designer) has specifically commented [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180521-desperate-alliance-and-once-per-phase/?p=1664213] on Desperate Alliance that the players as a group are only allowed to play one per phase.

Awesome, thanks for the link. This clarifies a lot. So now another thought I had while typing up this reply was: What if the original player who played Desperate Alliance dies during the phase due to Threat elimination? Does the Hero die at the end of the phase because he tries to go back to a dead player, or does he stay with the new owner?

Yeah, I'm not totally sure about Heavy Stroke tbh.  The people in the thread I linked seemed convinced that Caleb's comment only applied to Desperate Alliance, so that's what I went with.

The thread that Teamjimby linked asks the same questions but it didn't get asked offically.  Desperate Alliance is limit once per phase by card title: no other copies of that card (or recurrence of the same card) can be played within that same phase.  In Caleb's ruling, it did look to me like he was trying to limit the power of Desperate Alliance, rather than make a statement about the "limit" wording.

 

Now, this is nitpicky, but Desperate Alliance says "Limit 1 per phase," [not: "Limit 1 time per phase"] whereas Heavy Stroke says "Limit once per phase."  It could be that we are meant to understand "Limit 1" as "Limit 1 copy of this card per players as a group," while "Limit once" means "Limit one time for this copy of the card." 

 

The limit on Heavy Stroke is weird, since it is an event and you'd have to recur it to play it again.  Hama is your best way to recur it, and he was released just before Heavy Stroke, so it does seem pretty possible that the developers specifically had Hama in mind when they wrote this limit.

 

I write all this because I really don't think "Limit three times per phase," "Limit two times per phase," "Limit once per phase" are meant to apply to all copies of the card in a four-player game.  If that were the case, Protector of Lorien could only be triggered 3 times among 4 players.  Elven Spear would have the same problem.  You could only use one Rider of the Mark per round, even if you have 12 in play.  Longbeard Sentry could only be used once per phase, even if there are a bunch of them in play.

 

Basically I interpret Heavy Stroke's "Limit once per phase" as a way to prevent it from being recurred by Hama (it's not even that great of a card anyway, I think they were just trying to be careful).  Other than that, the text is pretty meaningless.

It's conceivable that the hero would stay, but doubt that was an intended possibility. Grandspleen sent in a question to Caleb, so we'll get an official ruling probably on Monday.

> I sent a question about limits though, not about what happens to a Desperate Alliance-d hero when their owner is eliminated.

 

 

I'm pretty sure someone in the CotR Discord chat asked Caleb this one directly, and the response was that at the end of the phase the hero returns to its owner and is immediately discarded. As entertaining as it would be to get one player to control six heroes (seven with Sword-thain!), this is probably the sane ruling. (Don't argue it too hard! I don't want Desperate Alliance getting nerfed. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

An answer today:

 

"Item 1.51 in the FAQ addresses “Limitations on card effects” as follows:

When a card with a trigger effect has a limit on the number of times that effect can be triggered (i.e. ‘Once per round,’ ‘Limit 3 times per phase,’ etc.), the limit is specific to that card. However, if a card has a limit of ‘once per game,’ that limitation is specific to the player who triggered it.

This ruling is pretty straight forward, so I think it’s the wording on Desperate Alliance and Heavy Stroke that creates the confusion. The “Limit 1 per phase” on Desperate Alliance was meant to limit the number of times a group could play the event each phase. Unfortunately, it doesn’t really do that the way it is printed. It should have been written: “No more than 1 copy of Desperate Alliance can be played each phase.” 
The same is true for Heavy Stroke: “No more than 1 copy of Heavy Stroke can be played each phase” would be the correct way to limit its use to once per phase, and that is how it should be played.
Cheers,
Caleb"

I'm a bit confused by this ruling.  Desperate alliance says "Limit 1 [one copy] per phase" whereas Heavy Stroke says "Limit once [one time] per phase". 

 

Doesn't that make Heavy Stroke more like Protector of Lorien and would fall in line with the bold portion of the ruling quoted?  I will play as if Heavy Stroke is only supposed to refer to one copy due to the ruling, but I honestly think that this didn't need to be limited as "once" by definition means "one time" not "one copy".

 

For example, none of these effects can be used by multiple players (or even a single player with multiple copies) if this ruling is correct:

 

1. Longbeard Sentry

2. Gondorian Fire

3. Blood of Numenor

4. Isengard Messenger

 

Edit: I see PocketWraiths comment now.  Heavy Stroke was simply incorrectly worded and should have the text "Limit 1 per phase" instead of "once".  Essentially, any event that says "once per X" should be worded to say "one per X" since "once per X" is entirely meaningless with respect to events.
