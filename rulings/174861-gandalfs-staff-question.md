# [Gandalf&#039;s Staff Question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174861-gandalfs-staff-question/)

I have a question about Gandalf's Staff.  If you choose the action "discard a shadow card from a non-unique enemy" you must discard the shadow card before you flip it, correct?  There is no time for an action between flipping the card and resolving any shadow effect it may have, correct?

 

Thank you for your help.

That's an interesting interpretation.  I've always treated it like an event card in that the bonus already triggered so discarding it does nothing.  This sounds like a question for Caleb.

I thought the intent of that rule is so that you don't accumulate shadow cards due to feint, etc.

 

Either way, I don't see a clear answer.  Sending an email to Caleb.

Looks like there was an official ruling 2 years ago that confirmed the shadow effect still happens even if you discard the card.  I think that is the more consistent rule interpretation.  I already sent an email to Caleb, so I'll let you all know if he says anything differently.

 

Alogos, please add that to the Q&A. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Edit: Caleb confirmed the previous ruling
