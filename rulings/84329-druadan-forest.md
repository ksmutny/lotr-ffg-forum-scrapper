Has the new expansion been spoiled or discussed somewhere? I'm asking because I picked it up yesterday (went to get the latest SWLCG pack and found out they had both the ANR and LOTR latest expansions as well). So, any question about it (haven't played it yet), just shoot.

there was some talk over on the rules forum so i just wanted to point out (incase some hadnt seen it) that the tower guard works with song card…..i asked about good meal and songs and caleb said that songs work fine so the same applies for him

also….i thought the harbour master was a female? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Good news about the songs/spheres then!  (makes sense since it doesn't appear that his game text cites "printed" spheres.

 

I hadn't seen the pictures of the new cards prior to posting my thoughts about the card… lol
