what do we all think? ……..much needed development? or not?

i know i posted about the game's difficulty but i dont think i will do this- it feels like cheating…(read that last comment very carefully please)

well sort of. i guess it is a good idea though and i congratulate the designers on doing this.

PS. i may as well say this outloud so im not spending my day tomorrow with pointless arguments- this is a great thing for the game….i just personally wont use it (at least i dont think so….time will tell)

it's funny, i was just joking w/my buddies how the FFG forums will have a post about how the easy mode is "cheating" - and here it is! ;D

this is nothing but a positive. video games do this. i don't know of many of other game formats that have variable difficulty. it's one more sign that the game designers actually listen to the fan base. there are now three modes to play the game. it seems silly to me, especially after all the complaints about the "difficulty" of the game, to now complain that, once the designers have addressed the issue, that it's "cheating."

props to caleb et al for listening and really putting a lot of effort into the game to make it better. we now have a great way to introduce the newer quests to new players - maybe not always having to rely on Passage Through Mirkwood, or some other similarly simple quest.

perhaps you need to re read my post, so you dont end up a repeat of your last infamous post by insulting another fellow gamer. im not arguing here. the basic fact is that to me it FEELS like cheating, hence i said i doubt id use it.

of course it isnt- thats the whole point of ffg making this official rules

therefore thats why i added the last about congratulating the designers. the introduction of this is only a good thing, but to me im not so sure about it

It's funny to see how some of the cards that are removed to achieve easy mode are the 'iconic' cards of that expansion/encounter set.
Chieftain Ufthak, Marsh Adder, Hummerhorn, majority of Hunters from Mordor, most of trechery from Rhosgobel, Mumakil, Old Tomnnody, etc.

But it's always good to have more option to play.
I don't think Easy Mode is cheating, especially since it is an official variant posted by the developers,
and I could actually see myself using this mode.

Play standard mode when playing a new quest,
Play nightmare mode when playing with a finely-tuned cutting-edge deck,
Play easy mode when playing a Cycle of quests using thematic decks.

Edit: Just realized I didin't explain why I think easy mode is 'legetimate' way to play.
I would probably dismiss this easy mode as 'cheating' as well if it was fanmade variant.
Only reason I would consider it otherwise and actually give it a try myself is that it came from the developers,
and even then I might have dismissed the easy mode as 'temporary fix' to quiet the increasing complaints about difficulty.
But Caleb and other developers are doing such a good job with LotRLCG that I am trusting this easy mode is a 'balanced' way of reducing difficulty to enable players to try out thematic decks… and I've been playing without Denethor for too long.

i know exactly what you said. and i know you weren't dissing the designers. i was merely giving my opinion by stating that this is in no way cheating (much in the same way i never thought not using shadow cards your first couple play-throughs was cheating). it was tongue-in-cheek. and there is nothing in my post (at least, i don't think) suggesting i was going to argue.

Thank you Caleb and FFG for "Easy Mode". This is a fantastic option for the game. If want to use it, it's there for you. If you don't, you can still play the game as normal. Perfect.
