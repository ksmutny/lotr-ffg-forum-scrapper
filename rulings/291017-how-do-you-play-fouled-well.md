Fouled Well reads: "When Revealed: Each player may choose and discard 1 card at random from his hand. If all players did not discard 1 card, Fouled Well gains Surge."

I interpret this as "if at least one player randomly discards a card, surge will not happen". Is this correct?

I asked Caleb about this and he confirmed, all players have to discard a random card. Since this is not, how I interpret the current text, I will errata my copies to: "If any player discarded no card, Fouled Well gains Surge."
