Unless we get them both in pack 6, it also appears that we will not be getting leadership and spirit guarded cards. A leadership guarded enemy card that focuses on defense could have really helped out Dunedain. We also still don't have any more Rohan cards as Caleb said she would. Pack 6 will have to have it.

Where did Caleb mention that we were getting more Rohan cards?

The last time he was on Cardtalk, which was after Challenge of the Wainriders hit, he said that they are really trying to make Rohan a top tier archetype this cycle and that the new cards that are yet unspoiled will help with that. At the moment, the main thing they need is healing. We got some needed card draw already.
