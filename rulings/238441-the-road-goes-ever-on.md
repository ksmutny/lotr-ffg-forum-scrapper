Happy New 2017 to everyone!

I thought it was the right time to start off on an LCG blog/session report/variant/experiment - yes, I'm not sure what exactly to call this right now, but here's the background...

I have been playing the game on and off since it came out and have a fair collection of expansions and packs to go with my Core game - everything through 'Shadows of Mirkwood', 'Khazad-dum' and then patchy from there - a few deluxe boxes (Isengard, Heroes of Numenor, Lost Realm), some Saga boxes (the first Hobbit and Black Riders) and some adventure packs here and there.

So, a fair few cards...

I'm also almost exclusively a solo player that likes to build theme into decks and quests.

So what I'm proposing on my (rather unexpected) journey is going way back to the start and trying each Quest solo with just the card pool that was available at the time.

But because I have a bit of experience with the game, then I know that this would be very frustrating doing it as it stands and without a bit of 'customisation' on my part.

I've been playing around with various solo tweaks over the last 2 weeks and think I've probably got most of the game balance issues right for me.

So this is how I'm going to do it and playing solo 1 handed with 3 Heroes:

1) 1 Core Set only - no multiple power cards like 'Unexpected Courage' I'm afraid.

2) Playing with just the cards that were available at the time (not sure what I'm going to do with the Saga cards just yet - I'll cross that bridge when I get to it - lets hope it's more a Brandywine bridge than Moria!!)

3) Playing in Easy Mode - so reduced encounter card pool and 2 Resources per Hero at the start. I'm also drawing 6 cards, allowing a single Mulligan and then choosing a card from the remaining deck to be my 7th card - the first card drawn on the first round.

4) Making decks that areas thematic as possible that fit within the quests - no Eagles in Moria for example - although the Hero gene pool might get a bit mixed up if Tolkien fans look too hard!

5) I'm making a few concessions to the solo player as I feel that, certainly initially, the game was never a balanced solo experience.

So my additions are going to be:

a) Ranged and Sentinel - yes, those old favourites! I'm going with:

Ranged: Exhaust a Character with Ranged to resolve their Attack (before Step 1 of Combat Phase begins but after Shadow card is dealt) when you optionally engage an Enemy.

Sentinel: Exhaust a Character with Sentinel to add that Character's Defence to another Character.

b) Starting Boons - I'm going to create 8 Boons - all Neutral cards (but with Sphere bonuses)and a player chooses 1 Boon for each Hero at the start of the game. The Boons are all 'one shots' ie discard the Boon to get the bonus. There are no duplicated Boons either, so 3 different ones in play:

Boons:
1. Lucky Strike (Tactics) - gain +2 Attack until end of phase (+3 Attack if attached to a Tactics Hero)
2. Dodge (Tactics) - gain +2 Defence until end of phase (+3 Defence if attached to a Tactics Hero)
3. Far Sight (Spirit) - gain +2 Willpower until end of phase (+3 Willpower if attached to a Spirit Hero)
4. Hidden (Spirit) - reduce your Threat by 2 (3 if attached to a Spirit Hero)
5. Healing Balm (Lore) - Heal 2 Hit points on 1 Character (3 if attached to a Lore Hero).
6. Wisdom (Lore) - Draw 2 cards (3 if attached to a Lore Hero)
7. Inspiration (Leadership) - gain 2 Resources (3 if attached to a Leadership Hero)
8. Resolve (Leadership) - ready any 2 Heroes (3 if attached to a Leadership Hero).

It's up to a player what Boons he chooses so he could give his Tactics Hero extra Attack/Defence, although I think it would be better for a solo player, to 'fill in the gaps' of his party, so if I was playing without Lore, I might want to choose Inspiration or Resolve as these are what Lore does naturally. Similarly, if I had no Spirit Hero then I would choose Far Sight or Hidden.

BTW - if anyone would like to make these Boon cards a physical reality - I'm rubbish with Photoshop and just am an ideas man! - then I'd welcome your help!!

c) Havens - More about these later - but I'm nicking another idea from Gizlivadi....

Glad to see my idea of Haven cards still alive! The fact that pretty much all cards of the Location type in this game are considered encounter and thus "evil" (or else some weird Objective like Minas Tirith) is IMO a thematic problem of the basic structure of the game. Simply put, this game should have good locations, period. I like the idea of player locations where you can put allies that don't necessarily have to go in your company and can do work "from afar" like Miner/Stargazer or Master of the Forge, and that was one of the main thematic principles of Haven cards. The problem with that basic design idea is that, sadly, the game game has gotten so relentless and punishing that you just can't afford to play an ally in a Haven (even if the cost was 0) who could instead be a chump-blocker. Your Thrandui's Halls prototype, for instance, is just no use in a solo game. Giving Ranged does nothing, and the first ability, you have to ask ¿why would I do that? ¿Why would I return a silvan ally played at the Haven to my hand? ¿So I can play it in my main party next round? ¿Then why didn't you just play in with the party to begin with? So, for the Havens the main thing is that the benefits you get should compensate for not having a potential chump-blocker or archery receiving ally in play. On the other hand, having all allies played there cost -1 and be neutral can lead to heavy abuse, as I could just play a huge ally in my Haven, then have it travel and in 1 turn (which compensates for the -1 cost) I can have a huge out of sphere ally in my main party that I wouldn't be able to play otherwise. Sure, for some of the utility allies it doesn't really matter, but if I'm playing mono-Tactics being able to just have Gildor or Arwen at neutral cost really trivializes the handicaps player decks should have (kinda like starting the game with a completed slightly worse The Storm Comes, which would already be overpowered). I do like, however, having resources on the Havens, I think you can play a lot with that idea (in my original version the cost for Haven abilities was exhausting the allies at the Haven).

 

I'm not trying to be pessimistic, I'm just stating the problems I encountered when testing my own Haven cards. I still think, however, that there's a balanced way to make these work, I just haven't quite come up with it yet. I hope one day that we get official "good" locations in the game, so hopefully Caleb's looking at this thread!

I still think that solo play (1 handed) is really difficult without a huge card pool, so this is my way of 'softening' the game a little for me as I go along the journey.
