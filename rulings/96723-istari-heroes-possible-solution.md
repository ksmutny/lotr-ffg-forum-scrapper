I posted the following idea in the Ent deck, but decided to immediately make a new thread for this since it's more likely Caleb would read it  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

The issue of Wizard heroes has existed since this game began. The main problem this poses is that of the difficulty of design since they'd have to strike a delicate balance between being playable and overpowered. Current ally versions of some wizards, like Gandalf or Saruman, have amazing stats and powerful abilities, but they're often considered "secondary" characters in the game and they're often one-time-use characters per copy (barring Sneak Attack, of course). So the question is, how could they make Istari heroes that are comparable to their ally versions without being overpowered? Should they have lower stats? one-time-use abilities? and so on.

 

Well, what I thought of (inspired by an idea Shipwreck wrote in the ent thread) is that the "condition" tu run Istari heroes is that they'd have to be "solo" heroes, that is, the only hero you could have in your deck. Since using only one hero means that if you lose it you lose the game, their stats would have to compensate for that. They should have really high stats and awesome abilities to be able to replace their ally versions (without being strictly better) but at the same time they'd have to have really high threat, as much as any other normal deck would have. This makes a lot of sense thematically, since being a wizard is probably the most "dangerous" race to be, since they're the direct enemies of Sauron. They were also, for the most part, lone wanderers, so it makes sense IMO that they should have this restriction of not being able to have more heroes at their side (in solo games at least).

 

Now, the only one reason I can see for dismissing the idea of making wizard heroes, is that this game so far seems to be focused on "the little people" of Middle earth. Wizards in this game are for the most part represented as occasional helpers and crutches for the rest of the heroes to do their part, so that would be a reason not to make wizard heroes. That's a pretty valid route, though very dissapointing to me (I really want wizard heroes!), but at the same time, when you have heroes such as Galadriel, Elrond and Celeborn (who were in some sense wizards or sorcerers, or at least very powerful magical beings) you really start to wonder what reason do they have to make those and not the wizards.

 

There's also the problem of uniqueness. If you run a hero Gandalf in multiplayer, your friends will not be able to play the ally version of Gandalf. That is troublesome, yes, but it's also the case with Hobbit saga Gandalf and Core Gandalf, and yet both of those exist. Plus, when you think about the current state of the game and also the future, you start to see that Core Gandalf is becoming increasingly less essential to decks, and to me the only decks that really must include Gandalf are the ones that cannot otherwise reduce threat. This problem will be solved the more effects they make to reduce threat.

 

The final design problem is the one of spheres. Which sphere would you include each wizard in? Should they make a new "Istari" sphere? To be honest I can't really offer a solution to this, but I still think they can find a way around it. Maybe they could pay for cards of any sphere BUT you can only include cards from up to two different spheres in your deck (you choose)? 

 

The idea of wizard heroes also opens up a lot possibilities. How cool would it be if each one had different characteristics, such as one being better at combat, the other having lower starting threat than the others, the other producing more resources than the other, etc. That would be a very exciting new mechanic to make this game more complete, IMO.

 

So what do you think? Do you even want to see Istari heroes? Do you think it would be too troublesome to design? Do you not care? Please write your opinions about this and hopefully let's open up some debate and maybe, just maybe, we could inspire designers to make something radically new for this game.

My $0.02:

 

One major premise of the thread seems to be how to accurately represent the "power" of an Istari in a hero card format and still make him balanced against other heroes.  I suggest that the "power" of a character matters little in the end.  What matters is thematically scaling them with the other heroes.  Example:

 

Aragorn fights 3x better than Beregond?

Bilbo defends himself better than Glorfindel? (Really?)

 

I think if Caleb wanted to represent an Istari as a hero it would just be a matter of getting the stats proportioned correctly.  Higher than average stats with higher than average threat is common enough.  And remember, for as powerful as many people percieve Gandalf to be, I'd bet on Glorfindel in a matchup.  He did kill a Balrog and return from the dead too.  And the Nazgul soiled themselves on sight of him. The ally Gandalf has stats to reflect his extremely temporary nature.

Distractionbeast: That's also a pretty valid point, and an option that we may still get from the developers. Wizards could just be like all the other heroes, without special restrictions. The thing is, when you look at the ally versions of Gandalf, you see that they are at least much more powerful than regular heroes, and while most of them could be equivalent in power at least to Glorfindel, that still poses an issue of power creep, since now you have 5 new Glorfindels without special restrictions, which is maybe not something Caleb wants to repeat. That's why I think it's better that the Istari should be special heroes with pretty much their own new set of rules. However, if they do decide to make Istari heroes like you said, as "regular" heroes but better than average, I'm all for it, but as most people I was just being careful about the power creep.
