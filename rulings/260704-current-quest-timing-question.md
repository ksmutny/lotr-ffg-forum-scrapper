I'm about to try NM Carrock for first time. Setup says...

Forced: At the end of the quest phase, if no progress was placed on the current quest this phase, place 1 progress on the current quest (bypassing the active location).

So my thought is to use side quests to stall the process, but it got me thinking. If I select a side quest to be the current quest and it's completed, does the main quest now become the current quest and I'd still have to put 1 progress on it?

When you select a side quest to be the current quest, it lasts until end of phase, so not sure in the timing... or if I'm overthinking it and even completed, the one I picked is still the current quest and no progress is added.

Anyone know?

Good thoughts. I've sent a message to Caleb as it seems rather murky.

Looks like naverag is right. Caleb's response...

 

A side quest is only considered the “current quest” until the end of the phase, so the main quest would once again be considered the current quest as soon as the end of the phase triggers. Since the ability in question triggers “at the end of the quest phase” that means the main quest is the current quest for the purpose of resolving its effect. Therefore, you must place 1 progress on the main quest even if you placed progress on a side quest that round.
