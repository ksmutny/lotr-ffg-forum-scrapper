You may think it would be fairly easy to then get up to 9 with allies but the thing is the vast majority of allies are going to be the same trait as the heroes in a deck so for this example I've already given you would need something like a Rohan, Gondor and Ent ally in play alongside those heroes with the 6 traits. In the example FFG gave just Denethor and Elfhelm alone give you 6 traits but both of them have 3 each and there are not that many heroes that have 3 each the vast majority only have one or two.

You know the cardgame took a wrong turn when building a deck around the *actual* fellowship of the ring is considered unthematic. Which the designers obviously are trying to remedy in this cycle. We've already seen a couple of cross-trait cards and I'm getting the feeling that they'll try to push players out of the single-trait deckbuilding.

 

It's interesting that originally the game was designed around spheres and the idea that, like the book, different people would come together to stand against the darkness. Ever since we've had the Dwarves though, fans have requested all traits to be viable. I still think it's sad that 'thematic' is a term used to describe single-trait decks and 'unthematic' is used for cross-trait decks. Especially since a big part of the Lotr story is about characters from all walks of life overcoming their inward view and learning to respect each other and work together.

 

No matter how hard Caleb is going to try, the most thematic pairing in the game is Zigil Miner and Imladris Stargazer. These two interact in a way that feels exactly like Gimli and Legolas did in the books: they don't *need*  each other to work, yet together they achieve amazing things. #bestlovestoryinlotrlcg

There was no Steward of Gondor nor anyone from Rohan in the fellowship.

I actually disagree quite strongly on this point.

There are definitely combinations that are thematic but just throwing together some heroes and saying its thematic because all the free peoples had to unite to stand against the darkness to me is really silly.

There was one fellowship.... not multiple ones.. there was ONE group of diverse characters that set out as the fellowship.

Dwarf and Elf relations continued to be pretty absymal in the third age (Gimli and Legolas are the only exception to this).

Denethor doesn't even except that help will come when the beacons are lit. The dunedain act secretly and on their own in the shadows to protect the people of the Shire, Bree and the surrounding areas.

Remember the LAST alliance of Elves and Men, it was exactly that a last alliance where they marched together. We do not see that in the Third Age outside of Legoland and Gimli. Contrary to Peter Jackson's nonsense there were no Elves at Helms Deep.

Yes part of the story is about a group of characters from a diverse range of backgrounds and races coming together to form a fellowship but other than the fellowship itself most of the races and groups of people in middle earth are actually quite wary and/or dismissive of other races. Hell the people of Bree and surrounding areas are mistrustful and scared of the Dunedain Rangers which are the only thing keeping them safe.

So yes a fellowship line-up is thematic, yes a three hunters deck is thematic. Merry pippin and treebeard is thematic. Hell you could even say that Rohan and Treebeard (and Ent allies and whatnot) are thematic when playing the Isengard Saga Box as the Ents and Huorns destroyed the fleeing uruk-hai after Helm's deep and assaulted Orthanc. They don't actually fight alongside each other but do have a common foe and both fought great battles in Rohan at the same time. A Gandalf deck heavy on eagles you could call thematic considering his connection and friendship with them. Also cross trait decks can be thematic too so long as it is people that actually did work together in some way. A Dunedain/Noldor mix is thematic. As is a Silvan/Noldor mix, a Rohan/Gondor mix or even Dwarf/Hobbit can be considered thematic.

Throwing Boromir, Galadriel and Hama in a deck that has Ent and Eagle allies because they all work well together and it is a strong no nonsense deck is all well and fine. But it is not a thematic deck by any stretch of the imagination. None of these characters fought together or were even in the same place very long or at all.

Also just to be clear I'm not saying people SHOULD play thematic decks people can use whatever they want in this game which is part of why its so amazing. A hero line up or decks are not thematic just because a diverse group of characters are included though.

Also if you hunt around on the forums you would realise that it seems to be fairly accepted that the ultimate thematic way to play the game is to play campaign mode using only characters that were actually part of each scenario/quest and changing the line up following this rule as you go. These are decks built around the fellowship so your statement that decks built around the actual fellowship are considered unthematic is literally the opposite of the actual truth. Nothing is more thematic than a fellowship deck.

That is the actual fellowship however.... Your own version of the fellowship with Na'aisayah, Theoden, Erestor, Halbarad and Long dead Bard the Bowman/Dwalin is definitely not thematic just because it is a large group of peoples and traits coming together/fighting together.

Does it matter if your decks are unthematic though? Those who are actual sticklers for this and/or tolkien enthusiasts that want to use thematic decks will do so. Those who do not care so much will not.

While I don't necessarily disagree with this (a Three Hunters deck IMO is indeed one of the pinnacles of thematic decks in this game), I am really bugged when people bring this up over and over again. Why? Because by this reasoning every build and combination is thematic. Which is ALSO true, because this is a thematic game in a general sense. Everything about it is designed to be thematic in the first place, so it feels like a tautology when people say "but the theme of LOTR is different cultures coming together so any combination of traits is thematic". Well, yeah, but that's a characteristic of the entire game. It's not like we're gonna see lightsabers or Sauron-aligned player cards or something actually unthematic in a general sense. So why state the obvious? When people say thematic or unthematic it's because they wanna differentiate between decks that grab characters all over Middle Earth and decks that keep characters that belong to the same  realm or might have known each other. Sure, thematic is not the word to call it, but it seems you're forgetting that, by your definition, pretty much everything (except maybe Eagles in Moria, etc) is designed to be thematic because that's the whole point of the game; there are no "unthematic" possible lineups in this game by your definition just like there are no unthematic possible business-related outcomes in Monopoly. So, the word is useless, either change the definition or don't use it at all.
