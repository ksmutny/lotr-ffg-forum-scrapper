 Okay, so I initially posted this by mistake in the Strategy & deckbuilding forum, and I was recommended to just post it again in the general forum to maybe get more replies. So, here it is, with some additions: 

I will begin this rant saying I've recently picked up this game,though I knew of its existence as soon as it was announced. At the time, however, I was busy playing Decipher's Lotr, and before that I was playing ICE's Middle Earth CCG. So, as you can see, I've enjoyed and experienced all Lotr-themed CCG's made to date and I picked this one up mainly because of the solo play factor and because it just looked like a good game (and it is). However, as a devoted Tolkien fan, I keep seeing some flaws in this LCG. I don't mind the non-canon characters, in fact I enjoy seeing them (Meccg had lots), so that's not the problem I have with this game. The thing that bothers me is how they've made the culture/race/faction spread. I think it looks rather disorganized and it seems like cards are just disconected from each other. What I'm saying here is that, for example, all Rohan cards don't really look like they belong in a particular culture/faction; another example would be Gondor. All these groups of cards, since they're spread in all spheres of influence, have this lore/aesthetical feel of being kind of disconnected, and frankly, I think that the creators of the game don't put much thought when naming and creating the concept of certain cards, or at least when placing them in a particular sphere or set. If the game right now supposedly takes place in the 17-year period before Frodo leaves the Shire, what is a card named Gildor's Counsel, with that particular art and flavor text doing in a set called The Hills of Emyn Muil? What is Gildor even doing there? (Note that I think both these cards were well made, Gildor's card feels like him and the lore behind them was very well thought, it's the fact that they're so misplaced that bugs me.) I could list lots of other examples. Everything about the card's lore and concept feels just so scattered, so out of place. Why did they decide to put Boromir in the Dead Marshes set, and Imrahil in A Journey to Rhosgobel; and Dúnhere, a character we read so little of, in the Core Set? There just seems to be so little reasoning behind the placing of each culture's cards and it looks like they just choose a random character and toss him in a random set, if you understand what I'm saying. And the main problem I this brings in my opinion is a big unbalance between races/cultures. One can't build, say, a consistent, coherent Gondor-themed deck without including at least three spheres of influence, and sometimes only one card of a particular sphere. There are other minor bugs I have with the game, like the "Istari" and "Dúnedain" keywords, and anachronic references to the "Necromancer", that show that the developers didn't make further research on these matters, but again, those are minor details.

I think that maybe this will all be fixed when we get more sets and get to the proper Lotr novels, but then I think another problem may arise. I really enjoyed Decipher's Lotr. The fact that the cards were in fact divided by culture (Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, etc) made it just feel better organized and "tribal" without it being that it was "necessarily tribal", or that you couln't mix and splash cultures as you wished when building a deck, but it gave a better visual flavor than just the word "Dwarf" written above the ability. However, what I didn't like about that game (though I think it couln't be helped) was the dozens of versions each character had. Will we get this too in Lotr LCG? It seems likely, being that we already have two versions of a bunch of characters already. When we get to the Lotr novels, will we get another Bilbo, or yet another Aragorn, for example? Or maybe (and I hope this was the case) we won't and they decided to put Bilbo early in THFG to make it unnecessary to make another in future sets. I don't know. Also, the fact that characters are divided in heroes and allies also helps the possibility of many version of the same character. I honestly hope that we'll see at most two cards for each character. More, in my opinion, wouldn't be necessary and feels like it kills the character's "uniqueness".

So I believe most of you now think that I hate this game or something like that. I don't. I love it, I like the gameplay, the very concept of the quest card, the illustrations, the visual design, etc. Enough to keep me playing it. It's just some lore and design things that really bother (or maybe will bother) me, and I was wondering if anyone else has felt something similar about them.

Also, I make mistakes with my Enlgish. It's not my first language and sometimes I confuse things.

I had written a long post but accidentally lost it (backed out of combox). To summarize, as long as a new "version" of a hero (or ally, I'd like to see a hero version of Faramir, and several other ally cards at some point…) doesn't "kill" or make obsolete the old version (as Rich said) I don't see a problem. Many of the heroes of Middle Earth are very complex characters and have different sides to their personalities. Aragorn is both a leader and a lore-keeper (also a warrior [self-evident] and healer [houses of healing], perhaps we shall see a version of him for each sphere in the future). Glorfindel likewise is both a healer and warrior as one FFG employee (Caleb?) noted when the new version was released.

Furthermore characters develop and change over the course of their lives. This seems to be seen in the new, "young Bilbo" from TH Saga has no threat (he's inexperienced), compared to the old, "old (redundant?) Bilbo" from tHfG who is weaker (2 HP instead of 3; after all, he's older), but much more experienced (unusually high threat), and has card draw (i.e. "tricks"  up his sleeve?). Caleb also discussed how (and why) the new Gandalf in TH Saga differs from the old Gandalf in Core in a recent blog post. I think having this variety (again as long as it doesn't kill other "versions" of characters) will turn out to be very useful (FFG will just have to be certain to add a rule about only being able to use one x name card in play at a time, if they haven't yet).

But no I don't want a dozen of any characters, I don't see a purpose to that…

Well put! I was so put out that I needed to write my long post again, due to unknown error, but so gratefull that you just wrote basically what my point was. The whole thing about characters developing through their lifes thus legitimate a couple of different versions of the same heroes. Of cause no one wants 10 different versions of Aragon ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Loragon, ok, but a Tactigon just sounds more like Transformers ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] though a Strider would be nice.
