Hey LOTR lore masters, I was wondering if the Fastred spirit hero from The Black Serpent is an existing character or if he was an invention of Fantasy Flight. I was going to start a "campaign" run through of all the adventure packs with the self imposed restriction of only using the characters that aren't canon, but am unsure whether Fastred qualifies or not. Also Haldan from Roam Across from Rhovanion. Help please.

Haldan is FFG-created, while Fastred is actually a bit of a grey area. A Fastred is mentioned in the Song of the Mounds of Mundburg (listing heroes who died in the Battle of the Pelannor Fields) but he's no more than a name ('Herefara and Herubrand, Horn and Fastred,
fought and fell there in a far country'). But Fasted was also the name of Theoden's great uncle, who died fighting the Haradrim with his Gondorion allies. So I think it's Caleb showing off his knowledge of the lore in making a nod to original. Of course, very natural to name someone after a famous fallen hero, so I that's how I imagine it. Whether the LCG character is the same Fastred that rode with Theoden, I think it's left open for you to interpret either way.

No, you're right, it definitely COULDN'T have been Theoden's great-uncle Fastred (well, following the LCG timeline); I never said it could. I said it could or could not be the Fastred who rode WITH Theoden (to Pelannor). I tend to think it is intended as such, but since Caleb hasn't said and we have next to no knowledge of that character, it also seems possible it could be a 'random' Fastred, as it were. Basically, that HirumeShiruge has grounds for including or not including him as an FFG created hero.

Sorry, I had misinterpreted what you wrote.

But still, there's noting to suggest that this is a FFG-created hero. There's no accompanying backstory, which has been the standard for non-canon heroes for a long time. And they've never named a non-canon hero by the same name as a character in the canon. By the same token, how do we know Eowyn isn't just a 'random' Eowyn?
