 This is something I've been pondering for a while, and can't seem to find a definitive answer for

 

Are heroes player cards?

 

for example, can Legolas put progress tokens on the Carrock, can Core Set Glorfindel heal Beorn or Bilbo when he's in the riddling area (with Elrond boosting the power of that healing)
