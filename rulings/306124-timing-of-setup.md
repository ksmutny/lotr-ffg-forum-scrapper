There are several "Setup" in the game now——Contract cards like "Messenger of the King"/"The Grey Wanderer" , other player cards like Thurindir/The One Ring , and also quest cards. But when did these effect triggers? Before the players draw their openning hands , or after ?
    Some cards, like Gandalf's Delay ,should be trigger before player draw their hands and mulligan, but how about Thurindir? Should he search for the side quest  and draw the other 5 cards? If so , how to take mulligan ?
    If the "Setup" effect triggers after the players draw their hands , If they get the Ally/Attachment for "Messenger of the King"/"The Grey Wanderer" in the openning hand, do that means they had to prepare a Plan B ?

I once got a ruling from Caleb about Thurindir along the lines of: You place your heroes before drawing your starting hand, therefore you first search your deck for a side quest, then draw 6 cards. If you decide to take a mulligan you only shuffle "these 6 cards back into your deck" and keep the side quest in hand.

Card Talk just released an interview with Caleb & Matt during which Grey Wanderer's Setup timing is discussed. Essentially, they reconfirmed that the timing is as previously ruled—after encounter setup—with some further discussion that implied to my ears that Caleb is not considering reversing the ruling, or making any of the individual contracts have different Setup timing or anything like that. But y'all should listen for yourselves.

In addition to a ruling to @kainveus [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/187846-kainveus/] shared elsewhere [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277776-unofficial-official-rulings-thread/?do=findComment&comment=3906218], there is this short and sweet one obtained by Card Talk Dave:



> The One Ring's Setup effect should be resolved with all the other Setup effects during Step 7.

I asked him about this ruling in light of the most recent one and he explicitely answered me that the current ruling ovverules any past one, so right now Thurindir (and other heroes setup effects I guess) should happen at step 7 after the scenario setup.

Of course, keep in mind that this was a follow up question after the one which placed all player cards Setup in Step 7

But why would Permanent boons be any different?  The Black Riders booklet says that all boon cards in the campaign pool are added to players' decks.  While it does say that you fish out the permanent ones and attach them to your hero "at the start of the game," but isn't any more specific than that.  The Shadow in the East booklet explicitly says to attach the One Ring to a hero in Step 2, and that's been over ridden by this latest ruling, so why wouldn't this? Caleb has been very explicit that (1) he doesn't remember all his past rulings AND (2) what he has said now about all player cards with Set-Up effects overrules all other rulings, including those explicitly printed in rules inserts to the contrary (e.g. the Master Ring) and long-standing FAQ/RulesAnswers to the contrary (e.g. Thurindir).  I now see no reason to assume that Campaign Boons, permament are not, are fished from decks at any time other than Step 7 with all the other set-up stuff.

Which means by the end of a campaign, the odds of ending up with a really bad (read: small) starting hand go up, especially if you use heroes like Thurindir or Contracts like Grey Wanderer / Messenger of the King, and heroes like Galdor become unusable ... especially assuming that you cannot play set-up cards like Boons or the One Ring if they are in the discard pile... but we still don't have a clear answer on that.

Basically, Set-Up effects are a total disaster now and have become, as others have noted, unintuitive, frustrating, and tedious.

You can try and submit this question to Caleb, see how it answers...

I feel like the powers that be have commanded Caleb to not rest until we have to shuffle decks at least ten times before we actually get to play Turn 1...  I think this is just Asmodee trying to increase the sale of card sleeves...  🤷‍♂️

I am engaging in a long back and forth with Caleb about this issue, and he might consider reversing his ruling and going back to the previous handling of player Setup effects. I will keep you posted.

Caleb says he will take some time to check all the rules/rulings again when he has all his material available (since right now he is not going to the office to work) and look at the whole matter again.

One thing he said is that if you Grey Wanderer a Guarded attachment which get some stuff out of the encounter deck which is then put aside during the quest card setup he would imagine that the Guarded attachment is put aside with the encounter card.

A grey wanderer guarded card at step 2 is still problematic.  You can easily discard some cards that don't fit the guarded requirements that the quest cards will tell you to search the encounter deck for and you've already reached a null state.  You can still "cheat" guarded cards in for free in quests like Watcher in the Water 1B where you add cards into the staging area until there is X [Threat].  I feel like they're a host of many other quest-specific problems but I can't think of them all off the top of my head.

There is a ruling you can make to fix these issues, avoiding the much abhorred errata of a new card (which is way more of a taboo to designers than players) or disastrous Set-Up changes.  In step 2, when Side A instructs you to put it into play, just sit the guarded card in the staging area.  Then, at the end of step 7, when the quest is set-up and ready, deal it a guarded card.  It's a little wonky, but it fixes every problem and I think it is the truest implementation of how everything is supposed to work.

The easiest way, already suggested by lot of people in this forum and which I put to Caleb's attention, to avoid this problem is to put a "no Guarded" restriction to the attachment played through The Grey Wanderer.

Setup for contracts should still happen in step 2, it only makes sense and changing it to step 7 messes everything up. I strongly disagree with Caleb's ruling and hope he changes it back-we can of course play how we want but this just annoys me knowing a poor ruling was made that should now be "official". As for Grey Wanderer simply say search your deck for a 1 cost attachment and set it aside, put it into play at the end of setup. There, now there is no issue with any scenario's setup or guarded cards since there wasn't a problem to begin with as there was an encounter deck by step 2.
