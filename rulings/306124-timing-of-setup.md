There are several "Setup" in the game now——Contract cards like "Messenger of the King"/"The Grey Wanderer" , other player cards like Thurindir/The One Ring , and also quest cards. But when did these effect triggers? Before the players draw their openning hands , or after ?
    Some cards, like Gandalf's Delay ,should be trigger before player draw their hands and mulligan, but how about Thurindir? Should he search for the side quest  and draw the other 5 cards? If so , how to take mulligan ?
    If the "Setup" effect triggers after the players draw their hands , If they get the Ally/Attachment for "Messenger of the King"/"The Grey Wanderer" in the openning hand, do that means they had to prepare a Plan B ?

I once got a ruling from Caleb about Thurindir along the lines of: You place your heroes before drawing your starting hand, therefore you first search your deck for a side quest, then draw 6 cards. If you decide to take a mulligan you only shuffle "these 6 cards back into your deck" and keep the side quest in hand.

Card Talk just released an interview with Caleb & Matt during which Grey Wanderer's Setup timing is discussed. Essentially, they reconfirmed that the timing is as previously ruled—after encounter setup—with some further discussion that implied to my ears that Caleb is not considering reversing the ruling, or making any of the individual contracts have different Setup timing or anything like that. But y'all should listen for yourselves.

In addition to a ruling to @kainveus [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/187846-kainveus/] shared elsewhere [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277776-unofficial-official-rulings-thread/?do=findComment&comment=3906218], there is this short and sweet one obtained by Card Talk Dave:



> The One Ring's Setup effect should be resolved with all the other Setup effects during Step 7.

I asked him about this ruling in light of the most recent one and he explicitely answered me that the current ruling ovverules any past one, so right now Thurindir (and other heroes setup effects I guess) should happen at step 7 after the scenario setup.

Of course, keep in mind that this was a follow up question after the one which placed all player cards Setup in Step 7

But why would Permanent boons be any different?  The Black Riders booklet says that all boon cards in the campaign pool are added to players' decks.  While it does say that you fish out the permanent ones and attach them to your hero "at the start of the game," but isn't any more specific than that.  The Shadow in the East booklet explicitly says to attach the One Ring to a hero in Step 2, and that's been over ridden by this latest ruling, so why wouldn't this? Caleb has been very explicit that (1) he doesn't remember all his past rulings AND (2) what he has said now about all player cards with Set-Up effects overrules all other rulings, including those explicitly printed in rules inserts to the contrary (e.g. the Master Ring) and long-standing FAQ/RulesAnswers to the contrary (e.g. Thurindir).  I now see no reason to assume that Campaign Boons, permament are not, are fished from decks at any time other than Step 7 with all the other set-up stuff.

Which means by the end of a campaign, the odds of ending up with a really bad (read: small) starting hand go up, especially if you use heroes like Thurindir or Contracts like Grey Wanderer / Messenger of the King, and heroes like Galdor become unusable ... especially assuming that you cannot play set-up cards like Boons or the One Ring if they are in the discard pile... but we still don't have a clear answer on that.

Basically, Set-Up effects are a total disaster now and have become, as others have noted, unintuitive, frustrating, and tedious.

You can try and submit this question to Caleb, see how it answers...

> Just watched a snippet of that video.  It seems Gandalf's delay is the *ONLY* card that's supposed to take place out of Step 7 Set-up.  So you definitely CAN draw permanent boons.  Does that also mean Gildor Inglorion (Boon) and other boons/burdens don't get shuffled into the Encounter Deck until after the Quest set-up is resolved?  I guess that depends on the order of set-up instructions in Step 7?  I think I'm confusing myself now.


I feel like the powers that be have commanded Caleb to not rest until we have to shuffle decks at least ten times before we actually get to play Turn 1...  I think this is just Asmodee trying to increase the sale of card sleeves...  🤷‍♂️


🤣... 😂 ... 😭 ... 😥 ... ☹️ ... 💀
