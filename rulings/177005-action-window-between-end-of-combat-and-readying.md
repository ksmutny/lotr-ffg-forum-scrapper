# [Action Window between End of Combat and Readying](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177005-action-window-between-end-of-combat-and-readying/)

I played a game last night where we had Watchful Eyes attached to Denethor, and the idea was suggested to use Denethor's action after the "end of the combat phase" but before characters ready.  Does such an action window exist?  I thought no, but everyone else said yes.  My thinking is that readying happens in the refresh phase before you can take any actions (otherwise Peace and Thought would be OP), but they suggested there is a "phaseless" action window between the end of combat and beginning of refresh.

That's not entirely true: you can respond to things that occur at the "end of the phase/round" (eg, Gandalf leaves play at the end of the round, you respond with Horn of Gondor).

 

Responses act as an "interrupt" or an "instant", but they are still "things that happen after the beginning-of-the-end of the phase/round".

 

The true "end of phase" is not defined as "nothing else happens after it in this phase, except other end-of-turn effects". It's defined as "the players choose to make no additional Action printed on player cards or framework actions such as attacking". Since players have already opted-out of making actions, they can't change their mind.

If you want to be truly pedantic with this (awfully) written rulebook, you can interpret it such that players don't even have an action window in the Refresh Phase. This is what it says:

 

Phase 7: Refresh

 

During the refresh phase, all exhausted cards ready, each player increases his threat by 1, and the first player passes the first player token to the next player clockwise on his left. That player becomes the new first player. Play then proceeds to the resource phase of the new round.

 

The implication here is that those things happen immediately after another "during" the refresh phase. There are two sets of verbs here that are unclear:

  1. What is "during" the refresh phase. Is that at the player's whim? Or does it really mean "at the start of the refresh phase"? Or does it mean "immediately after the start of the refresh phase?"

  2. "Play then proceeds to the resource phase of the new round". That directly conflicts with the "Turn Sequence" diagram, which indeed has a green window after passing the token, as there is a "direct omission" of the ability for players to play cards here, since the phase "then" implies an immediate succession (the same as Caleb's "to" ruling).

 

We're going to address #2 first. Clearly, the game intends players to have an action window "sometime" during the Refresh phase, or there wouldn't be all these player cards with Refresh actions printed on them. As noted earlier in this thread, players get actions before and after "steps".  Since there must be a player action "somewhere" in the refresh phase, one of the following must be true:

  1. There is a player window immediately after the "start of the phase/round" (you may play PLaT here)

  2. There is a player window immediately before the "end of the phase/round" EXCEPT in the Resource phase ("play then proceeds..."). (no valid window for ANY refresh actions)

  3. At least one of 4 "framework events" must be defined as a step. You could consider all 4 as one large "step" similar to the Staging step. Alternatively, you could consider each one an individual step. If only 1 of the 4 "framework events" is defined as a step, the rulebook offers us no guidance.

 

What is "during" the refresh phase? To occur in the refresh phase, it must occur after the start, but before the end. The literal interpretation is: All 3 of these framework events must occur during the refresh phase in order for the refresh phase to be considered complete. That's all. It doesn't even mandate that the 3 framework events occur in a specific order, or must occur one after the other.

Page 31 conflicts with Page 22. Rule 31 is a "reference" and has multiple other issues in addition (eg, it misrepresents how Shadow cards actually work while making additional attacks). It also makes obvious omissions such as neglecting to include the proper name of substeps.

One thing i do want to add to this, as a caveat, is that i understand the "intentions" of Caleb, and i do play it the way "Word of God" says i should - but there are still a plurality of inconsistencies and contradictions with the rulebook, FAQ, and Caleb's individual rulings which piss me off (don't get me started on shadow cards for immediate attacks...).
