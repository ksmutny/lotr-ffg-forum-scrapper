okay so im aware that limit once per game is limited per player, and im fine with this

 

i was reading the unoficial faq which linked to a link on a french forum that had a responce apparently from caleb saying that once per round abilities could be triggered again if the card in question left play and we replayed the same round.

The example given was if Erestor was in play and you used his ability, he then left play and you for instance sneek attack him back into play you could use his ability again.

once again, still fine.

 

So here is my question, what about once per phase, and i ask this question because put simply i have no idea which of the above rulesets apply to "once per phase" the only thing i can find is that once per phase and once per round function "as written" so maybe i should lump them in together but then this makes me question "what about the events, can i simply use them over and over ignoring this" that seems a bit silly as what would be the point.

 

So yeh bit confused and wondering if anybody can clarify for me what ruling "once per phase" uses and how this applies to events, thnx.
