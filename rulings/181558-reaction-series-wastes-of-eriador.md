I have decided to start my own series. And rather than doing it on a blog site, I shall do it here. I will post my immediate reactions to each new release, with updated content once the actual experience sets in.

 

Wastes of Eriador

 

Quest/Encounter Cards

 

Nothing yet.

 

Hero

 

Merry

 

Initial thoughts: This must be good. A perfect fit for a Hobbit secrecy deck.

Experience: It is. In a majority of quests, Merry can single-handedly keep you in the secrecy, especially in coop games.

 

Player Cards

 

Ingold

 

Initial thoughts: As many Gondor-theme cards, especially in Leadership, this ally does not scream power. But a copy should be justifiable in just about every Gondor deck. Well, in mid-to-end-game, Gondorian decks should have enough resources to make this guy a valuable quester, add Visionary Leadership and/or Faramir, and he will truly shine. In the crucial early hours, however, it is another story.

Second thoughts: I think it is important enough to say that saga makes this guy even better, every time you are the first player, Ingold has a chance for a bonus willpower. I was recently thinking of an attachment that could "upgrade" an ally into a hero status during the game, wouldn't that be fun (Ingold or not)?

 

Rallying Cry

 

Initial thoughts: Obviously made for the chump blocker decks, Gondor or Rohan, as the art suggests. The response can be quite good when you have many resources and the core Gandalf. The Valour action needs some timing but it can be decisive.

 

Honour Guard

 

Initial thoughts: A welcome new way to cancel damage for Tactics.

Experience: I have been playing this guy since the first preview. It has not always been as good as I had hoped but the safety cushion helps to approach certain difficult situations more boldly.

 

Raven-winged Helm

 

Initial thoughts: Quite powerful, especially if it is not restricted. It makes Beregornd even stronger, since he is one of the few legitimate targets, and it plays for free on him (without taking one of the restricted spots which usually go to the Shield and Spear). Honour Guard is obviously better as a safety against a sudden direct damage dealt to chump blockers or characters in general.

 

Curious Brandybuck

 

Initial thoughts: I am in general very fond of cheap allies. This Hobbit seems like a good chump or a decent one-round quester. Of course, one could find ways to help him stay longer, the question is if it be worth it.

 

Hobbit Pony

 

Initial thoughts: Unfortunately, this seems not very good, although it combos with Merry perfectly. Well, I am already contradicting myself. A hard call but I wish the card did a bit more.

Second thoughts: As suggested below, quest control (and avoiding some exhaustion-punishing treacheries) can be very important, so this is an obvious merit. One probably shouldn't be asking for more for the cost of 0. Similar to Late Adventurer or Don't Be Hasty (which has a far superior art than the other event), only for Hobbits but repeatable, and more easy to fetch.

 

East Road Ranger

 

Initial thoughts: Obviously, he might not be very good in a non-side quest deck.

 

Scout Ahead

 

Initial thoughts: I think this card will be one of the centre-stones to the scrying decks, although it seems quite powerful on its own.

Second thoughts: Whilst I still find this card superb, I am a bit afraid about using side quests. Many recent quests require no lingering about, and the full quest phase devoted to another quest may not always be a good idea. Still, the rewards here seem far greater than on all other spoiled player side quests. And there are some quests where an extra round spent on a given stage is even beneficial (when you're afraid to quest too much).

 

Ranger of Cardolan

 

Initial thoughts: The good thing about this ally is that his stats are good enough, so that you can take the response more as a safety utility. And it is a very good one at that. The fact the card is shuffled into the deck will of course hurt more often than not.

> And you know there are allies that want to leave play just to enter again: hello Silvan. My idea is to have a Valour deck (mono or mostly Leadership) on one side and Silvan deck on the other. At the right moment you play Rallying Cry to block with the likes of Galadhrim Minstrel, Naith Guide or Galadriel's Handmaiden, only to have them enter all the stronger next round.

> By the way, would anyone care scanning and posting the Helm? It would be much welcomed.

 

True, but Silvan tends to have plenty of ways to pull allies back into your hand anyway.

 

> Beorn with Rallying Cry is a confusing one because Rallying Cry says return it to its owner's hand "instead of placing it in the discard pile", and Beorn is shuffled into your deck rather than discarded. But he does leave play. So I don't know if that would work or not.

> The Raven-Winged Helm also sounds cool, but I'm less enthusiastic because the one instance where I really want to cancel damage is hero Beorn and he can't have attachments unless I manage to temporarily blank his text box.
> 
> Also I don't think the Helm would work with Erkenbrand as suggested above, because I think there was a ruling at some point that effects like Erkenbrand and Treebeard don't work unless they actually take the damage. If you cancel the damage, you have not paid the cost of their ability and it doesn't work.

 

With Rallying Cry, I would assume that it only applies to cards that are being discarded, though that might be a good question to send up to Caleb. I think you may also be right about the Helm on Erkenbrand, but it would still help with anyone wearing The Day's Rising, which is great.
