So they're resurrecting Valour as well? That's pretty cool, but it seems to me we're gonna see ships again before we see another Doomed keyword.

 

Pack looks pretty good though. Dat art on Legacy Weapon.

I was going to post that it hasn't been three months since The Black Serpent... until I checked.  I guess they want to have something to sell at Xmas time?  I'm sure with Matt moving to Arkham and Caleb finishing up the sagas he needs a break.  (But I don't have to like it!)

In the mean time I'm going back into the sagas and trying to finish them to my satisfaction.

I suspect it could be more a manifacture issue than a design issue. Probably the high demand for Arkham reprints, the launch of L5R and the erroneous shipping of the 6th pack containing a major erratum took its toll on the release schedule.

As a punishment against those who leaked it? Don't know that punishing the rest of the customers who had nothing to do with this is a particularly wise course of action. 

But perhaps they're just prepping us for a much slower release schedule going forward.

Does anyone know if Caleb is working on other games, like Matt is on the Arkham Horror LCG?

He has given a hand developing one of the faction of L5R, like the rest of the LCG team.

That's the big piece for me. Sean from COTR has said numerous times how he wished there was a betterment in communication from FFG and that they would at least address the delays so as to not leave us in the dark. Well, that upcoming Caleb interview is the perfect time for that, right?

I really doubt this has anything to do with Quickbeam.

Caleb has an interview over on BGG btw.

I love Asmodee!  This has to be so frustrating for Caleb.  Can we please un-merge?

Anyway, assuming the December 8th date is right, it will mean that Open the Armory will be legal for our December 9th Assault on Dol Guldur and will fit nicely into my tactics deck.
