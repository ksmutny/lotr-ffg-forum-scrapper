Heavy Stroke is a Tactics Events and reads:

Response: After a Dwarf deals X damage to an enemy during combat, deal an additional X damage to that enemy. (Limit once per phase.)

I have 2 questions:
1) Multiple characters participate in an attack, but only 1 is a Dwarf.  Are you able to use Heavy Stroke to consider everyone's combined attack as X?  Or just the attack strength of the Dwarf?  That would seem convoluted -- if 3 characters pool their attack to do 1 damage to a 3-shield enemy, it seems like I'd have to tease apart which character actually did the damage.  Maybe the Dwarf contributed 2 attack strength, the secod ally contributed 1, and it was the 1 attack strength of the 3rd ally that actually caused damage. 

2) Does the 'limit once per phase' mean that you can't trigger a second copy of Heavy Stroke, or that you can't recycle the same card and re-use it (e.g., via Hama if you're engaged with at least 3 enemies).

Thanks for responses.

Thanks for pointed that out NM -- I found this here:

Hi Booored,
The way Heavy Stroke is intended to work depends on allowing players to choose which character's attack value is applied to the enemy's defense value. In your example, the optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply Aragorn's attack 3 to the enemy's 1 defense. So Aragorn is dealing 2 damage to the enemy and Dwalin is also dealing 2 damage, at which point you play Heavy Stroke to double Dwalin's damage and make it 4 for a total of 6 damage dealt to the enemy.

Just to clarify it further, let's say Aragorn and Dwalin were attacking an enemy with 4 defense. The optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply all 3 of Aragron's attack plus 1 of Dwalin's to beating the enemy's defensse, then Dwalin would deal 1 damage to the enemy that could be double with Heavy Stroke for a total of 2.

Hope that helps,

So, it does work in this convoluted way.  Gotta say, I think this is a needless complication, but that's what we've got to work with!
