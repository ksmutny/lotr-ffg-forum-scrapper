Nameless Thing attaches player cards to itself.

Forest Snare has the text "Attached enemy cannot attack."

I can't see any reason why a Forest Snare that is attached to Nameless Thing by the effect on NT wouldn't thus ensnare the Nameless Thing and prevent it from attacking. Seems a bit crazy though.

I got my reply from FFG this morning and it surprised me.  I believe it will cause a lot more questions, but this is what Caleb stated:-

The word 'attached' was deliberate as many other rules relate to Attachments.  If Forest Snare is played as an Attachment on a Nameless creature it will add its 'cost' to the enemy as well.

He didn't specify the reverse, but it looks like ANY card attached to a Nameless creature either as an Attachment or through its or other cards effects, will add its cost and apply its ability if appropriate.  Obviously cards that affect Heroes, Dwarves, Allies etc., wont affect an enemy but others may.  Let us hope this doesn't lead to more problems.  I think jjeagle has had clarification about a Hero being attached to a Nameless thing.  I shall now have to start playing this method and see what effects it has.  Cheers!

Could you please post your question, too? Because it seems like Caleb answered the question "What happens if a player pays 3 and attaches Forest Snare to a Nameless enemy" and some of us are talking about "What happens if a Forest Snare is attached to a Nameless enemy by its forced effect"…

My own Q&A on this (and other issues) are now posted in full on this thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=284&efcid=4&efidt=678928]. I think this clears up most of the FOS rules issues.

It makes no sense in terms of game rules.

Attachment card types are attached during the planning phase by the player.

Player cards from player deck are attached to Elder Things when they engage, and by sharing the same word "attach" - it's a completely diffrent mechanic, attaching all - events, attachments, allies. And in this mechanic card text doesn't matters, the only thing that matters is cost.  



I love that Caleb officially ruled that the Forest Snare works!

So much for 'makes no sense' demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]
