Since I saw this "combo" mentioned a few times lately I wanted to see where the consensus lay about this matter:

Let's say I have a Winged Guardian in play and a Meneldor's Flight/Flight of the Eagles in hand. Presuming the Guardian doesn't take damage from the attack can I use the action window between steps 6.4.3 and 6.4.4 of the combat phase to return the Guardian in my hand to still consider the attack defended and save it from its own Forced effect? (The same question could be asked about a Vassal of the Windlord and stept 6.8.3/6.8.4)

On one hand I am not totally sure if the enemy attack "resolves" after 6.4.3 or 6.4.4, and how it relates to an attack being undefended. If it resolves at 6.4.3 and in that Action Window afterwards it would be possibile make the defending character leave play and still consider the attack defended than it might even lead to some fun uses of our old friend coaster Keen-Eyed Took. If it resolves at 6.4.4 it would make more sense in general to me.

In any case I think that before we have access to an Action Window after the "attack resolves" step (whichever it is) the forced effect will take effect, having a game frame precedence over any Response or Action, so this "combo" does not work.

First, the language about undefended is very similar between the original rules and the RR.

Original:

> Quote
> 
> If an attack is undefended, all damage from the attack must be assigned to a single hero controlled by the active player. Allies cannot take damage from undefended attacks. If a defending character leaves play or is removed from combat before damage is assigned, the attack is considered undefended. A character’s [defense] does not absorb damage from undefended attacks or from card effects.

RR:

> Quote
> 
> If an attack is undefended, all damage from the attack must be assigned to a single hero controlled by the active player. If a defending character leaves play or is removed from combat before damage is assigned, the attack is considered undefended. A character’s [defense] does not absorb damage from undefended attacks.

The relevant old ruling from Nate is probably this one:

https://boardgamegeek.com/article/8025656 [https://boardgamegeek.com/article/8025656]

In particular,

> Quote
> 
> The attack resolves at the conclusion of the final step, so again, Forced effects should occur before players have a chance to take actions.

Since under the original rules, the "final step" was damage dealing, rescuing a Vassal/Guardian was indeed not allowed. But this was under the original rules' formulation where there was no real equivalent to 6.4.4; I argue the RR now makes this the final step of an (enemy) attack instead.

If anyone wants to re-ask Caleb, feel free, but until then, for me, this is one of those blessed few cases where the RR actually helped us.

To ask Caleb questions where should I write?

(This is the conduit via which nearly all of our official rulings have arrived.)

I got Caleb's answer and it confirms we can use the Action Window between determining damage and the end of the attack to get the Winged Guardian back in hand

Presuming the Guardian doesn't take damage from the attack can I use the action window between steps 6.4.3 ("determine combat damage") and 6.4.4 ("enemy attack ends") of the combat phase to return the Guardian in my hand, still consider the attack defended (since damage was already determined) and save it from its own Forced effect (which should come into play after step 6.4.4)?

> Nate’s previous ruling pre-dates the expanded timing chart included in the online rules reference, so it’s fair to say that it is out dated. There is an action window after damage is applied and before the attack ends, so it is possible for you to return the Winged Guardian to your hand with either event you mentioned at that time to avoid losing it to its Forced effect.
