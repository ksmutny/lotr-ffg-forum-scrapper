# [Treebeard + Gimli + Song of Mocking = crazy combo??](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174520-treebeard-gimli-song-of-mocking-crazy-combo/)

Not sure if this is legitimate or not, so wanted to pose this to the forums to see if its a valid combo or not.

 

So would using Treebeard's ability and putting the damage on Gimli from song of mocking still net Treebeard his stat boosts? It would be kinda crazy, and cool for that matter to have the potential to quest for 6 and attack for 6 using only two heroes and 1 player card.

 

Thoughts?

This one is not perfectly analogous as the wording is different, but here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/130200-dori-gloin-combo/?hl=gloin] is a thread stating that Gloin can't get resources if Dori is used to intercept his damage.  The official response is this:

 

"You cannot trigger Gloin’s ability unless you actually place the damage tokens on him. Dori’s ability intercepts the damage before it is placed on the hero.
