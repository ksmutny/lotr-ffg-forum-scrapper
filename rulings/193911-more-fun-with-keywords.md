Can a player OTHER than the one revealing an encounter card with the Peril keyword play Don't Be Hasty! ? This could be theoretically useful for, say, readying an emergency chump blocker against a Warrior of Dunland.

Peril does resolve, though, same as all other encounter card keywords. The trigger for most of them (Peril included) is when they are revealed, and the resolution is whatever effect they do.

 

Doomed triggers when the card is revealed, and resolves when all players increase their threat by the indicated amount, or Doomed is somehow prevented (the only card I can think of that can do this is The Door is Closed, but there may be others).

 

Surge triggers when the card is revealed, and resolves after the additional card it reveals is finished resolving, or Surge is somehow prevented (again, the only card I can think of that can do this is The Door is Closed).

 

Peril triggers when the card is revealed, and resolves after the revealed card finishes its normal resolution, with the caveat that only the revealing player may interact with the card in question. Or, once again, Peril is somehow prevented.

 

Don't be Hasty interrupts the keyword's resolution, allowing you to remove and ready a hero commited to the quest. In this case, the keywords and "when revealed" effects then resolve as normal. The Door is Closed interrupts these keywords by discarding the card before the keywords have a chance to trigger in the first place. Note that (at least to my knowledge, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about this) "when revealed" happens before "after reveal[ing]", so a card with a "when revealed" effect triggers it's "when revealed" effect before The Door is Closed cancels and discards the card. According to Caleb, The Door is Closed cancels the card in it's entirety, and play proceeds as if that card were never revealed.

EDIT:

Check the full text for the above keywords; you'll see that each of them includes the text "when a card with the X keyword is revealed[...]" constituting a trigger.

 

EDIT 2:

Quick Ears can also prevent Doomed/Surge/Peril, if the keyword were on an enemy.
