It's just strange wording of Gloin's ability ("...add 1 resource for each...") makes me think that when Gloin suffers damage - Harbor Master gets exact amount of bonus defense as the damage Gloin suffered?

Hmmm actually im agree this is one action. Gloin get x damage but Harbor will get only 1 defence. According to FAQ and last official rule fix is right. im pretty sure. But better send letter to Caleb no?

The answer from Caleb:

If Gloin takes 3 damage and gains 3 resources as a result, it is still only 1 instance of resources being added to that heroâ€™s resource pool, which means that the Harbor Master can only get +1 defense as a result.
