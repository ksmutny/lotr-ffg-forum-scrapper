Doesn't it seem to you guys that the deckbuilding in this game revolves mostly around the tribal theme? There's the dwarf deck, a hobbit build, the gondor or silvan deck,... I own most of the cards (2 hobbit exp, 2 regular exp. and 8 ch.p's), and often there's just not that many options. Apart from a couple of interchangables depending on location or enemy faced, there's just "the deck". Maybe I missed some cards I initially dismissed as "totally crappy". Of course you can still experiment with colour combinations, that much is true. But I'm often at a loss to freshen my decks up. So some hints are welcome, as always.

 

Imo there should be more universal cards, like the classic card manipulation: "draw 2, discard 1", "look at top 4 and take 1", damage on critters, mana manipulation, etc etc. The tribal theme kinda excludes it from a lot of decks.

Wow, be careful with that edge, booored.

 

As someone who's very interested in european folklore and culture (and thus fantasy literature as a study of the former, which is pretty much how Tolkien can be resumed), I disagree with you in that everybody who likes fantasy is off in the head. The thing is that, besides all that, this is a LOTR based card game. Everyone has said that already, and so I will again. Lunatics or not, this game is focused to people who are interested in Tolkien's world, and they're it's main source of income. I'd say that about 70% of players are indeed theme players, and when you have such a large portion of your crowd in that category, you have to focus your efforts on pleasing that category. If you read Caleb's articles, you can see how they've been doing exactly that, and most of the preview articles have been about theme and story and whatnot, so the focus on isn't going away anytime soon. LOTR is one of the biggest fantasy franchises ever and one with some of the most ardent fanbases, so really, what did you expect when you join a community based around this game? To go in the forums and tell people that they're nuts because they don't have the same taste as you? Really? Anyway, it's obvious that this game was designed for Tolkien fans, and ust because you're an enlightened minority doesn't mean everyone has to accomodate to your opinions in a community forum, let alone the developers of this game.

 

Tribal decks make sense in a game such as this. Much like they would in a Dark Ages based lcg with the britons, vikings, saxons etc. Do they make sense machanically? Maybe not to you. Do they make sense thematically? Hell yes. And guess what, this game is focused on theme.

 

That said, I still wouldn't like to see them only focus on traits, since that would, as you say, make for an "artificial" deckbuilding guideline. I agree on that. However, I still see that this game has a very high level of thematic customization since you can, and in fact it's also endorsed, make a deck with Dunhere, Elrond and Thalin as your heroes. Wasn't the fellowship of the ring exactly that? A collection of unlikely races joining up to go on an adventure? I think there's really no more need for a tribal focus than the one they're already doing.
