I found out a way to avoid earning the burden card Poisoned Counsels in the scenario Helm's Deep while still going to stage 1. This exploit can prevent all but one of the players from earning it.

It actually uses a card that was dubbed the "worst card of the Ring-maker Cycle" on TftC -- no, not Mirkwood Pioneer -- but Message

From Elrond! Each player who wants to pull it off needs a copy of Poisoned Counsels in his hand (Gather Information anyone?) and a copy of Message From Elrond.

On the last round of the game, in the action window right before the last enemy is killed, each player sends Poisoned Counsels via Message From Elrond to one unlucky player. The Campaign card says that each player with a copy of Poisoned Counsels earns it, not each copy of Poisoned Counsels is earned, so the players who used this trick don't earn it and the player who received all of the cards only earns 1.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this.

I messaged Caleb and he agrees with GrandSpleen--one player would indeed end up with all copies. He is also glad I am enjoying Helm's Deep. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Good to hear that Caleb is not yet tired of us enjoying the quests.Â  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
