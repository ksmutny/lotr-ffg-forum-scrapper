Both cards refer to add/remove tokens on the current quest. But i read that actually "current quest" means also a active location for Legolas, but for Misty Mountains Goblins, the active location is not taken into account and the token should be removed from the current quest? Is that right? And are there any cards related to the "current quest" that actually affect or not the active location?

According to a reply from Caleb (regarding the Battle of Pelennor Fields quest):

So according to this, an encounter card effect that places progress on the current quest will bypass the active location.
