Crossing of Poros "on the boat" as of 12/1/17... now let's see how long it takes before it ships to retailers.

I don't believe that for a second.  I believe that with Caleb working on the DCG they knew that Rhovanion wasn't going to be released until this summer and so the started to delay the releases instead of having a 9 to 12 month break.

No way.  There is simply no way that there won't be more demands on Caleb's time.  We have a new normal now which will be slower than the old normal.  (As inconceivable as that is.)
