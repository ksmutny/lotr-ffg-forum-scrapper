# [The Burglar&#039;s Turn and Travelling to Locations](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303966-the-burglars-turn-and-travelling-to-locations/)

Complicated question for you all there are lots of different effects that can make a location the active location, is that the same as travelling? Other card specify that you can travel to a location such as Strider's Path or Ghan-Buri-Ghan so does that trigger A Burgler's Turn? Do The Hidden Way, West Road Traveller, South Away, Mariner's Compass and Distant Stars count as travelling? And finally can locations with the attached cards that enter the staging area be cleared by placing progress tokens on them and then still count as explored and grant the guarded attachment? 

 

So is the following hypothetical situation legit: could you Strider's Path a location during questing, clear it (and gain a burgled attachment) travel to another one normally, clear that with The Evening Star (gaining another burgled attachment), travel to another one with Ghan-Buri-Ghan (attaching another burgled attachment) then clear that with another copy of the Evening Star, then swap it with Thror's Map and clear that final location with yet another copy of The Evening Star? For a net total of four attachments in one round?

If I may, i did see this in the FAQ and Caleb's revised ruling in a forum. However, the language of Caleb's ruling was the playing of attachments (i.e. from hand) was an illegal move. But because these attachments are not played, but attached as a "guarded objective".

Further, the nature of "forced" has me questioning this because if it were a response I would solidly say this is a #1. But forced effects, according to the rule book, "initiate and resolve, whether the players want them to or not." I scanned the faq for forced effects vs immunity, and while I tend to agree with you, contracts have been given their own special framework and thus this might be allowed under the second paragraph of 1.47 (immune, expanded). Further, because the location itself isn't "chosen" by the players, the "targeting" paragraph might not apply.

Perhaps I should've quoted earlier in the FAQ also:

> Quote
> 
> Cards with the text "Immune to player card effects" ignore the effects of all player cards. This means that player card effects cannot directly influence or interact with a card that is immune to player card effects. 

and to excerpt the RR:

> Quote
> 
> If a card is immune to a specified set of effects, it cannot be chosen as the target for or affected by effects that belong to that set.

I think Caleb would say that putting an attachment on a card, even if it is as a guarded objective, counts as "directly interacting with"/"affecting" that card. The general corpus of rulings has always been consistent with the principle that a card that is immune to player card effects cannot receive a player card attachment through any player card means. If The Burglar's Turn allows it, it would be a first AFAIK—as stated above, I don't think it does.

Sounds good. So now the only question is between situation #1 and #2. I will reach out to see if we get an official response.

According to an official ruling from Caleb, it is case #1. The contract does not trigger.
