Hey, if anyone wants to play, how about meeting up Thursday evening about 6-7pm at the main registration desk.  Star Wars LCG WC should be running down by then (or at least for those who have dropped).  Caleb may be available if he is not working a tourney.

 

Let me know if you are interested.  I am flying in so I would need to know what quests/encounter decks to bring.  I saw a thread before from someone in Minneapolis that may be able to help with quests/encounter decks so all we would need to bring is decks to play.

I realize that many players will be in tourney's on Thursday and Friday.  I am playing in SW on Thursday, XWing on Friday and SW 2v2 on Saturday.  Since I am not likely to be in the mix in any of these events and am not fond of 10-12 hours playing in a tourney, I will probably opt out at some point (for those who may not like me stating that, I will apologize in advance)

 

Caleb may be available on Thursday if he is not judging a tourney.  Lets meet at 7pm Thursday by the badge registration desk and if the posters above will bring the quests, lets have some fun playing.  I will have my player decks if anyone would like to join in that would need one.
