# [Is the Arkham Horror LCG the end of LotR LCG?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/)

Arkham Horror LCG is also a coop LCG.

The Star War LCG was once a coop LCG, but redesigned.

Are two coop LCGs too many for FFG?

 

Does FFG have enough designers for the upcoming LCG?

Will Nate be the designer of AH LCG?

 

Is it the end of LotR LCG?

 

The Product code of the Ruin of Belegost is MEC63, the Grey Haven is MEC47,

there're room for the dreamchasing cycle(48-53), The return of the King saga(54, 55), one deluxe(56), and one more cycle(57-62)

But the delayed previews of the dreamchasing cycle seems to show the dead end of the game.

 

I hope the AH LCG is just the line of COC LCG.

Lord of the Rings LCG has been anything but lax on their interpretations of Tolkien's work and even their custom made content is a good measure of quality above "garbage". Read the Antlered Crowd designer notes to see with how much care and humility Matt and Caleb have approached the IP. Nothing can spoil the original works anyway, especially if one is picky as to whom they work with. There is a difference between between hoarding and being selective. The stories in Silmarilion are overflowing with theme that begs to be retold in other mediums. Yes games (and movies) will never compare to the book as a medium, but should we discard them as worthless? I think not. That is a purist's perspective and a loss for everyone involved.

For clarity, my use of "Action-adventure garbage" was directed at the films.

To get back to the original point, according to Caleb on CoTR Ep 100 they were already developing 2 cycles ahead when The Grey Havens was announced.

 

I have to say that the vibe on Ep 100 (quite long but worth a listen) was extremely positive and you got the impression that both Caleb and Matt are still working on LoTR LCG - which probably means that enough cycles have been locked in until at least 2018.

 

Obviously the game could still be cancelled, but that could happen at any time anyway.

Meaning that with the upcoming release of L5R next year, FFG is taking all my disposable monthly income for several more years.

Yeah, Caleb said they're past 100 quests now not including NM. That's more than enough for another cycle, possibly two. I can't remember the exact maths off the top of my head, but we're around 78-80 at the moment.

9 per cycle x 5 = 45

7 POD

Sagas = 18

Current Cycle = 5

= 75 currently released

Plus the 6 remaining Saga, announced POD Annuminas, and the conclusion of the Dream-chaser = 11

So 86 quests we know about. That leaves room for 2 more cycles, plus the 2 POD's per year. And that's just current development, according to Caleb.

I've listened to that interview, but rally didn't put together that he was referring to unpublished stuff in development...what great news that we've got so much LOTR goodness coming our way!

Related to the future of LOTR (which, as stated above, I think is bright) ....So I was looking at the credits for the Grey Havens and Matt is the Designer for that box. He was also recently on COTR.  So it seems he has been still working on LOTR during the creation of AH.  Does anyone know if he is going to maintain involvement in both games going forward?  Maybe someone got to talk to him at Gen Con?  

 

I guess I could view it as a win either way (because AH looks really cool and I'm planning on jumping into it on the ground floor), but his work on the last few cycles of LOTR has been really awesome and I'd be bummed to see him leave entirely.  

 

Oh and Caleb rocks too ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ... I think it is mostly that LOTR is in such a great place currently that I hate to see any disruption to a team doing such great work!

We don't know is the short answer...but in the COTR Ep 100 Interview two or so months ago, there was no sign that either Matt or Caleb were stopping working on LoTR. In fact the whole 3 hour interview was extremely positive (they come across as really good guys), and bearing in mind they work 18 months or so in advance they could be at 2 least cycles ahead internally to what we are seeing.

 

Looking at the Gameslore (UK online shop) list of top sellers, three LoTR LCG packs are currently in the top 15 list of top selling games. Plus if you look at BGG new people are rocking up all the time. The game will of course end one day, but there's absolutely no sign of that at the moment. And even if it does, there is a ton of content anyway.
