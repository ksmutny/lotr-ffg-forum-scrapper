After a four month wait, new player cards are here! Except for Firefoot (recently spoiled at http://couplevscardboard.com [http://couplevscardboard.com]), the already spoiled cards can be found at http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4592. [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4592.]

 

Celeborn (spoiled)

 

Leadership

Naith Guide (spoiled)

 

Swift and Silent - Event, cost 1; Action: Ready a hero you control. Then, if your threat is 20 or less and this is the first time you played a copy of Swift and Silent this round, return this card to your hand instead of discarding it.

 

Tactics

Firefoot (spoiled)

 

Close Call (spoiled)

 

Spirit

Blue Mountain Trader - Ally, cost 2, 1w 0a 1d 2hp; Dwarf. Action: Choose another player. That player gains control of Blue Mountain Trader. Then, that player moves 1 resource from the resource pool of a hero he controls to the resource pool of a hero you control, or Blue Mountain Trader is discarded.

 

The Fall of Gil-galad - Attachment, cost 1; Song. Limit 1 per deck. Attach to a hero. Response: When attached hero is destroyed, add The Fall of Gil-galad to the victory display to reduce you threat by X, where X is the attached hero's threat cost. Victory 1.

 

Lore

Ithilien Lookout - Ally, cost 3, 1w 2a 0d 2hp; Gondor. Ranger. Secrecy 2. Response: After Ithilien Lookout enters play, look at the top card of the encounter deck. If it is an enemy, you may discard it.

The Tree People (spoiled)

 

Neutral

The White Council - Event, cost X; X is the number of players in the game. Action: Starting with the first player, each player chooses 1 different option: ready a hero he controls, add 1 resource to the resource pool of a hero he controls, draw 1 card, or shuffle 1 card from his discard pile into his deck.

 

Secrecy makes a comeback, and we have our second player card (not counting Treasures) with Victory points. The Fall of Gil-galad combines nicely with Rivendell Minstrel and with either Landroval or Fortune and Fate. 

 

Ithilien Lookout is very good with the secrecy discount, and acceptable without it. Like Miruvor, Swift and Silent can consistently ready different heroes (while your threat is 20 or less). It doesn't have the flexibility of Miruvor, but it also doesn't block your card draw like reusing Miruvor does. It will combo nicely with Leaf Brooch when The Three Trials comes out.

 

It might be surprising to see more support for dwarves, but Blue Mountain Trader is a nice addition that isn't overpowered. It's reminiscent of Wandering Took and Rider of the Mark. Outside of a dwarf deck it might be useful for moving resources, and it's only the second non-unique Spirit dwarf.

 

I'm not sure how good The White Council will be. None of its effects are especially powerful, but it provides versatility and, since it's neutral, it might compensate for a sphere's weaknesses.

Yes, Blue Mountain Trader does create an infinite defense loop combo with Harbor Master. Good catch. Moving resources adds resources to another hero, as officially ruled by Caleb. Thus, you could just toss it back and forth forever until his defense is infinite...

We asked Caleb about this for our Progression Series review - it does not work.
