If I cancel the effects of the first Goblin revealed during the round with The Door is Closed!, does it still count as the first enemy revealed that round? Or was it never revealed, and the next Goblin I reveal will gain surge?

Quick Ears says:

Is the situation any different for Quick Ears, where I cancel the entire card, not just its effects?

I have asked to Caleb (that I thank).

This is the answer:

Hi Emilio,
If you cancel the first Goblin revealed with The Door is Closed or Quick Ears, it is still the first enemy to be revealed. Canceling that card also cancels the surge granted to it by Bolg’s ability. If you reveal another Goblin enemy after the first one, it will not gain surge because it is not the first Goblin revealed that round.
I hope you’re enjoying The Battle of Five Armies!
Cheers,
Caleb

Mmm .. i'm not with Caleb .. if you cancel a complete card, then this card was never in the game. 
@Seastan: I think about your list of points what happened by revealing a card and where to cancel effects a time ago, where Quick Ears and Wingfoot interacts a common way .. so i you can't use Wingfoot of a canceled enemy via Quick Ears, how can Bolg interact with that enemy and add an effect?

Hmm. You're right this does seem at odds with the Wingfoot ruling.
