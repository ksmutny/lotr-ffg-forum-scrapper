So Morgul Bodyguard (from Morgul Vale) has a shadow effect that reads:

 

"Attacking enemy engages the next player and makes an immediate attack, if able."

 

This is different from other shadow effects which begin with "after this enemy attacks..."

 

I believe it's already clear that if you're playing solo, there's no "next" player so this would not have any effect.

 

The question I have is: does this interrupt his current attack so that it would not complete or deal damage to the defending character?

 

also: If there are other shadow cards in combination with this one, do their effects still trigger (ie "raise your threat by X") before he moves to the next player and starts a new attack (which would recieve a new shadow card)?

Got a response from Caleb!

Hi Matthew,

Great question. If there is no other player for the enemy to attack, then it is not able. In that case, the shadow effect is ignored and the attack resolves as normal. If there was another player, this shadow effect would end the current attack and immediately begin a new attack. Since you reveal shadow cards one at a time, if there are unrevealed shadow cards on the attacking enemy when this effect triggers, they would be discarded when this enemy makes a new attack and is dealt a new shadow card.

Hope you're enjoying the scenario!

Cheers,

Caleb

I am losing in this. FAQ 1.7 (1.32) Mid-Attack Control or Engagement Change says that if enemy engages another player during the resolution of an attack, that attack still resolves.

I thought that the shadow card is dealt to enemy only at the beginning of combat phase. Unless the shadow effect says otherwise.
