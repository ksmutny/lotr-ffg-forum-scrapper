# [Forth Eorlingas! and &quot;Immune to player card effects&quot; enemies](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224931-forth-eorlingas-and-immune-to-player-card-effects-enemies/)

## 1 [sappidus on July 14, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224931-forth-eorlingas-and-immune-to-player-card-effects-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=2308826)

I'm just logging this here for the record...

This came up after someone realized it's possible to have maps in Temple of the Deceived that are impossible to win (fantastically unlikely but a cool little discovery, check it out here [https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrlcg/comments/4sby9y/impossible_map_for_temple_of_the_deceived/]). In brainstorming ways to get around the map lock, someone else brought up using Forth Eorlingas! to attack the Temple Guardian, which says:

 

Combat Action: Each Rohan hero can be declared as an attacker against enemies in the staging area this phase.

It kind of seemed like Forth shouldn't work, as the Temple Guardian is Immune to player card effects, but it wasn't actually completely clear to me that Forth Eorlingas! doesn't work the same way that Quick Strike does: make some sort of modification to the declaration of "framework" attacks. Since Immune enemies are (of course) still susceptible to framework attacks, maybe Forth could work...? (As per the FAQ, Hands Upon the Bow cannot be used against Immune enemies because it forces targeting/choosing of the enemy. Note that this bars Dunhere and Haldir too.)

 

I sent in an official query to get the final word, and here's what I got:

 



> The distinction between Quick Strike’s effect and other similar effects is very subtle, so I understand the confusion around the different rulings. Basically, Quick Strike only works because it allows you to attack an enemy that you could typically attack. It just changes the time at which that attack takes place. The reason that effects like Hands Upon the Bow and Forth Eorlingas! do not work against enemies that are immune to player card effects is because you can’t typically attack an enemy in the staging area.

 

So all remains sane. (Except perhaps the fact that Quick Strike does work at all against Immune enemies, but that's another discussion...)

> So any Immune to player effects card is also immune againts a player card that mention any eligible target or ennemy?

 

Remember, Quick Strike works against Immune enemies, despite being worded "Exhaust a character you control to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against any eligible enemy target." So the presence of the word "eligible" is not a good heuristic to evaluate for a card's applicability in Immune situations. As the FAQ puts it for this situation (p. 13), "...the chosen enemy's immunity does not factor." (Again, I consider this one of the most counterintuitive rulings in the game.)

 

Now consider the wording of Haldir: "Combat Action: If you have not engaged an enemy this round, exhaust Haldir of Lórien to declare him as an attacker (and resolve his attack) against an enemy not engaged with you." This is very, very similar to Quick Strike -- if you can come up with an argument that separates the two in this situation, I would love to hear it.

 

Otherwise, let's take the FAQ again:

 



> Q: What counts as a “ranged” attack?
> 
> A: A ranged attack is an attack made by a character with the ranged keyword against an enemy engaged with another player.

 

And elsewhere:

 



> A card that is immune to player card effects can still be affected by normal framework effects such as placing progress from questing successfully, engaging an enemy during the encounter phase, or dealing damage through an attack made by a character.

Let's throw in the Core's definition of ranged:



> A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players.

So this is the putative reasoning:

 

* Trigger Haldir's action, declaring him as an attacker against an Immune enemy engaged with someone else.

* Per the above FAQ Q/A, this counts as a ranged attack.

* (???) Per the Quick Strike stuff, it counts as a "normal framework effect" even though a player card Action is involved. To wit: look at Caleb's explanation in the OP of this thread: "Basically, Quick Strike only works because it allows you to attack an enemy that you could typically attack. It just changes the time at which that attack takes place." Haldir's ability, when used against an engaged enemy, can be also be viewed as simply changing the time when a typical attack takes place.

* Thus, per FAQ 1.47, the Immune enemy can still be damaged by it.

 

The question-marked step is the vulnerable point to me, but I do think it works.

 



> So making a ranged attack against an immune enemy is legal? I think 'ranged' is only a word for an effect, which allows the character to target an enemy engaged with another player (same as Dunhere in the staging area) ... im confused?

This highlights the only other weakness in the above argument I can see: someone contending that Immune enemies are even immune to ranged attacks. Are you actually arguing for this, though?

I am thinking that Caleb's distinction between QuickStrike and Hands Upon the Bow/Forth Eorlingas is dubious at best. This feels like a bad ruling/policy.

 

These cards modify the Player capabilities, but the player is still making an attack, and attacks work on immune characters. I think the cards should work.

 

Note, Quick Strike changes when we can attack, but not who (and works on immune).

Ranged changes who we can attack (and works on immune).

Hands Upon the Bow changes who we can attack and when, but for some reason cannot work?

Forth Eorlingas just changes who we can attack, but for some reason cannot work?

 

That set comes across as somewhat incoherent. In all cases, the change seems to be made to the player or player-cards, not the immune card. This should go down fine (much the same way that you can prevent damage to immune characters, because the thing being affected isn't the immune thing).

 

I think life would be much better if they both worked just fine (and if deemed necessary were errata'd to preserve 'current' behaviour/limitations).

Alternatively, I would be content with a rule/ruling that attacks initiated by card effects are considered card effects (which stops QuickStrike as well as Hands/Forth).

 

But the current arrangement is making me sad.

It's worth noting that the original ruling was that Quick Strike and Hands Upon the Bow both worked on Immune enemies. Caleb only later reversed his ruling to the one active today. So he actually switched into this state of affairs.

Got a long mail form Caleb - will attach it later, when home.

 

Short abstract ... Ranged and Sentinel work as normal against/with immune enemies. Effects, which let you attack an immune enemy in the staging area are illegal .. such as Haldir, Hands upon a Bow, Forth Eorlingas and probably Dunhere (Dunhere wasn't directly mentioned in the mail..)

 

So, if Haldirs effect, when attacking an enemy engaged with another player is illegal .. i don't know, haven't asked this.

Looking forward to JanB's full response. Meanwhile, here's what I got from Caleb:

> The ranged and sentinel keywords are abilities that affect the character they appear on, so an enemy'S immunity to card effects does not prevent you from using those keywords. You can use a sentinel character to defend an enemy that is immune to player card effects when it is attacking another player, and you can use a ranged character to attack an enemy engaged with another player too.

(For reference, even though the FAQ nowadays makes his case clear, Dunhere is explicitly mentioned in this ruling: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1086021/official-ruling-dunhere-hands-upon-bow-and-enemies [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1086021/official-ruling-dunhere-hands-upon-bow-and-enemies] )

You can build up several super high attack strength heroes with lots of attachments that grant attack bonuses, such as Gondorian Fire and The Black Arrow. Since the Host’s engagement cost is 50, an event like Unseen Strike can help in a pinch.

## 8 [Distractionbeast on November 7, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224931-forth-eorlingas-and-immune-to-player-card-effects-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=2492409)

Well, the designers get the final official say on all matters, but I'm going to have to deny any correlation to the actual text.  There is little consistent wording between these examples.  Sorry, Matt and Caleb.  I love you guys, but the explanation really doesn't clear this up.

Dunhere's ability is passive and does NOT target enemies at all.  It clearly says that Dunhere can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks.  It is altering his ability to perform a normal attack.  On the other hand, if it read "Choose an enemy in the staging area..." then I could understand the immunity.

Forth Eorlingas could go either way, since it also does NOT target enemies, but just modifies the framework.  Saying that characters can be declared as attackers against enemies in the staging area does not target the enemies.  But I can accept that the designers simply intend it that way.

Hands Upon the Bow uses the targeting as part of its effect.  It does NOT "allow the character to target", but rather directs the player to target the enemy, hence the immunity would apply.  Haldir's effect is structured similarly.  Unfortunately, Quick Strike's wording is almost identical.  Relying on the logic that an eligible target indicates a "normal" attack versus whatever other kinds there are is to read more into the text than is there and without the foundational consistency, we're just reduced to requesting a list of card effects which are affected by immunity and referring to it as we play.

Long term, this is one area where the designers should focus on to develop a consistent vocabulary as classic M:tG did long ago.  In that game, the term "target <cardtype>" always indicated a targeting whereas broad, general effects did not trigger immunities.  

Just for the record, as a rule, Matt and Caleb are knocking this game out of the park (in a good way), so take this as very constructive criticism from a big fan.

Certainly there isn't any correlation to the wording on the cards.  They tried that, and like some other things... they had to change their stance on it again.

The only question you need to ask is "If it were attack phase, and I had no card effect in play, could I attack this target"  If the answer is yes, then you can use a card ability to initiate that attack.  If the answer is no, then there is a player card effect in play, and the targeted card is immune.

 

This is the only way that works consistently with the printed cards, and allows the quests and such to work "as intended."  This basically just allows Quick Attack to work, but if there is any other card effect which works like QA where it simply allows the attack to happen, but doesn't change anything about what that attack would be, then it would also work.

The problem with this statement is that Ranged is a card effect.  So it's not so simple.  Thankfully, the developers cleared that up for us by telling us Ranged and Sentinel are not affected immune despite being card effects.  What Distractionbeast said is true although I think it would be easier to move forward making a list of effects that are not affected by immunity and to just assume everything else is until told otherwise.  Although, that still requires us to ask.

In summary (due to developer clarification):

 

1.  Quick Strike, Ranged, and Sentinel are NOT affected by immune. 

2.  Additionally, damage cancellation and resource pools are eligible to be manipulated even if that character is immune.

3.  Immunity does not apply while out of play, although the victory display may be an exception to this rule (not sure)

Asked Caleb about Haldir's action - if it considered as a ranged attack when attacking an enemy engaged with another player:

> Quote
> 
> Hi Jan,
> 
> Haldir's effect targets an enemy. Enemies that are immune to player card effects cannot be targeted by player card effects. Therefore, an enemy that is immune to player card effects cannot be targeted by Haldir’s effect.When Haldir uses his effect, it is not considered a ranged attack. Ranged attacks are described in the core rules under the Ranged keyword. When a character with the Ranged keyword declares an attack against an enemy engaged with another player via the Ranged keyword, that is a ranged attack. When you declare Haldir as an attacker via his ability, that is different.
