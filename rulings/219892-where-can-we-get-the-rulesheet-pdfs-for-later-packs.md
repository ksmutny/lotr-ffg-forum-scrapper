# [Where can we get the rulesheet PDFs for later packs?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219892-where-can-we-get-the-rulesheet-pdfs-for-later-packs/)

Although I have bought all the expansions and cycle packs which are available (except the nightmare decks), I find myself playing exclusively on OCTGN, so I don't open the packs anymore (in case I want to sell them later).  Therefore, in order to play each pack, I am reliant on the rulesheet PDFs that FFG posts on their support page:

Unfortunately, FFG seems to have stopped uploading rulesheet PDFs for later packs; the last one they posted was for Across the Ettenmoors (on 14 September 2015). 

This means there's currently no way for me to read the rules (without opening the packs) for the following:

 

1) The Treachery of Rhudaur

2) The Battle of Carn Dum

3) The Dream Realm

4) The Grey Havens

5) Flight of the Stormcaller

 

Also, I wonder if there are rulesheets for the standalone scenarios:

 

6) Massing at Osgiliath

7) Battle of Lake-town

8) Stone of Erech

9) The Old Forest

10) Fog on the Barrow Downs

11) The Ruins of Belegost

12) Murder at the Prancing Pony

 

Although I am still making my way through the Khazad Dum cycle (which means I might reach The Treachery of Rhudaur in about 10 years!), I'm still a bit of a completionist when it comes to collecting stuff, so I would really love to have all the rulesheets (except for the nightmare decks) in PDF format (or GIF/JPG/PNG if no such PDF exists). 

 

Does anyone know where I can find the ones I listed above?

 

Thanks!

Man, I wish they would make 1 to 5 available, so I can put them on the quest companion.

Afaik, there is no pdf files for the others but you can found all rules on the quest companion.

I even sent a message to Caleb who forwarded me to the marketing services of FFG. That was 3 months ago at least. The service answered me with like a 2 months notice saying it'd be done soon...
