Ceorl's card text reads

> Quote
> 
> Action: Spend 1 <spirit> resource to ready Ceorl. Then, you may give control of Ceorl to another player. Any player may trigger this action. (Limit once per phase).

Does "another player" mean "a player other than the one triggering this action" or "a player other than the one currently controlling Ceorl"? I would interpret it as the former, but this really cuts down the versatility of this action. In a two-player game, you need Ceorl's owner to have Spirit or you can't pass control.

I was wrong!

Ceorl says, "Spend 1 :spirit: resource to ready Ceorl. Then, you may give control of Ceorl to another player. Any player may trigger this action." Who does the "you" refer to, Ceorl's (initial) controller, or the player who triggered the action?

More generally, for these abilities that can be triggered by any player, does it mean that the triggering player initiates the trigger and pays the cost, but the card controller actually resolves the ability? Or does it work another way? Thanks!
