Just note. i think a game is really going well now. With all new balanced in my opinion really balanced new player cards and encounter decks game is come to serious level same as any competitive tournament card game as Android, MTG and GOT.

 

Now in Nmode even with powerful decks and veteran players you still can lose even when you are think you ok. That big improve and good designer job. Caleb make  good job and i would like thank him for  that. Now wait news from GenCon!
