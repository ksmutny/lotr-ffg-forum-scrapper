What happens when a card such as Ithilien Tracker or Ranger Spikes is being used, and an enemy with Ambush is revealed?  So you have Ranger Spikes in the staging area unattached, or you have Ithilien Tracker using his lower threat ability.  When the enemy is revealed, does it immediately make an engagement check before the Ranger Spikes or Ithilien Tracker can take effect?

> But here's a question:  when an enemy has "When Revealed" text, that text is resolved before the enemy goes into the staging area (pg 13 in current FAQ).  Keywords like Ambush and Surge are resolved when a card is revealed-- I assume that's got to happen after the enemy is added to the staging area.  It would be very awkward to hold an enemy card with "Surge" in limbo, reveal the next card, and then add the original enemy to the staging area.  But it looks like this is exactly what happens with a card like Orc Horn Blower [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1306], whose "when revealed" text forces players to reveal the next card.  What state is the Horn Blower in, exactly, while that card is being revealed?  He's not in the staging area, but he's in play?  In play but nowhere in particular?  

 

Caleb didn't said limbo, but I remember he said that ennemies making attack as a When revealed effect where not yet in the staging area.
