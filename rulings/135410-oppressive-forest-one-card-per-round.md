# [Oppressive Forest - One card per round](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135410-oppressive-forest-one-card-per-round/)

This is the card:

And the question is: you have played cards in planning phase, this location is revealed in quest phase..., can you play 1 card after? or the number of last cards in same round remains for this location effect?

I repeat the question: You played one card after this location was revealed, after, can you play the 1 card... or first card (played in planning phase) counts in this effect, and you can't play another card till next round?

That's funny, this exact question came up in my play group last weekend.  We didn't reach a consensus.

 

My thought was that you cannot play another card. Just reading the card literally, it doesn't matter if you have played a card before Oppressive Forest is revealed.  You've still "played one card" this round and shouldn't be able to play another.

 

The counterargument was that card games typically do not "track" your past actions (such as: defeating Ungoliant's Spawn in Passage through Mirkwood before the 3rd quest stage), so you should be able to play one more card after this one comes out.

 

Anyone have any convincing argument that will eliminate one of those options?  They contradict each other but neither really refers to a rule that is written somewhere, just intuitive understanding of game mechanics.  But they can't both be right!

 

Probably a good one for Caleb.

Interesting! I am afraid it is not possible to determine for sure.

 

Personally, I am strongly leaning towards the first option. As you said, we have no rules and no previous cases addressing this issue. In such case a literal understanding of the card is the simplest way to determine the mechanism.

 

The way I see it we should simply make the test: is Oppressive Forest in the staging area? YES. Did you play a card this round? YES. So no more cards for you, pal. I do not see how the moment of revealing the card should modify this test.

 

Also, the argument in favor of the second option that the games do not backtrack progress is not really persuasive for me. I am not experienced with other card games co I cannot comment meaningfully. But even if that is indeed the case with other games, I would expect it follows from some explicit rules (or rulings) in those games. We seem to have none of those in LotR so why create something.

We also have that card:

 

Through-the-Marsh-A-Forgotten-Land-2B.jp [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Nin-in-Eilph/Through-the-Marsh-A-Forgotten-Land-2B.jpg]

 

with similar, if not the same, effect.

 

BUT, in comparison to an answer from Caleb for my question regarding effects of Asfaloth, as to me these two "cannot" effects seem similar:

 

                 Q: When I reveal Snowdrifts treachery card, but I have already used Asfaloth in this round to place 2 progress tokens on active location, can I still add 3 progress or only 1?

 

Snowdrifts.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Road-Darkens/Snowdrifts.jpg]

 

                 A: Only 1.

 

I'd say that if a card has already been played that round in planning phase, no more cards can be played.

I was one of the folks arguing that game mechanics may not remember what has happened before they were in play in that game. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] However, based on that ruling on Snowdrifts, it seems they may indeed track things before they are in play, and thus the forest would limit you even if it popped up after the card had been played for the round.

Screw it, I'm asking Caleb...  And he replied pretty much instantly.

So that's consistent with Snowdrifts.  I'm also curious about this Ungoliant's Spawn ruling.
