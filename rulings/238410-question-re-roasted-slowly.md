Am playing Conflict at the Carrock solo and this just came up -- If Roasted Slowly is drawn during the Quest phase but no Heroes are presently sacked, does it get reshuffled into the deck or (preferably!) discarded?

Roasted Slowly:: When Revealed: Destroy all heroes with the card 'Sacked!' attached. Then, shuffle Roasted Slowly back into the encounter deck.


> The difference between ‘all’ and ‘each’ is very significant because ‘all’ can include 0 whereas ‘each’ requires there to be at least 1 target. For example, with a When Revealed effect that read: “All engaged enemies make an immediate attack. Then, each player discards the top card of his deck.” the second effect will always trigger, even if there are no enemies in play. But, if that effect read: “Each engaged enemy makes an immediate attack. Then, each player discards the top card of his deck.” the second effect will only trigger if at least 1 enemy made an attack.

The 'Then, " requires the first clause succeeds before the second clause can resolve.

But, since 'all' can legally include '0', the first clause does always succeed, so the second always happens. You shuffle it back even if you had no sacked heroes.

Legalese strikes again!
