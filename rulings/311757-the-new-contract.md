A mate just sent me these screen shots. 

Is this legit?

I can't seem to find any rulings on whether "set a value to X" counts as increasing or reducing that value for the sake of effects that trigger on increases or reductions, or effects that forbid increases or reductions.

Yeah, Caleb made a ruling with the example of Saruman and Pillars of the Kings. Basically any effect that lowers the value of your threat dial is "threat reduction", no matter which verb is used in the card effect. So Pillars of the Kings would not help you here.

That makes sense, even though it contradicts the rules of L5R. But then, L5R is a competitive game, where the "cannot be reduced" effect is probably coming from the other player's deck and shouldn't necessarily be favored over the "set" effect. Whereas here, the "cannot be reduced" text is almost certainly coming from the encounter deck, or is a penalty on powerful cards like Saruman and bypassing that penalty would make them OP. So it makes sense here to have a different ruling in LotR than the ruling in L5R.
