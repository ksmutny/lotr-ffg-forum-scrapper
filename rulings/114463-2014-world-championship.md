I put my glasses on but I don't see Lord of the Rings LCG.

Caleb has stated many times that he does read the forums. It's how he meta games the quests in order to challenge popular strategies.

That said I don't believe that this game works in a tournament format and I think FFG agrees.

I wonder what Caleb has to do with anything related to tournaments.
